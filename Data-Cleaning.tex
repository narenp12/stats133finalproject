Everything                         he sees  seems            sexual.            It\n          is as if he has seen all     of this                         for his entire             life    but\n          never  noticed  it before.\n\n          He sees-\n\n          A normal     looking         middle        aged WOMANwalking                   down     the     street.\n          He looks     away as         if she        is pure sex.\n\n          A gorgeous      eighteen         year       old        GIRL with        no bra        and     a low       cut   T-\n          shirt.\n          He turns     away      and    tries        to     hide     at    a newsstand.               He looks\n          down.\n\n          QUICK CUTS--every             cover        is     of     a gorgeous,          busty     woman.\n\n          He walks    away and stops     at a bus stop,  just   wanting to get\n          home.     The bus pulls    up and on the side    of it is a billboard\n          of a perfume     ad with a naked man and a naked woman.         We only\n          see their    bodies,    no faces.   It could  not be dirtier.\n\n          Andy panics       and starts       running     down               the street.          As he runs\n          the bus pulls        out and is driving           at              the same rate          of speed      as\n          Andy.       He can not escape         this   dirty                billboard       no matter       how\n          fast    he runs.       Finally     the bus stops                    at the next        light     and he\n          loses     it,  but immediately          a new bus                 drives     parallel        to him\n          with an even dirtier           billboard       of a               couple,      bodies      naked    and\n          intertwined,        clearly    doing      something                 he's    never     done.\n\n          Andy cuts    right and starts    running      through  a neighborhood.\n          He cuts   through  houses   and lawns.        He sees two DOGS having\n          furious   sex on a lawn.      He cuts    into    the woods and runs and\n          runs .\n\n• 4,,,,\n\n                                                                                                                 19.\n\n\n\n     INT.     ANDY'S APARTMENT\n\n     Andy runs in and closes       the                        door.   He lies  down on his                     bed and\n     turns   on the TV.    He channel                          surfs.    Every commercial                      and\n     program   has something   filthy                          on it.\n\n     -A soap      opera       with         people       kissing.\n\n     -A commercial             for     Viagra.\n\n      Paris      Hilton        almost         naked          on Entertainment                 Tonight.\n\n     -Teenagers         making         out        on MTV.\n\n     -A dirty    rap video                 with       tons         of barely        dressed       women and a\n     ripped   rapper.\n\n     He shuts       the       TV and         closes          his     eyes      as   tightly       as humanly\n     possible.\n\n     Suddenly  we hear the sounds      of his elderly   neighbors\n     laughing,  then having   very loud sex.       The wall behind                                             Andy\n     bangs and shakes.     Then stops.     Then bangs and shakes                                               even\n     louder.\n\n     Andy runs         into      the       bathroom.\n\n\n     INT.

Andy does not pick up\n     on this.\n\n                                                 TRISH\n                      Put     one      of         these   on.\n\n     Andy st.ares    at the             basket,     not sure what to do.      He has never\n     worn a condom.       He            slowly    takes  one out.     He reaches   under\n     the sheets,     and we             can 1 t see what he is doing but it is\n     obvious    that   he is            tearing     the wrapper   open and attempting    to\n     put the condom on.\n\n     Something        goes     wrong.

The same                            thing       happens.   For reasons\n     which are not clear,     he can not                            figure       out how to get this\n     condom on properly.\n\n     Andy attempts    this     many more times.     In quick cuts    we see him\n     struggle    with at least      a dozen condoms   as he gets    more and\n     more frustrated      with   this  process.   Each time he fails,      he\n     tosses   the condom and the wrapper        on the floor   next   to him.\n\n     Finally     he    gets      one         on.\n\n                                                 ANDY\n                      There    you go.

knew we\nwere a fairly odd family.\nFirst there was me.\nToo tall. Too skinny.\nToo orange.\nMy mum was lovely,\nbut not like other mums.\nThere was\nsomething solid about her.\nSomething rectangular,\nbusy and unsentimental.\nHer fashion icon was the Queen.\nDad, well, he was more normal. He always\nseemed to have time on his hands.\nAfter giving up teaching university\nstudents on his 50th birthday,\nhe was eternally available\nfor a leisurely chat or\nto let me win at table tennis.\nYes.\nAnd then there was Mum's\nbrother, Uncle Desmond.\nAlways impeccably dressed. He\nspent the days just, well,\nbeing Uncle Desmond.\nHe was the most charming and least\nclever man you could ever meet.\nHis mind was on other things,\nthough we never found out what.\nAnd then,\nfinally there was Catherine.\nKatie. Kit Kat. My sister.\nIn a household of sensible jackets\nand haircuts there was this,\nwell, what can I call her,\nnature thing.\nWith her elfin eyes, her purple\nT-shirts and her eternally bare feet,\nshe was then,\nand still is to me,\nabout the most wonderful\nthing in the world.\nAll in all, it was a pretty good childhood.\nFull of repeated rhythms and patterns.\n\n\n                                 Page 2/61\n\nBy the time I was 21,\nwe were still\nhaving tea on the beach\nevery single day.\nSkimming stones and\neating sandwiches,\nsummer and winter,\nno matter what the weather.\nAnd every Friday evening,\na film,\nno matter what the weather.\nAnd then once a year, the\ndreaded New Year's Eve party.\nYeah, I might just get one.\nYou're absolutely gorgeous.\nI'm Katie. What am I drinking?\nThis is very expensive stuff.\nCheers. Cheers.\nCome on, it's nearly midnight.\nWe're all going through.\nWe're going through.\nLook, I've gotta find you a...\nGod!\nEveryone makes little mistakes.\nIt's fine. Come on.\n6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\nHappy New Year!\nHappy New Year.\nSorry.\nAnd so I woke up\nthe next morning,\nhung-over, ashamed of myself,\nand not realising\nit was the day\nthat would change\nmy life forever.\nGet up, stupid.\nDad wants you.\nHello. Sexy pyjamas.\nTim, come in.\nDo\nsit down.\nThat's very formal.\nWell, um, yeah.\n\n\n                                  Page 3/61\n\nThis is an odd moment for me\nbecause I had\nthe same moment with my\nfather when I'd just\nturned 21, and after it,\nmy life was never the same, so I\napproach it pretty, um, nervously.\nOkay.\nWhen you're ready.\nIt's all very mysterious.\nRight.\nTim, my dear son, the...\nThe simple fact is\nthe men in this family\nhave always had\nthe ability to...\nThis is going to sound strange,\nbe prepared for strangeness.\nGet ready for spooky time,\nbut there's this family secret.\nAnd the secret is that\nthe men in the family can\ntravel in time.\nWell, more accurately,\ntravel back in time.\nWe can't travel\ninto the future.\nThis is such a weird joke.\n?t's seriously not a joke.\nSo you're saying that you and\ngranddad, and his brothers\ncould all travel back in time?\nAbsolutely.\nAnd you still do? Absolutely.\nAlthough it's not as dramatic as it sounds.\nIt's only in my own life.\nI can only go to places where I\nactually was and can remember.\nI can't kill Hitler or shag\nHelen of Troy, unfortunately.\nOkay, stop.\nUm...\nif it's true, which it isn't.\nAlthough it is.\n\n\n                                 Page 4/61\n\nAlthough it isn't, obviously. But if\nit was, which it's not. Which it is.\nWhich it isn't.\nBut if it was, how would I...\nThe ?'How?' is\nthe easy bit, in fact.\nYou go into a dark place,\nbig cupboards are\nvery useful generally.\nToilets, at a pinch.\nThen you clench\nyour fists like this.\nThink of the moment\nyou're going to\nand you'll find yourself there.\nAfter a bit of a stumble\nand a rumble and a tumble.\nWow.\nIs as good a reaction as any.\nI think I plumped for ?'fuck!?'\nbut it was the '70s.\nNo, this is\nso obviously a joke.\n?t's not a joke.\nWhy would I lie to someone I'm\nfairly fond of?\nOkay.\nBut, when I come\nback downstairs\nafter standing in a cupboard\nwith my fists clenched,\nyou're gonna be\nin so much trouble.\nWell,\nlet's see, shall we?\nAnd, Tim, try and\ndo something interesting.\nSo much trouble.\nI mean it. Really.\nRight.\nWow!\nYou all right, Tim?\nYes. Yeah. Good, ace. Yeah.\nGood, come on. it's nearly\n\n\n                                 Page 5/61\n\nmidnight and we've got to find...\nWhoa, whoa, whoa!\nWhoo! Midnight.\n10, 9, 8, 7,\n6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\nHappy New Year!\nThank you, Tim.\nYou're welcome, Polly.\nDoes Mum know?\nNot a whistle.\nStrange. And what about the whole...\nButterfly effect thing. What can I say?\nWe don't seem to have\nmessed up civilisation yet.\n?t's gonna be\na complicated year.\n?t's gonna be\na complicated life.\nWhat have you\ndone with it?\nFor me,\nit's books, books, books.\nI've read everything\na man could wish to.\nTwice. Dickens three times.\nAny first thoughts?\nWell, I suppose apart from getting\na slightly better haircut... Yeah.\nMoney would be\nthe obvious thing.\nVery mixed blessing.\nUtterly screwed up\nyour grandfather's life.\nLeft him without\nlove or friends.\nI've never bumped into a\ngenuinely happy rich person.\n?t would be nice\nnot to have to work.\nNo, that's a real\nrecipe for disaster.\nLook what happened to Uncle Fred.\nWhat happened to Uncle Fred?\nAbsolutely sod all.\n\n\n                                 Page 6/61\n\nWasted his life.\nYou have to use it for\nthings that you really think\nwill make your life\nthe way you want it to be.\nCome on,\nreally think about this.\nWell,\nto be honest,\nI suppose, at the moment,\nit would be just great if it\ncould help me get a girlfriend.\nWow.\nMassive. Yeah.\nThe mothership.\nFor me, it was always\ngonna be about love.\nAnd that summer I walked\ninto the eye of the storm.\nHer name was Charlotte.\nCousin of Kit Kat's\nhandsome but\nnasty boyfriend Jimmy.\nAnd she was staying\nfor two whole months.\nJust one. Not both of them.\nTim,\nwill you do my back?\nAbsolutely!\nVery keen!\nWhoa! No. No.\nNo. No, no. No, no, no.\nIs it in my hair? Yes!\nTim. Will you do my back?\nSure. Just give us a sec.\nOkay.\nThank you.\nNow...\nOoh. Nice.\n?t's my area.\nit was a summer of\nsuntan and torture.\nI invited my foolish friend\nJay around for tennis\n\n\n                                  Page 7/61\n\nbecause I thought\nhe'd make me look good.\nI was wrong!\nWhat are you doing? No.\nCharlotte just made both\nof us look like idiots.\nBad luck, Tim.\nHow the hell are you meant\nto concentrate on your game?\nHow are you meant\nto live your life\nwith this sort of\nshit going down?\nIt never got better\nuntil suddenly\nit was almost too late.\nWell, Charlotte,\nour final lunch.\nNo!\nAnd it's been really, really\nlovely having you all summer.\nit has.\nThank you.\nThank you.\n?t really has.\nHasn't it, Desmond?\nBeg your pardon?\nLovely having\nCharlotte here all summer.\nCharlotte? Who's Charlotte?\nCome on, darling. Charlotte,\nsitting next to you.\nYes, of course. Of course.\nCharlotte. Hi.\nLovely to meet you.\nHave you enjoyed having\nCharlotte here all summer, Tim?\nYeah.\nThere goes August.\nI've introduced him to\nmost things, haven't I?\nYou did. You were\nmuch more sophisticated.\nIn a quiet way,\n\n\n                                  Page 8/61\n\nI like to think.\nCome in.\nCharlotte. Yeah!\nAs it's your last night,\ncan I ask you a question?\nYeah. Ask away.\nNo, wait.\n?t's not going to\nbe about love, is it?\nLove? What?\nWell, it's just that Kit Kat warned me that\nif you were to ever mention it, I should be\nvery firm with you and tell you\nyou must treat me\nlike your sister\nand not be stupid.\nOr have I just made\na total fool of myself\nand you were actually\ngoing to ask me for\nlate night last\nminute tennis tips?\nNo, it was the love thing.\nWell.\nThat's very sweet of you.\n?t's just a shame you\nleft it till the last night.\nYou should have tried creeping along\nthe corridor while we still had time.\nOkay, the ?'last night?'\nwas a bad idea?\nVery bad idea. it feels like an ever\nso slightly insulting afterthought.\n?'Last night?' was\nnever going to work.\nAll right. Good. I've got it.\nCome in.\nTim. Hi. Charlotte.\nHi. Sit down.\nI know you've\nprobably suspected this,\nbut over the last month I've fallen\ncompletely in love with you.\nNow obviously\n\n\n                                 Page 9/61\n\nthis was gonna happen\nbecause you're\na goddess with that face\nand that hair,\nbut even if you\ndidn't have a nice face,\nand even if you had\nabsolutely no hair\nbecause of some\nbizarre medical reason,\nI'd still adore you,\nand I...\nI just wondered whether, by any\nchance, you might share my feelings.\nWow.\nI tell you what.\nWhy don't we see\nhow the summer goes\nand then you ask me\nagain on my last night?\nYour last night? Yes.\nTry me on the last night. See\nwhat happens then, shall we?\n?t's exciting.\nRight.\nNo, it's a perfect plan. That's\nabsolutely perfect. Last night.\nLast night.\nThanks very much.\nNight-night, Timmy.\nBig lesson number one,\nall the time travel in the world\ncan't make someone love you.\nBye!\nSo the love of my life\njust drove away.\nAnd the very next day\nit was my turn to leave.\nThere you go. Don't\nspend it all at once.\nThanks.\nDon't call too often, your mother\ndoesn't like to be disturbed.\nOkay. Thanks.\n\n\n                                 Page 10/61\n\nI caught the train to London in\nsearch of a future and a girlfriend.\nI was staying in St John's\nWood, near Abbey Road,\nwith a playwright friend\nof my dad's called Harry.\nIt's always nice to have family connections\nwhen you're a new kid in town.\nWhat the fuck do you want?\nI'm James's son.\nWho?\nJames Lake. What about him?\nHe said you had a room.\nGo in there and wait.\nQuietly. I mean it,\ndon't make a sound.\nOr I'll kill you.\nI was actually having the first\ngood idea I've had for a decade\nwhen you rang on the doorbell.\nBut now it's gone.\nYou little shit.\nHow's your dad?\nWeird cock, I always thought.\nSomething weird about him.\nReally?\nYeah, I never really\nliked him, actually.\nYour mum still\nlook like Andy Warhol?\nWhat?\nThat, by the way, is my wife.\nNice.\nYeah, you wouldn't\nlike her at first.\nSarcastic cow.\nBut eventually\nyou'd realise that\nshe's the best human\nbeing in the world.\nWhich is why she\nleft me, of course.\nHere you go.\nTry not to make too much noise,\n\n\n                                 Page 11/61\n\nparticularly when having sex.\nNo chance of that.\nChrist,\ntwo losers in one house.\nThat is my daughter.\nHave sex with her if you like.\nApparently everyone else has.\nIt wasn't a hopeful\nset-up for romance.\nAnd work didn't help\non that score either.\nThe world of law seems to\nbe entirely full of men.\nHello. I'm Rory. Very pleased to meet you.\nA real thrill.\nWell, who knows, we might become,\nyou know, pals, et cetera.\nWho the hell are you? Tim Lake.\nWell, I hope you're\nbetter than this clown.\nCome on, Roger.\n?t's Rory, actually.\nI've been here\na year and a half.\nI'm just saying that to be nice.\nIt's two years actually.\nSo six lonely months went by\nand it was still just me and Harry.\nMe lawyer-ing every hour\nof the day and night.\nAnd him putting the finishing\ntouches to his new play.\nNo matter how many girls\nthere were in the world,\nI always seemed to\nend up with Rory.\nHello.\nUntil, out of the blue,\non a dodgy night out with dodgy\nJay, something miraculous happened.\nThe waiters are,\nwait for this,\nright, they're blind.\nYou're kidding me?\n\n\n                                 Page 12/61\n\nI'm kidding you not.\nNo, as bats.

Lead on, maestro.\nCan I have your right hand on\nmy right shoulder, please?\nAnd your friend hold on to your shoulder.\nThank you.\nMind the stairs and\nbe prepared because\nit's completely dark.\nOkay, gentlemen,\nif you don't mind,\nI can sit you here beside\nthese two young ladies.\nNo, no.\nSounds absolutely perfect!\nGod,\nyou sound very perky.\nI am. And very handsome.\nSomeone's there.\nHi. Hi. I'm Mary.\nI'm Tim. Mary's my\nmother's name, actually.\nDoes it suit her?

No.\nTwo, a fringe fetishist.\nI'm just Kate Moss's\nnumber one male fan.\nGod. Really?\nYeah. God, yeah.\nDo you agree that the magic\nof her lies in her history?\nThat the informality\nof her early shots\ncompared to this stuff\nso you just always know\nthat, despite the high\nfashion, she's still just\nthat cheeky normal\nnaked girl on the beach?\nCouldn't have put\nit better myself.\nThat's absolutely it.\nI agree with that profoundly.\nMilk?\nYes.\nSugar? No.\nBoyfriend?\nYes!\nNo. No, you don't\nhave a boyfriend.\nDo I not look like\nI'd have a boyfriend?\n\n\n                                 Page 21/61\n\nDo I look like I'd never\nget a boyfriend?

No.\nNo. Definitely not.\nCome on, then. More details about\nthis wonderful first meeting?\nOkay, okay.\n?t was, um, what... Joanna?\nJune 17th.\nAnd Jo was\nhaving a little party.\nA living hell from which\nRupert, thank God, rescued me.\nAnd where was\nthis terrible party?\nMy brothel of a flat.\nWhich is where, though? That's\n\n\n                                 Page 22/61\n\nthe question, isn't it.\nWhat are you, a detective?\nNo, sorry, I've just got\na very visual imagination.\nI like to imagine\nstuff completely.\n26 Courtfield Gardens,\n\nSW5.

I know this is forward but\nyour face tells me that you're finding\nthis party to be a living hell.\nSo, I just wondered\nif you might come\nand have a bite to\neat with me instead?\nRight now.\nI'm sorry?\nObviously, I should have\nthought this through more.\nLet's talk about Kate Moss.\nI love Kate Moss.\nI always think the key thing\nwith her is the history,\nyou know, the informality of her early\nshots compared to high fashion stuff\nso you always know that underneath\nshe's still just the same\ncheeky normal girl\nnaked on the beach.\nThe beach.\nI agree with you completely.\n?f we leave now then we can have,\nyou know, more than one starter.\nI love your eyes.\nAnd I love the rest\nof your face, too.\nMore than one starter?\n10 amazing starters.\nAfter you.

Okay,\nsmart-ass, what do you do?\nI am a lawyer.\nSort of. Sort of.\nThat's sexy.\nIs it?\nI mean, I think so.\nIn a suit, in a court, saving\npeople's lives. Kinda sexy.\nI guess it is. Although it's\nnot as sexy as reading.\nSitting there in an office,\nin a little chair reading.\nOkay, stop. Ooh!\nJust wait right there,\nmister, because\na lot of books get\nsubmitted to my publisher.\nSo it's an immense\nresponsibility.\nI bet it is.\nBut when you do normal reading,\nis it ruined because it's your job?\nYou know, like prostitutes?\nI always worry that when\nthey stop being prostitutes\nthat they can't\nenjoy sex any more.\nYou always worry about that?\nNo, I sometimes worry about it.\nGood. Okay.\nBecause someone who always worried\nabout that would be a bit of a worry.\nWhen you read a newspaper,\ndo you think,?'Forget this, it's work?'?\n\n\n                                 Page 25/61\n\nHave you interviewed\na lot of prostitutes?\nWhen you read a menu,\ndo you think,\n?'No, I'm not reading this,\nunless you pay me hard cash.?'\nHow many prostitutes will you need to\ntalk to before this issue is solved?\nAre you planning to head to\nEastern Europe and Thailand?\nUm...

House, car.\n?t makes perfect sense.\n?t's very logical.\nChrist.\nUm...\nKeys!\nI'm gonna go into the bedroom\nand put on my new pyjamas.\nRight.\nAnd then in a minute you can\ncome in and take them off.\n\n\n                                 Page 26/61\n\n?f you want to.\nOne minute.\nHi.\nGod.

Okay, okay.\nI'm\nsorry, I'm sorry.\nDo\nthey know I exist?\nYeah. I've mentioned something\nlike you, but nothing very specific.\nYeah, they're quite conservative,\nso maybe not those pants.\nOkay.

APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT         1\n\n    ANGLE ON apartment doorway. As it opens and an enormously\n    SWEET-FACED, ELDER WOMAN steps out, bungled up against the\n    cold -- turning back to call inside to the unseen love of\n    her long life.\n\n                        SWEET-FACED WOMAN\n              I'm just going to get some flowers,\n              dear. I'll be back in twenty\n              minutes. It's tulip season today.\n              I'm so happy.\n\n    And now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness\n    dissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that\n    quickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her\n    apartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated.\n\n    POV - MELVIN UDALL\n\n    in the hallway... Well past 50... unliked, unloved,\n    unsettling. A huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever\n    met. Right now all his considerable talent and strength is\n    totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the elevator\n    door he holds open.\n\n                        MELVIN\n              Come here, sweetheart... come on.\n\n                        ON DOG\n              Sniffing at a particular spot on\n              the hall carpeting. Melvin lets the\n              elevator door close and advances on\n              the mutt who has ignores him.\n\n                        MELVIN\n              Wanna go for a ride? Okay, sweetie?\n\n    The dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges\n    and picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog urine\n    squirts the hall wall for a second or two. The DOG sensing a\n    kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK.\n\n                        MELVIN\n                  (a malevolent tone)\n              You've pissed your last floor, you\n              dog-eared monkey.\n\n    The dog takes a snap at Melvin, but the man is much meaner\n    and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout shut with his\n    hand and reaches for the door of the garbage chute.\n\n                                                           2.\n\n\n                        MELVIN\n              I'll bet you wish you were some\n              sort of real dog now, huh? Don't\n              worry... this is New York. If you\n              can make it here, you can make it\n              anywhere, you know? You ugly,\n              smelly fuck.\n\n    And with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and lets\n    go. We hear a FADING SERIES of PLEADING "ANOOOOS" from the\n    DOG fade to nothingness... as another apartment door opens\n    emitting the loud sounds of a PARTY and SIMON NYE, early\n    30s. Simon has been born and raised with Gothic horror and\n    it's strange that what that stew of trauma has produced is a\n    gifted, decent man.\n\n2   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT         2\n\n    Frantic... he bolts into the hall... Melvin is just about to\n    enter his apartment.\n\n                        SIMON\n              Verdell!?!! Here, good doggie...\n\n    He notices Melvin at the far end of the hall.\n\n                        SIMON\n              Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!\n                  (as Melvin turns)\n              Have you seen Verdell?\n\n                        MELVIN\n              What's he look like?\n\n    Melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is\n    directly opposite Simon's.\n\n                        SIMON\n              My dog... you know... I mean my\n              little dog with the adorable\n              face... Don't you know what my dog\n              looks like?\n\n                        MELVIN\n              I got it. You're talking about your\n              dog. I thought that was the name of\n              the colored man I've been seeing in\n              the hall.\n\n    Simon looks O.S. -- and sees his black friend.\n\n                        SIMON\n              Which color was that?\n\n                                                       3.\n\n\n                    MELVIN\n          Like thick molasses, with one of\n          those wide noses perfect for\n          smelling trouble and prison food...\n\nSimon has had it.\n\n                    SIMON\n          Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.\n\n                    MELVIN\n              (not missing a beat)\n          How're you doing?\n\n                    SIMON\n          Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall.

Are we being\n          neighbors for now?\n\n                    SIMON\n              (to Frank)\n          Do you still think I was\n          exaggerating?\n\nFRANK can only smile.\n\n                    FRANK\n          Definitely a package you don't want\n          to open or touch.\n\n                    MELVIN\n          Hope you find him. I love that dog.\n\nSimon, terminally non-confrontational, still finds himself\ncompelled to turn back toward Melvin.\n\n                    SIMON\n              (directly)\n          You don't love anything, Mr. Udall.\n\nSimon closes his door leaving Melvin alone in the hallway.\n\n                                                              4.\n\n\n                        MELVIN\n              I love throwing your dog down the\n              garbage chute.\n\n3   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT                      3\n\n    Melvin locks and unlocks and locks his door, counting to\n    five with each lock. He turns the lights quickly on and off\n    and on five times and makes a straight-line towards his\n    bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens the\n    medicine chest.\n\n4   INT.

He unwraps one --\n    begins to wash -- discards it -- goes through the process\n    two more times.\n\n5   INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT                  5\n\n    A group of PARTY GOERS enters -- followed by a HANDYMAN\n    holding Verdell who looks and finds:\n\n                        SIMON\n              who looks up -- lights up -- and\n              tears up as he moves quickly toward\n              the group and his dog.\n\n                        SIMON\n              Thank the good Lord... wow... my\n              honey... where have you been?\n\n                        PARTY GOER\n                  (thinking the greeting's\n                   for him)\n              He always liked me.\n\n    As Simon goes past him to take the dog from the Handyman...\n    JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a laugh at the Party\n    Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love. As the others greet\n    Simon, Jackie directs the group inside. Jackie lingers,\n    looking on affectionately as Simon picks some awful, sticky\n    gunk from the dog's body... he puts Verdell down to reach\n    for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS in protest.\n\n                        SIMON\n              Just for a second, okay?\n\n    The DOG YAPS "no."

This\n              is what you live for, he said. Two\n              heads on a pillow where there is\n              only the safety of being with each\n              other. How, she wondered, could she\n              find such hope in the most shameful\n              part of her.'\n\n    He barely reacts as we hear a LOUD KNOCKING at he reads.\n\n                           SIMON (O.S.)\n              Mr. Udall.\n\n    But Melvin's into it.

His walk\n    is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the danger\n    without giving off the scent of its mounting fear. At times\n    he places his palms together and extends his arms cutting a\n    path through people.

As long as I switch\n          every time...\n\n                       HER MALE COMPANION\n          Wonderful.\n\n                    MELVIN\n          People who talk in metaphors can\n          shampoo my crotch.\n              (on their look)\n          Eat up.\n\nThey turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the waitress\nstation where two waitresses, LISA and CAROL, are talking.\n\n                    LISA\n          Pay me back next week.\n\n                    CAROL\n          I owe you. I told you today...\n          them's the rules. Oh, excuse me,\n          Melvin.\n\nShe puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out of\nthe way. He gulps at the contact (since no one else ever\ntouches him) but covers his self-consciousness.\n\n                    MELVIN\n          I'm starving.\n\n                    CAROL\n              (firmly to Lisa)\n          Will you please take it?\n\nMelvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with stealth,\nso that she must touch him again to get him out of the\nway...\n\n                    LISA\n          This way you take a cab home so you\n          have time to get ready for the\n          date.\n\n                    CAROL\n          "Ready" is not my problem.\n\n                                                      11.\n\n\nShe barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could read\nMelvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the date\ntalk. To Carol he is as harmless as furniture.\n\n                    CAROL\n              (to Melvin)\n          Go sit down. You know you're not\n          allowed back here... Spencer's\n          more excited about it than I am...\n          He says, "Mom, I promise not to get\n          a fever or couch during your date."\n\nThe other WAITRESSES and the SHORT ORDER COOK all go "awww."\n\n                    CAROL\n          I know. He's just the best.\n\n                    MELVIN\n          I've got Jews at my table.\n\n                    CAROL\n          It's not your table. It's the\n          place's table. Behave. This once,\n          you can sit at someone else's\n          station.\n\nThe two waitresses signal their protests.\n\n                    CAROL\n          Or you can just wait your turn...\n\nMelvin walks back into the restaurant proper... he hangs\nnear their table... his discomfort builds in this limbo...\nthen:\n\n                    MELVIN\n          How much more you got to eat? Your\n          appetite isn't as big as your\n          noses, is it?\n\n                    WOMAN\n          What?!!\n\n                    MAN\n              (to Woman)\n          Let's go --\n\nThe Woman starts to protest.\n\n                    MAN\n          Let's leave.

As he opens\nhis utensils.\n\n                    CAROL\n          Bryan says he doesn't care how long\n          you've been coming you ever act\n          like this again you're barred for\n          life. I'm gonna miss the\n          excitement, but I'll handle it.\n\nThere is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some ingredient\nof self-satisfaction -- that she is the only one in the\nplace who can handle him. She starts to clear the table.\n\n                    MELVIN\n          The table's fine if it had some\n          cholesterol on it. Two sausages,\n          six bacon strips, fries, three eggs\n          over easy and coffee.\n\n                    CAROL\n          You're gonna die soon with that\n          diet, you know that?\n\n                    MELVIN\n          We're all gonna die soon. I will.\n          You will. It sure sounds like your\n          son will.\n\n                    ON CAROL\n          Stunned. Some crazy street-freak\n          has slipped under her perfect guard\n          and momentarily devastated her.\n          Melvin senses that he's gone way\n          too far. He wipes his knife.\n\n                    CAROL\n          If you ever mention my son again,\n          you will never be able to eat here\n          again. Do you understand? Give me\n          some sign you understand or leave\n          now. Do you understand me...\n              (adds truthful label)\n          you crazy freak? Do you?!?\n\nA beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing\ndown.\n\n                    CAROL\n          Okay. I'll get your order.\n\nShe walks away. Melvin watches her, biting his lower lip. He\ntakes some napkins and cleans the table himself.\n\n                                                           13.\n\n\n10   INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                          10\n\n     She is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room\n     sofa. He is expertly into foreplay. She begins to make\n     noises as she responds... each time startling herself with\n     her own noise and trying to reign it in.\n\n     She's two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway --\n     the other -- functional mom so blown away by the emergence\n     of this sexy self that she laughs. The Young Man stops and\n     looks at her.\n\n                              YOUNG MAN\n                 What?\n\n                              CAROL\n                 I... I...      I don't know...   You\n                 got me.\n\n     His eyes try to burn into hers... She is getting excited but\n     doesn't know how to play it... He pushes one of the fingers\n     of the hand caressing her face toward her mouth... She\n     closes her teeth, his fingers attempt opening her mouth. She\n     stops him.\n\n                           CAROL\n                 Let me just do whatever I do by\n                 myself...

Things are getting wild when we hear from\n     the distance a child, SPENCER, CALLING and\n\n     COUGHING.\n\n                              CAROL\n                 Kissing...     kissing boys.

HALLWAY/BEVERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT                       11\n\n     Pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway...\n     she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her mother,\n     BEVERLY, is listening to music on headphones... she takes\n     them off when she sees Carol, then hears the cough.\n\n                         BEVERLY\n               I'm sorry. I was hearing just\n               everything you were doing so I put\n               these on to give you privacy.\n\n     Carol now goes into her son's room.\n\n12   INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - NIGHT                               12\n\n     The room is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights... two\n     drugstore de-humidifying filters, a nebulizer (breathing\n     contraption) a waste basket... a night stand filled with\n     medicine, a blood pressure kit... along with some stacks of\n     seven-year-old toys and a small TV wedged into the tiny\n     space.\n\n                            SPENCER\n               I'm sorry.\n\n                         CAROL\n               Don't be silly. How bad?\n\n                            SPENCER\n               Not bad.\n\n     Carol feels his head... that's okay. Then he coughs --\n     trying to suppress it... then a bigger cough... they each\n     know what that signals... She brings up a waste basket as\n     he throws up... she comforts him. He apologizes. She loves\n     him.\n\n13   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  13\n\n     As she re-enters. He is taking a cigarette from a pack.\n\n                         CAROL\n                   (a bit panicked)\n               You can't smoke... He can't take\n               smoke.\n\n     He palms the cigarette -- resumes making out -- his hand\n     squeezes her breast -- then he stops and looks at his hand.\n\n                                                           15.\n\n\n     She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he picked up while\n     feeling her and then notices him looking at her with extreme\n     distaste... She barks a laugh to cover her embarrassment\n     but speaks the truth.\n\n                            CAROL\n               Oh, God...     I don't even notice\n               anymore.\n\n     She crosses to the kitchen for a dishtowel.

Three young men bullshit near the\n     approach to the tunnel.\n\n                                                      16.\n\n\nTheir names are VINCENT, EVAN and DOUG, who is the oldest at\n28. Vincent is dopey and the most likeable of the gritty\nlittle trio.\n\n                    EVAN\n          Why is every customer surprised I\n          read books?\n\n                    DOUG\n              (amazed)\n          You read books?\n\n                    EVAN\n          Oh, wow! I know this guy! Look! He\n          even bought me dinner.\n\nThey all focus on a black BMW as it slows and stops in front\nof them. CARL checks them out carefully through the front\nwindow. He is talking on the speaker phone.\n\n                    CARL\n              (slightly exasperated)\n          Look, I just can't. I promised\n          Simon I'd find him a model.\n\n                    FRIEND (V.O.)\n              (on speaker phone,\n               flirting)\n          Carl, take me off the speaker. Did\n          I tell you that these are house\n          seats? C'mon, you could use a\n          break. Hello... Carl, are you\n          there... hello?\n\nSeeing the hustlers:\n\n                    CARL\n          .   ...

I need a pretty\n               face.\n\n     Carl beckons to Vincent who joins him, trying to conceal his\n     pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest.\n\n15   INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY                            15\n\n     There is a KNOCK at the door -- Simon crosses to answer. He\n     is more relaxed than we've seen him -- a man at peace\n     humming to his favorite music, talking to his dog who\n     scratches at the door. Simon opens the door to Vincent.\n\n                         SIMON\n               Sorry, I was out in the studio\n               doing some work and I forgot about\n               our appointment.\n\n     He leads the way back toward the studio -- chatting away --\n     unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him and\n     eyeing the expensive apartment.\n\n                         SIMON\n               I usually make such a big deal out\n               of picking models but Carl's so\n               thorough. I'll bet he drove you\n               nuts checking your references.\n\n     And he turns and sees the naked model.\n\n                         SIMON\n                   (taken aback)\n               This isn't a nude.\n\n     Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes.\n\n                         VINCENT\n               Just kidding around.\n                   (then mutters)\n               So much for love.\n\n16   INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO (MINUTES LATER)         16\n\n     Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the\n     increasingly uneasy Simon.\n\n                         SIMON\n               Exactly what is your previous\n               experience?\n\n                                                        18.\n\n\n                    VINCENT\n          How about that pose?\n              (sing-song)\n          This is not fun...\n              (then)\n          Give me some direction.\n\nVincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive. He\ntries not to show it.\n\n                    SIMON\n          Nothing. I just watch till\n          something strikes me. Do anything\n          you think of -- try different\n          thing. Until I say, "hold that\n          pose." Then just try and\n          comfortably hold it.\n\n                    VINCENT\n              (trying another space)\n          The fact that you haven't said,\n          "hold it" means I haven't done it\n          right... is that correct? I\n          haven't done it right?\n\n                    SIMON\n          No... Okay. What I do is watch and\n          wait for, um... You ever watch\n          someone who doesn't know you're\n          watching... an old woman on a bus,\n          kids going to school and you see\n          this flash come over them and you\n          know immediately that it has\n          nothing to do with anything\n          external -- that it's in respond to\n          a private thought they just had?\n          They are just sort of realer and\n          more alive. And when you notice it\n          so are you. If you look at someone\n          long enough, you discover their\n          humanity.\n\nVincent's slack-jawed expression changes. He feels an\nintellectual tingle to be having this conversation.\n\n                    VINCENT\n          I know exactly what you mean.\n\nThere's a joy in him at this moment -- a bit of purity.\n\n                     SIMON\n          Hold it.\n\n                                                           19.\n\n\n     Vincent does so -- hums a bit of "Satisfaction" to\n     celebrate.\n\n17   INT.

Leslie is telling the story of\n     the traumatic audition which may have turned her life. Carol\n     is rapt.\n\n     As they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give him\n     notice. Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so -- hard\n     not to be since he is giving a moment to moment commentary\n     on her every action.\n\n                         MELVIN\n               Clippity clop -- clippity clop --\n               she has to pretend she doesn't hear\n               me. Listening to the story from the\n               upset friend... now she drops off\n               the cappuccino and smiles at the\n               putzette who doesn't even say,\n               "Thank you." No, the putzette\n               wanted the whipped cream so back\n               she goes and now she has to pass\n               him again and it's getting tougher\n               to make believe.\n\n                         CAROL\n                   (reluctant forgiveness)\n               Okay.\n\n     Melvin stops -- she passes behind him to deliver an\n     uncharacteristic rabbit punch.\n\n                         CAROL\n               What's with the plastic picnic\n               ware?

I might be sort of done\n                  here...\n\n     Vincent quickly and expertly picks a CD to meet his\n     immediate needs and puts it on -- dying a little at every\n     second of silence during the transition... then LOUD MUSIC\n     PLAYS... Vincent even GOOSING the VOLUME.\n\n                                                              21.\n\n\n     Simon does a take -- he gestures Vincent to take it down --\n     which Vincent does.\n\n     ANGLE - APARTMENT\n\n     where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress --\n     Vincent's two friends from the street sweeping all objects\n     into large sacks -- one of them, Doug, pauses to look past\n     the terrace to the studio.\n\n                         DOUG\n               Lucky Vinnie -- he's a painting.\n\n19   INT.

Vincent is desperate to\n     distract.\n\n     CLOSE ON dog as Verdell awakens, stretches and pricks his\n     ears. He moves quickly to the closed door and starts to\n     frantically scratch, attracting Simon's attention.\n\n     As Simon keeps walking...   Vincent shoots over to the\n     canvas.\n\n                         VINCENT\n               Wait -- I want to see the painting.\n\n                         SIMON\n               Just a second -- he has to go.\n\n                         VINCENT\n               Please!! NO!!!\n\n     Simon opens the door and Verdell shoots out like a bullet.\n     Vincent pauses before the painting and is thrown to see his\n     humanity captured -- to be "immortalized."\n\n                                                           22.\n\n\n20   INT.

Cruising him?\n\n     And he uses the hat rack first as a spear, then as a club,\n     as the brief savage attack begins.\n\n                         ON VERDELL\n               as he starts to go toward Simon and\n               then scurries back in fear.

We STAY with\n     the dog during the O.S. dialogue: As his head turns in panic\n     we see his various POVs as the dialogue continues O.S.\n\n                         MELVIN (O.S.)\n               Hey, where are you going?

MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT           27\n\n     Verdell cringing as his new master approaches -- MUSIC\n     CONTINUES ominously. Melvin sets the bowl down and exits...\n     Verdell breathes excitedly though looking alternately in all\n     directions... his recent past making him suspect this feast\n     is a trick. He sniffs cautiously -- then dives in -- GOTHIC\n     MUSIC CHANGING on a dime TO SCORE his RAPTURE... from O.S.\n     we hear the sound of RUNNING WATER as steam escapes the\n     bathroom -- then MUSIC OUT -- as Melvin returns... ignoring\n     Verdell he sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly.\n     It's odd. Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the\n     bowl with his tail to Melvin. Then Melvin begins to play and\n     sing Monty Python's "Always Look On The Bright Side Of\n     Life," with its cheerful whistle refrain. Verdell looks over\n     with surprise and pleasure. But just as mood lifts and\n     warmth threatens, Melvin stops abruptly, turns out the\n     lights and exits.\n\n                                                           26.\n\n\n28   INT.

Enormous relief.\n     CHERYL, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his table\n     -- unseen by Melvin as he takes out his utensils and\n     arranges them.

Melvin, ever the shark\n               observer, looks from the cab to see\n               slices of community life -- MEN in\n               front of a bar, PARENTS giving\n               their CHILD a ride on a mechanical\n               horse outside a local store -- two\n               YOUNG WOMEN discuss dating.\n\n45   EXT.

That I wasn't there\n          to take crap from you and bring you\n          eggs? Do you have any control over\n          how creepy you allow yourself to\n          get?\n\n                    MELVIN\n          Yes, I do, as a matter of fact...\n          and to prove it I have not gotten\n          personal and you have. Why aren't\n          you at work? You're not sick -- you\n          don't look sick... just very tired\n          and bitter.\n\n                    CAROL\n          My son is sick, okay?\n\nEven saying the sentence, "My son is sick" pushes some\nemotions toward the surface which are wasted on the crazy\nman at her threshold.\n\n                    MELVIN\n          What about your mother?\n\n                    CAROL\n          How do you know about my mother?\n\n                    MELVIN\n          I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!\n\nShe crosses to the sink to dump the ice.

No, I am\n          a sarcastic person.

There is something sexy here, the\n     woman in Carol churning. She plops on a summer dress -- no\n     time for underwear.\n\n64   EXT.

NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT       69\n\n     As Carol passes Simon's door... stands in front of Melvin's\n     apartment -- twists herself to ease nervousness and knocks\n     on the door... then RINGS the BELL.

He gets up -- the first time we've seen\n     his waking routine -- taps one foot on the floor twice --\n     then the other foot -- two more taps and his body angles\n     from the bed in a deliberate way.\n\n     He is having anxiety.

You'd better start\n               finding something else to do with\n               your free time. If you can't feel\n               good about this break and step out\n               a little...\n                   (struts and pumps her\n                    arms)\n               You ought to get Mr. Udall to send\n               you over a psychiatrist.\n\n                          CAROL\n                   (more emotionally than\n                     she intended)\n               I don't need one 'cause I know\n               what's really going on here.

What?\n\nCarol is amazed at herself... that she might not be able to\nstem the flow... wide-eyed with apprehension, she looks at\nher mother, who, in return, only nods permission for Carol\nto let it go. A last defiant snort from Carol -- and then\nshe is overwhelmed. The headline comes first.\n\n                    CAROL\n          I don't know... It's very strange\n          not feeling that stupid panic thing\n          inside you all the time. Without\n          that you just start thinking about\n          yourself -- and what does that ever\n          get anybody. Today, on the bus\n          there was this adorable couple and\n          I felt myself giving them a dirty\n          look -- I had no idea everything\n          was...\n\n                      BEVERLY\n          Go ahead.\n\n                     CAROL\n               (great, forceful hand\n                gestures)\n          ... moving in the wrong\n          direction...

I was feeling like\n          really bad that Dr. Bettes is\n          married.\n               (this next one's tough)\n          Which is probably why I make poor\n          Spencer hug me more than he wants\n          to... Like the poor kid doesn't\n          have enough problems. He has to\n          make up for his mom not getting\n          any.\n               (weeps at her insight)\n          Oh, boy.

Why are you doing\n               this? Why are you picking at my\n               sores... What is it that you\n               want?... You want what? What's with\n               you? I hope getting me thinking of\n               everything that's wrong when all I\n               want is to not do this has some\n               purpose.\n                   (puffy; red; furious)\n               What is it, Mom?

CAROL'S APT, SPENCER'S ROOM, HALLWAY - NIGHT       75\n\n     As they enter, still wiping away the effects of their cry.\n\n                         CAROL\n                   (to Sean)\n               We're going out.\n\n                          SEAN\n                   (looking at their red\n                    eyes)\n               Looks like fun.\n\n     She kisses Spencer -- almost getting involved in what he's\n     doing -- then sees her mother waiting.\n\n                         CAROL\n               Okay -- we're out of here. I love\n               you.\n\n     Spencer nods -- involved with Sean. CAMERA FOLLOWS Carol as\n     she exits the apartment -- her mother leading. Halfway down\n     the stairs, she stops and reverses herself, going back to\n     the apartment which she re-enters -- then to her son to ask:\n\n                         CAROL\n               Do you love me?\n\n                                                              62.\n\n\n                         SPENCER\n               Uh-huh.\n\n     Carol exits.\n\n76   EXT. STREET - NEAR CAROL'S BLDG. (MOVING) - DAY            76\n\n     Beverly and Carol walking past the store windows.

CAROL'S RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON CAROL - DAY             77\n\n     As Carol stands nervously while Lisa finishes reading her\n     letter. In the b.g. Melvin and Frank are seated at the same\n     table and in earnest conversation. Lisa keeps flicking away\n     tears -- a few drops on the pages.\n\n                         CAROL\n               Don't get it wet.\n\n     Lisa brushes the paper -- finishes and embraces Carol.\n\n                         CAROL\n               So it's okay?\n\n                         LISA\n               You almost have me liking him.

Go ahead, Simon. Really. Please.\n          Don't let him stop you. Ignore him.\n\n                    SIMON\n          Okay. Well, one day my father came\n          in on one of those painting\n          sessions when I was nine -- and he\n          just started screaming at her -- at\n          us -- at evil. And...\n\n                     MELVIN\n              (very quickly)\n          ... my father didn't leave his room\n          for 11 years -- he hit my hand with\n          a yardstick if I made a mistake on\n          the piano.\n\n                    CAROL\n          Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked\n          in on you and was yelling and...\n          really, come on.\n\n                    SIMON\n          I was trying to defend my mother\n          and make peace, in the lamest way.\n          I said, "she's not naked -- it's\n          art." And then he started hitting\n          me. And he beat me unconscious.\n          After that he talked to me less and\n          less -- he knew before I left for\n          college, my dad came into my room.\n          He held out his hand. It was filled\n          with money. A big wad of sweaty\n          money.\n              (gathers himself)\n          And he said to me, "I don't want\n          you to ever come back." I grabbed\n          him and I hugged him... He turns\n          and walked out.\n\nCarol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as\nstrange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so much\nmore complicated than her meat and potatoes troubles. She\nlooks out her window -- then kisses her fingers and touches\nthem to Simon's cheek. A nice, understated, gesture of\nfriendship.\n\n                    CAROL\n          Well, you know -- I still stay what\n          I said.

Just\n               not anybody in this car. But lots\n               of people -- that's their story --\n               good times and noodle salad... and\n               that's what makes it hard.

It's not your\n          style. Okay... Here I goes...\n          Clearly a mistake.\n              (this is hell for him)\n          I have this -- what? Ailment... And\n          my doctor -- a shrink... who I used\n          to see all the time... he says 50\n          or 60 percent of the time a pill\n          can really help. I hate pills. Very\n          dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I\n          am using the word "hate" about\n          pills. My compliment is that when\n          you came to my house that time and\n          told me how you'd never -- well,\n          you were there, you know... The\n          next morning I started taking these\n          pills.\n\n                    CAROL\n              (a little confused)\n          I don't quite get how that's a\n          compliment for me.\n\nAmazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion -- so\nthat he uncharacteristically looks at her directly -- then:\n\n                    MELVIN\n          You make me want to be a better\n          man.\n\nCarol never expected the kind of praise which would so slip\nunder her guard. She stumbles a bit -- flattered,\nmomentarily moved and his for the taking.\n\n                    CAROL\n          That's maybe the best compliment of\n          my life.\n\n                                                      85.\n\n\n                    MELVIN\n          Then I've really overshot here\n          'cause I was aiming at just enough\n          to keep you from walking out.\n\nCarol laughs.\n\n                    CAROL\n          So how are you doing with those\n          pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.\n\n                    MELVIN\n          Takes months to know... They work\n          little by little.\n              (holds his head; then)\n          Talking like this is exhausting.\n\nCarol moves to the chair next to him... She sits very close -\n- he tenses.\n\n                    CAROL\n          Have you ever let a romantic moment\n          make you do something you know is\n          stupid?\n\n                    MELVIN\n          Never.\n\n                    CAROL\n          Here's the trouble with never.\n\n                    TIGHT SHOT\n          for the kiss. Their faces are close\n          -- she looks at him... She closes\n          her eyes -- her face moving toward\n          him -- he is wide-eyed and\n          afraid... His face almost moves\n          away -- in a shot this close it's\n          almost flight... But now his head\n          moves back and he receives her\n          kiss. It is brief. Carol smiles\n          encouragement to him and herself.\n          Melvin can't bear the pleasure.\n\n                    MELVIN\n          You don't owe me that.\n\n                    CAROL\n          That wasn't payment. When you first\n          came into breakfast, when I saw you\n          -- I thought you were handsome...\n          Then, of course, you spoke...\n\n                                                      86.\n\n\n          So now that your soft li'l\n          underbelly is all exposed. Tell me,\n          why did you bring me?\n\nMelvin's voice is soft -- hesitant, okay, vulnerable... as\nhe holds up his hands in a "stop" signal.\n\n                    MELVIN\n          Well, ah... that's a personal\n          question.\n\n                    CAROL\n          Tell me even if you're scared. Tell\n          me why you wanted me here. It's\n          okay.\n\nShe kisses him again.\n\n                    CAROL\n          If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."\n\n                    MELVIN\n              (dissembling)\n          There are lots of reason...

Look at\n          me! Is that really why you brought\n          me... Like I'm a what and I owe you\n          what?!\n\n                    MELVIN\n          I don't know why I brought you --\n          that idea occurred to me is all...\n          It came out first... Hey, you kiss\n          him -- me... He says he loves you.\n          You two hit it off. But you don't\n          want to... fine... Forget what I\n          said about sex with Simon. It was a\n          mistake.\n\n                    CAROL\n              (wiping away tears)\n          I'll never forget you said it.\n\n                                                            87.\n\n\n                          MELVIN\n                It was a mistake.\n\n      But she has already turned away and exits the restaurant...\n      Melvin alone and miserable.\n\n104   INT.

Let me sleep on it\n          and figure it out.\n              (then)\n          Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to\n          what I had... She's evicted me from\n          my life.\n\n                    SIMON\n          Did you like it that much?\n\n                    MELVIN\n              (furiously)\n          It was better than this... Look,\n          you, I'm very intelligent. If\n          you're going to give me advice or\n          conversation or consolation or\n          hope, you got to be better than\n          you're doing.\n\n                                                   101.\n\n\n          If you can't be at least\n          momentarily interesting than shut\n          the hell up.

I'll take\n          your seat any day. So do\n          something... don't sleep on it...\n          go over there. I don't think\n          anybody should ever sleep on\n          anything -- it's not always good to\n          let things calm down.\n\n                    MELVIN\n          Hey... I'm charged here.

I think you've\n          got a chance. The only real enemy\n          you have is her ability to think\n          logically -- the best thing you\n          have going for you is your\n          willingness to humiliate yourself\n          if it gives you one chance in\n          whatever -- so go catch her off-\n          guard.\n\n                    MELVIN\n          Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.\n\nHe moves for the door... stops suddenly, jolted.\n\n                    SIMON\n          What's wrong?\n\n                                                            102.\n\n\n                          MELVIN\n                I forgot to lock the door.\n\n123   EXT.

CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT     126\n\n      As Melvin gives up and starts out... turning as the sudden\n      blast of being BUZZED into Carol's life sounds.

And the\n          fact that I get it makes me feel\n          great... about me!\n\n                                                     107.\n\n\n              (a real question filled\n               with concern for her)\n          You got a real good reason to walk\n          out on that?\n\nThat last question clearly a true question, not the least\nrhetorical -- she considers her answer, then:\n\n                    CAROL\n          No! It's certainly not. No -- I\n          don't think so. No.\n\n                    MELVIN\n              (tentatively)\n          I'm gonna grab you.\n              (with conviction)\n          I didn't mean it to be a question.\n          I'm gonna grab you.\n\nHe kisses her. An awkward bomb of a kiss. They separate. A\ntense beat. Then:\n\n                    MELVIN\n          I know I can do better.\n\nThey embrace again. He does indeed do much better. A first-\nclass smooch. CAMERA MOVES DOWN to see his foot land\nsquarely on a crack in the sidewalk without his knowledge.\nThey break -- look at each other without a notion of where\nto take it from here, and the ALMOST in unison begin to walk\naway FROM CAMERA, Melvin following a path that avoids\ncracks. Suddenly the lights of the bakery turn on as it\nopens for business.\n\n                    CAROL\n          Warm rolls...\n\nThey walk to the bakery, Melvin avoiding the cracks. As they\nenter the bakery, a WORKER moves toward them to clean the\nentranceway.

hinted to the fact I wasn't making\nenough money.\nIf you can call, "Still making\nthe same salary, honey?" a hint.\nMy ex-wife used to say that too,\nbut she never used the word "honey."\n-In three years, can I double my income?\n-Good luck.\n-Four years?\n-Maybe.\nYou're great people\nand this is a great present.\nI wish I could squeeze all of you\ninto one pretty woman.\nIf you'd like to go into my office, I'll try.\nThanks a lot.\nI'll be home soon.\nI'm taking Daniel to get his new car.\n-What'd he get?\n-BMW convertible.\nOh, my God. Leather?\n-Leather?\n-Oh, yeah.\n-I want one.\n-All right. Kiss Alex for me.\n-I want one.\n-She says, "happy birthday."\nThese are great.

You lose weight?\n-Did I what?\nI was talking to someone else.\n-Did any lights come on the dash?\n-I don't think so.\nThat means you're okay.\nIf there's any trouble, they come on.\nWe have a saying around here.\n"If you smell something\nand don't see lights, try dry cleaning."\nTry what?\nShe has no sense of humor.\nDry cleaning?\nIf it smells on Monday, bring it in.\n-I'm sure it's nothing.\n-I'm sure it's something.\nTrouble with a new car?\nShe's a lunatic. Boy, you have lost\na lot of weight!\nA lot of weight?\nYou saw me three days ago.\n\n\n                                 Page 3/49\n\nYou look different.

Heaven?\nNo, it isn't heaven.\n-Is it hell?\n-No, it isn't hell either.\nActually, there is no hell. But I hear\nLos Angeles is getting pretty close.\nDaniel, let me tell you what's going on.\nWhen you're born into this universe,\nyou're in it for a long time.\nYou have many different lifetimes.\nAfter each one...\n...there's an examining period,\nwhich you're in now.\nEvery second of every lifetime\nis recorded...\n\n\n                                 Page 9/49\n\n...and as each one ends,\nwe sort of look at it.\nLook at a few of the days, examine it...\n...and if everyone agrees,\nyou move forward.\n-What do you mean "move forward"?\n-Continue onward.\nThe point of the whole thing is\nto keep getting smarter.\nTo keep growing...\n...to use as much of your brain as possible.\nI use 48 percent of my brain.\nHow much do you use?\nI'm sorry?\nI use 3 percent of my brain?\nDon't worry. Everybody on Earth\nuses 3 percent of their brain.\n3 to 5 percent.\nThat's why they're there.\n3? 3 percent?\nNo one on Earth uses more than that?\nWhen you use more than 5 percent\nyou don't want to be on Earth.\nThough your take-out places are lovely...\n...there are more exciting destinations\nfor smarter people.\nBeing from Earth as you are,\nand using as little of your brain as you do...\n...your life is devoted to dealing with fear.\nIt has?\nEverybody on Earth deals with fear.\nThat's what Little Brains do.\nWhat are "Little Brains"?\nThat's what we call you folks\nbehind your back.\nForgive me.\nWho are you?\nI'm just like you.\nI was on Earth a long time ago.\nBut I advanced, I moved forward.\nI got over my fears.\nAnd I got smarter.\nDid your friends' stomachs hurt?\n-Everyone of them.\n\n\n                                 Page 10/49\n\n-It's fear.\nFear is like a giant fog.\nIt blocks everything.\nReal feelings, true happiness, real joy.\nThey can't get through that fog.\nBut you lift it...\n...and you're in for the ride of your life.\nGod, my 3 percent is swimming.\n-What are you reading?\n-You wouldn't understand.\nJust numbers.\n-You read numbers?\n-Yes, sir.\nI'm on trial for being afraid?\nFirst, I don't like to call it a "trial."\nSecond, yes.\n-What happens if I'm guilty?\n-Don't think "innocent" or "guilty."\nWorse comes to worse,\nyou'll go back to Earth and try again.\nYou keep going back until you get it right?\nNot forever.\nEventually, they'll throw you away.\n-Have I been to Earth before?\n-Yeah.\n-How many times?\n-Approaching 20.\n-Is that a lot?\n-I was there six.\nMy God! So I'm the dunce of the Universe.\nWe've had people\nwho have been there 100 times.\nI wouldn't want them as friends,\nbut we've seen them.\nIf you're defending me,\nis there a prosecutor?\nDamn good one. Lena Foster.\nWe call her "The Dragon Lady."\nThat's our prosecutor?\n-Who does she work for?\n-The Universe.\nThe Universe is like a big machine,\nand we are parts.\nIf a bad part gets through\n\n\n                                 Page 11/49\n\nbefore it's ready...\n...the whole machine breaks down.\nWe're here to make sure you're ready.\n-What do they look at exactly?\n-I can't tell you that exactly.\nBut I can tell you\nit's nine days from your life.\nNine days.\nSo my trial goes on for nine days?\nNo. All the trials last four days.\nWe look at nine days, or episodes,\nfrom your life.\n-Tell me which days.\n-I'm not allowed.\nIs that a normal number? High? Low?\nls that a good number?\nYou're very concerned about normal.\nKind of cute.\nI'd prefer seven, but nine's fine.\nSome have twelve.\n-Hungry?\n-Starving. I didn't have time to eat.\nWell, Mr. All-You-Can-Eat, let's stuff.\nCome on.\nWe have about 400,000 residents here.\nWe service half of the US's dead.\nAbout 2,500 people a day.\nDo children come here?\nChildren don't have to defend themselves.\nWhen a child is taken,\nthey automatically move forward.\nIsn't that nice?\nAny teenagers?\nToo much trouble. They go elsewhere.\nWe tried, but they damaged the tupas.\nToo rowdy.\nHow is your chicken?\nDelicious.\n-What are you eating?\n-You wouldn't like this.\nWhat does it taste like?\nYou're curious, aren't you? I like that.\n-Want to try?\n-Yeah.

What's your name?\n-Arthur.\n-Hi, Arthur? Where were you from?\n-Denver.\n-Lovely city, Denver, Arthur.

After a while, I think\nit will become pleasurable to you.\nThey tell me it feels something like 3-D.\nAny questions, Mr. Miller?\nYou may begin.\nThank you, Your Honors.\nOver the following four days,\nI will attempt to show that Daniel Miller...\n...while he is a quality human being,\nis still held back...\n...by the fears that have plagued him...\n...lifetime after lifetime.\nI believe that I can show\nwithout a shadow of a doubt...\n...that he must once again be returned\nto Earth to work on this problem.\nMay we begin in childhood, please?\nCould we go to...\n...11-4-19?\nBy the way...\n...this signifies you're 11 years,\nfour months and 19 days old.\n-Is that clear?\n-I think so.\n\n\n                                 Page 20/49\n\nIn other words, if I said, 9-2-17...\n...you would be nine years,\ntwo months and 17 days old.\nI understand.\nRealistic, isn't it, Mr. Miller?\n-Look what I found.\n-Give me that.\nMake me.\nWhy don't you make me?\nYou can't make me\nbecause I'll beat the shit out of you.\nYou couldn't.\nHit him, Daniel!\nCome on!\nChicken! Hit me right here.\nCome on, chicken.\nHit him, Daniel!\nStick up for yourself, low-life chicken.\nThat's too bad.\nCome over to my house later\nand I'll help you glue it back together.\nWhat were you feeling as you watched\nthat episode?\nIt felt strange to watch myself.\nIs that what you mean?\nI mean emotionally.\nWhat kind of feelings did this bring up?\nFrustration?\nIt's not a test. There's no right answer.\nIs that what you felt?\nFrustration?\nI guess.\nWhy were you afraid?\nI object.\nHow did we introduce the word "afraid"?\nFrom frustration to "afraid"?\nThis is already pronouncing him guilty.\n-Could we use another word?\n-Which one?\nWhat word would I use?\nHow about "restraint"?\nI think the little boy was dignified.\n"Restraint"?\nMay I show you what I mean?\n\n\n                                 Page 21/49\n\nBe my guest.\nYour Honors, may we go to 1-8-17, please?\nWhat are you accusing me of?\nSay it to my face!\n-What?\n-You never think about my problems.\n-Lower your voice.\n-Lower my voice?\nDon't yell in front of the baby.\nIt's always the baby. What about me?\nI live here, too!\nI work hard to pay for this house!\n-I know you do!\n-The minute I earn it, you spend it!\nYou think I spend too much?\nAll I do is scrimp!\nIf you don't like it,\nthen why don't you leave?\nStop it! This happens when you drink!\nLecture time!\nJust sit down and join the lecture!\nDon't touch me!\nIn that brief moment,\nwhen that baby and his father's eyes met...\n...this child learned the meaning\nof restraint.\nHe wasn't afraid. He was mature.\nHe was non-violent. Dignified, I call it.\nMy colleague may believe in\n"Hit first, ask questions later"...\n...but we're not all that way.\nI resent that.\nLet's ask Mr. Miller. In the schoolyard,\ndid you want to hit that child back?\nI wanted to hit him back,\nbut I felt restraint.\nYou felt restraint. I see.\nIs restraint always\nthe best course of action in every case?\nNo.\nWouldn't this have been a case\nto not restrain yourself?\nIf you had stuck up for yourself...\n...this event would not have haunted you\n\n\n                                 Page 22/49\n\nall your life.\nYou never forgot this.\nYou always thought about it.\nHold on. People think about lots\nof things throughout their entire life.\nYou're isolating this incident?\nAren't we here to isolate incidents?\nOr maybe I don't understand the job.\nYour Honors, to save valuable time...\n...l submit 11-4-19 as shown\nwithout further comment.\nI'm fully satisfied. I love watching this kid.\nAnything you want to say?\nI feel very good about the "restraint" idea.\nThank you.\nYou're up.\nWhile we're still in childhood...\n...l'd like to show something\nabsolutely extraordinary.\nCould we go to 10-9-15, please?\nI'm on probation for stealing books.\nThey're going to think I stole this.\nI'll be expelled.\nYou won't.\nOf course, I will. I'm already in big trouble.\nGood afternoon.\nContinue working\non the assignment you began last Tuesday.\nTake these.\n-I'll say I lost mine.\n-You'll be in trouble.\nJust do it.\nWhere are your supplies?\n-I left them at home.\n-Left them?\nI lost them.\nDid you lose them or leave them?\nBoth. I left them and lost them.\nWhere are your supplies? Do you know\nhow much such these things cost?\n-Class, tell Daniel how much paint costs.\n-$10.\n-And the brushes?\n-$3.\n\n\n                                 Page 23/49\n\n-What's the total?\n-$13.\nYou can't be an artist without paint.\nLike you can't swim unless you get\nin the water. You must have paint.\nThis is careless behavior.\nI have to call your father today.\nSomehow, you must pay for this.\nYeah.\nYou got in quite a bit of trouble for that.\nBut you felt your friend would have been\npunished worse.\nAt 10 years old, he showed\nthe kind of courage most adults never find.\nI let the life stand for itself here.\nCould we go to 10-9-15?\nThe evening of that same day.\n-How will you pay for this?\n-I don't know!\nI'm very disappointed in you.\nI'm sorry.\n-We must punish you severely.\n-We don't have to!\nYes, we do.\nFirst of all, no television for a month.\nI didn't do it! Steve did! It's Steve's fault!\nWhat?\nSteve lost the paints.\nHe probably stole them.\nI didn't do it.\nPunish him!\nWhat happened to your friend Steve?\nDo you remember, Mr. Miller?\nWhat do you mean?\nHe was expelled from school\ntwo days later, isn't that right?\nI thought he left on his own.\nWhat's the point?\nI'm looking at the results\nof what you call a courageous act.\nMr. Miller might have acted bravely\nin class...\n...but we just watched him crumble\na few hours later, and why?\n\n\n                                 Page 24/49\n\nAt the threat of no television?\nI was ten years old. Television is\neverything to a ten-year-old.\nIt's like heroin. You can't just pull it away.\nI never wanted to watch.\nMy parents made me because they wanted\nto go out and I got hooked.\nMiss Foster and I\nhave had this argument before.\nI think the act itself is what's important.\nShe wants to keep enlarging it\nuntil everything loses meaning.\nIf I fixed a flat tire on your car and\ntwo years later I lose your garden hose...\n...according to you,\nI won't get credit for the flat.\nI'm just the dummy who lost the hose.\nLet me suggest this.\nDid we ever consider that\nthis boy had a bond with his father?\nIt had nothing to do with his friend.\nI just think Daniel couldn't lie to his dad.\nThat's all.\nYou're nodding, Mr. Miller.\nDoes that mean you agree?\nI had a bond with my father.\nI pretty much never lied to him.\nYou never lied to your father?\nWould you like to see\nat least 500 examples?\nI said, "pretty much."\nI didn't say, "never, ever lied."\nYou have to lie sometimes...\n...in an emergency.\nIt doesn't mean that the bond is affected.\nIf you've got the bond,\nthe bond's always there.\nEven if you lie sometimes,\nyou won't interfere with it.\nYou know, the bond can wait for a little lie.\nIn the end, it's there for you.\nSometimes in the middle of a lie...\n...l found that the bond would kick in.\nMaybe squeeze a little truth out.\n\n\n                                 Page 25/49\n\nWrap it up.\nI am through.\nVery good day. I'm pleased.\nShe's tough, isn't she?\nIf I told you how tough,\nyou wouldn't sleep, believe me.\nWell, I'm off. You call me if you need me.\nYou going out with that gal tonight?\nI can't. She's busy.\nBusy?\nI'll be damned.\n-How are you?\n-Fine. And you?\nSome sake.\nHow are you?\n-What's good?\n-Everything.\nEverything.\nWhat's this? It looks like a worm.\nOur resident food.\nHow does it taste?\nYou'd throw up.\nI'll have the tuna.\nVery good tuna.\nVery fast.\nSo I've been told.\nDelicious!\nLike it?\nThank you very much.\nHow many days?\nHow many days you looking at?\nNine.\nNine days?\nOh, my God! Nine days!\nYou better have more sake!\n9 days?\nI have 15.\nMy name's Frank.\nFifteen days?\n-Is that a lot?\n-I don't know.\nHow'd you die, Dan? May I call you Dan?\nI got hit by a bus.\n-And you?\n\n\n                                 Page 26/49\n\n-Got shot in the head.\nReally? Murder?\nHunting accident.\nSome putz thought I was an animal.\n-How'd you make a living?\n-Advertising.\n-And you?\n-Made a lot of money in adult books.\nSelling them?\nNo, reading them.\nYes, of course, selling them.\nWere you from LA?\n-Know the night clubs by the airport?\n-Those strip clubs?\nI coined the phrase, "All nude."\n-What do you mean?\n-That was mine.\nI bought two clubs.\nThey were only using the word "nude."\nI put up "Totally all nude."\nDoubled business in a month.\nI got to piss. You?\nThank you very much.\nI'm not leaving. I'm going to take a piss.\nTake a piss!\n-Hello.\n-Mr. Miller?\nI have a message for you.\nYou do?\nHere it comes.\nHi. Where are you?\nI'm going to sleep.\nTomorrow, when you're done...\n...meet me by the main entrance.\nI'll be there.\nI miss you. Isn't that funny?\nGood night.\nThis is wild.\nLet me get this straight. You actually\nhad sex with Benjamin Franklin?\nTwice.\nHow was he?\nHe was fat, Bob.\nI couldn't believe it.\n\n\n                                 Page 27/49\n\nIt's wonderful. I'd forgot all about it.\nHe was willing to sleep underwater.\nMarvelous.\nGood morning.\nGood morning. I'm Dick Stanley.\nI'm going to defend you today.\nI'm going to defend you today.\nMr. Diamond couldn't make it.\nHe couldn't make it? You're kidding.\nHe'll be back tomorrow.\nHow can you? You don't know me.\nMr. Miller, I use 51 percent of my brain.\nI know everything about you.\n51 percent? That's clocked?\nClocked.\nImpressive.\nI'll lose. I can't start over again with you.\nI operate differently than Diamond.\nWithout tooting my own horn,\nI'm quite good at this.\nI'm familiar with your life\nand I want you to trust me.\nI'll lose.\nThank you so much. That was so nice.\nIt was nothing.\nGood morning. Your Honor,\nmy defender is not here this morning.\nUnder the circumstances,\nthis puts me at a disadvantage.\nIt's quite common.\nMr. Stanley will do fine. Begin.\nToday I would like to begin\nwith an episode in the 24th year of life.\nMr. Miller had been out of school\nand working for several years...\n...and he had put aside $10,000...\n...specifically to invest.\nDo you remember?\nOne of Mr. Miller's good friends\nfrom school...\n...was the son of an executive\nof the Casio Corporation...\n...which at that time\nwas not doing particularly well.\n\n\n                                 Page 28/49\n\nMr. Miller had dinner with this friend...\n...at which he was given information...\n...which comes along maybe once\nevery five or six lifetimes.\nMay we go to 24-2-16, please?\nThey're gearing up now.\nThey'll start production in three months.\n-Buy as much stock as you can.\n-This is fantastic.\nSwitzerland keeps the time, Charles,\nnot Japan.\n-It'll change.\n-I doubt it.\nWhy not?\nBecause you need a society\nthat is into precision.\nJapan makes great radios,\nbut they don't know beans about precision.\nYou come here and tell me the Germans\nare going to start making watches...\n...and I'll invest.\nWhat's the present value?\n-Six.\n-Here's my prediction.\nWhen word hits the street, you're at three.\nYou watch. Remember who said it.\nFor the record...\n...Casio is one of the largest producers\nof time pieces in the universe.\nI know who they are.\nFor the record,\nhis original investment of $10,000...\n...would be worth $37.2 million today.\nWow!\nI have nothing further to say.\nI'm fine.\nYou're what?\nHe's not going to reply.\nYou aren't responding?\nI'd like to hear you speak.\nYou are good.\nListen, I'm not as smart as everyone here.\nAm I defective because\nI didn't make money on this?\n\n\n                                 Page 29/49\n\nI can't believe that the whole point\nof the universe is to make money.\nI can't believe that.\nThis has nothing to do with making money.\nIt's a judgment you made.\nNobody dragged you from home,\n\nsaying:\nYou chose to do that.\nYou sought the investment.\nWe're just looking at that choice.\nWhat did you finally invest in?\nDo you remember?\nI think it was cattle.\nCattle.\nWhat happened?\nI never got a straight answer.\nAll I know is, their teeth fell out.\nI rest.\nMr. Stanley, you're up.\nNo counter at this time.\nWait a second.\nYou're not showing something in my favor?\nNot at this time.\nI think it's better to move on.\n-Shall we move on?\n-Sure, let's move on.\nYour Honors, I would like to go to 29-4-5.\nThis is the evening\nbefore Mr. Miller took the advertising job...\n...he was to hold until his passing.\nHe asked his wife to help him\nby playing a little game.\nRemember?\nYou asked her to act the boss...\n...so you could practice\ngetting what you wanted.\n-Do this for me. It helps.\n-I'm eating.\nDo it.\n-What do you want me to do?\n-Be him.\n-This is silly.\n-It's not. It helps me.\n\n\n                                 Page 30/49\n\nOffer me $55,000.
