John 's body go limp . his vital sign flat . the paramedics record the time of death and cover the body with a sheet . they begin to assemble a gurney to wheel he out . deane ( annoyed to wallace ) what the hell happen ? wallace ( point to needle ) lindenmeyer develop neural connector that tap directly into the nervous system . if the simulator be not calibrate properly , experience death in this level of vr be like experience death within a dream . the experience become real . deane ( angrily ) simulation be suppose to give participant practice in realistic , dangerous scenario while protect they from the risk they be expose to in the real world . wallace ( annoyed , to lindenmeyer ) I be assure the problem be correct . lindenmeyer I do fix it .. I tell you I do . I do not know why it happen again . deane again ?! cox ( a beat ) my first two pair of convict suffer the same fate . deane ( coldly , to wallace ) why be not I tell ? wallace Black book dollar , black book operation . you pay I for result , not how for how I get you there . cox ( to deane ) I will tell you one thing -' there be no way in hell we should allow any real officer to train in this damn thing . deane then about all I have spend $ 37 million develop be a very expensive way to control the prison population . after give wallace a cold , hard stare -- namely at he hand stitched lapel , he gold watch , and he diamond - studd cufflink , she exit . wallace follow after she quickly . you now notice that the chair Dr. madison Carter have occupy be now empty . she leave a while ago .
