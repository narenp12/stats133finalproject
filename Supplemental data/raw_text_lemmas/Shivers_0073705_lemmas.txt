I have not hear that voice for so long . he tell I who it be , then he say something like , ' meet I at apartment 1208 at noon . I want you to go out for lunch with I . it 's time you further you education . ' then he laugh and hang up . I go back to sleep . he call I again at eight to remind I to come . detective how do he sound this time ? be he nervous ? depress ? ST . luc he sound fine . the telephone ring . the super , who have be fiddling with a window with a crack pane of glass , grab the phone instinctively without look at the detective , who probably would have answer it himself . super ( pause ) who ? no , that 's not I . you get the wrong guy . just a sec . ( look up at St. luc and hold out the phone to he ) it 's for you . somebody want to know how come you do not show up for lunch . the detective look suspiciously at St. luc , who simply look daze . int . rollo linsky' laboratory -- afternoon next to a shallow porcelain tray full of immense and grotesque marine worm specimen lie a large parcel wrap in brown paper . rollo 's plump finger eagerly open the package to reveal a large variety of delicatess sandwich and accessory . rollo offer some to St. luc while stuff one in he own mouth . there be coke and old coffee everywhere , plus mustard , relish , and ketchup dispenser of all kind . rollo and St. luc sit around rollo 's desk , a very sleek metal affair . rollo 's lab itself be a combination of modern office and biology room in a museum of natural history . specimen of all kind , in bottle and case , mount on glass and wood , float in preservative bath , be everywhere . there be also a few cage of live insect , moldy aquaria and lab culture in various stage of neglect . there be also clipping from magazine and newspaper sport furious underlining and circling in red ink which be stick to wall , door , bookshelve . despite the potential for chaos , however , there be a underlying order which reflect rollo 's own real discipline , which be not always immediately apparent . and the microscope and glass slide , the stainless - steel gynecological table complete with stirrup , metal drug and instrument cabinet , etc. , be spotless and in good shape . rollo be rotund , soft -face , and a manic-depressive . in he manic phase he be a joker and a elbow - nudger , and he general style , even when discuss medical matter in medical jargon , be broad North - american jewish . in he depressive phase , he become a sullen kid who have a oddly sinister aspect to he character . rollo detach himself from he baby beef in order to comment on the food that , not so secretly , he love best of all . rollo not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you , rog , but it 's all I get , and ... ( place hand on heart , lean over confidentially ) ... all I get I share with you . go ahead . take all you want . ST . luc you touch my spleen , rollo . ( they giggle at a old medical - school reference ) and here all the time I be think -- if I ever bother to think about the good old day -- well , at least there 's rollo . he 's in vd and he 's happy . rollo I be still a vd man under the skin , rog . you know I . I be a down - to- earth kinda guy , right ? ST . luc well , at least you still talk the same . rollo so who change ? ST . luc but you give up you private practice . suddenly you be into pure research and you ... you be what , a parasitologist ? rollo that be my father 's idea ... private practice . he want to set I up -- I could not say no . but he 's dead now . and I , I be still a snoop , I gotta do research . look at that beautiful stuff ... ( gesture everywhere ) ... lookit it ! he jam a final piece of sandwich into he mouth and jump to he foot , smile broadly . rollo ( with great enthusiasm , indicate the entire lab ) this be the ' satyr 's tongue ' ! he pull a book off a shelf with a bookmark in it . he open the book at the mark page and hand it to St. luc. as St. luc look at the picture of a satyr with he tongue hang out and read the brief note on how medieval alchemist think the ground - up tongue of the satyr could cure any disease , rollo continue to talk . rollo the note include a warning against swallow the tongue whole , but we do not see the rest of this caution . ' satyr 's tongue ' be Hobbes 's code name for we project . what we be try to do be to find a alternative to organ transplant . as rollo speak , he walk all over the place , pick up and discard various chart , specimen , bottled and disease human organ , etc . as he move around , we catch glimpsis of letrasetted sign that rollo have tack up : ' sex be the invention of a clever venereal disease -- Hobbes ' ; ' Dr. Hobbes 's prescription : starve a fever , feed a obsession ' ; ' the road of excess lead to knowledge ' ; plus several picture of satyr with they tongue stick out , be cut off by alchemist , etc . rollo I know . you be bored already . transplant be yesterday 's kishkas , right ? ST . luc ( shaking he head in protest ) do I say anything ? rollo ( excited , wave specimen of parasite and disease organ around ) look . you get man , you get parasite that live in , on , and around man . now . why not breed a parasite that do something useful ? eh ? why not breed a parasite capable of take over the function of any one of a bunch of human organ ? why not , for example , a parasite live in the human abdominal cavity that plug into the circulatory system and filter the blood like a kidney ? if it take a little blood for itself , so what ? be generous ! you can afford it . he be now in full flight . he lean over St. luc and begin to demonstrate what he say by draw thing on St. luc 's stomach with he finger . St. luc can not hide he amusement . rollo you put the bug into the body of a man with a disease kidney , the bug attack the bad kidney , dissolves it , it 's assimilate by the body , and now you get a perfectly good parasite where you use to have a rotten kidney . I know what you be gonna say . you be gonna say it 's crazy . ST. luc ( laugh ) it 's crazy . rollo throw himself back into he chair and grab a pickle . rollo right . it 's crazy . but here 's the beauty part . ready ? ( lean forward for emphasis ) who care ? ST . luc I do not get it . rollo you know and I know that Hobbes be a lousy teacher , eh? lousy . dry , academic , afraid of woman , lousy . but he be always a genius at one thing -- get grant . could he get grant for crazy project ? St. luc be about to say something , but rollo answer he own rhetorical question with a flip of the hand , effectively silencing St. luc . rollo you know who pay the rent here ? eh? the Northern hemisphere organ transplant Society . and that 's for something that 's suppose to put they outta business . and they be not the only one . we get grant money come out of we ear . he leap up again and pull a sheaf of reprint from medical journal like the Journal of venereal Disease , etc . he shove they under St. luc 's nose , then grab a jar with a disintegrate octopus - like creature in it and a sandwich at the same time . he smack down the sandwich in front of St. luc by mistake , then retrieve it and substitute the jar with the specimen . St. luc sift through the papers and glance at the specimen . as St. luc look at the papers , rollo breathes heavily down he neck and point out thing of interest . rollo see ? there ? you take a little of this ... that 's a very rare venereal disease you get in the nomadic crinua people , Northeast Asia and Japan . ( point to a sexy picture of a japanese lady in heat ) oo . that one 's get it bad . they call it batinh . that mean ' kiss ' or ' caress . ' when you get it it make you lip itchy , ya wanta kiss everything . I even have it once . I always get everything at least once so I know what the patient 's talk about . ( he laugh but he 's serious ) and there ... you take a little of that ... that 's beautiful , be not it ? that 's flexipes , the world 's only cephalopod parasite . ( indicate the jar ) that 's he right there . not a very good specimen . relate to squid and octopus . see ? he life in the gut of whale and big dolphin . ( wiggle a finger at the specimen ) ya like them big and hot and wet , do not ya ? yeah . he walk away from the desk . his manner be now more subdued and reflective . it seem as though everything he say provoke a dozen unspoken thought . his depressive phase be beginning . rollo we do not do it all here , we send out to have tricky stuff do ... the cell fusion , enucleation , chromosomal fission , all that fancy close work . rollo sigh heavily . St. luc gently shove all the papers aside . ST . luc rollo , how come Hobbes kill himself ? rollo toy with the gynecological examination table , slide the stirrup in and out on they adjustment bar . rollo ( shrugging ) funny in the head . High suicide rate in the medical profession . too much body , alla time body , body . he now get close to St. luc , put a arm around he shoulder . rollo rog , I gotta talk serious to you . really . listen . ya listen ? ok . I want you to come into this with I . to tell the honest - to - God truth , I be lonely . ( begin to pace around again ) all Hobbes ever do be run around get money and phone I in the middle of the night . he want you in anyway . that 's why we be gonna get together , the three of we . we would have enough to keep we go for at least five year , even with inflation . ST . luc ( a bit uncomfortable be put on the spot ) rollo , you know I . once a gp , always a gp . rollo ( almost angrily ) you want to help sick people for the rest of you life ? God forbid I should talk you out of it . ST . luc you oughta be careful yourself . might end up cut you throat . rollo it be woman do it to Hobbes . could not handle they . that girl , that annabelle -- talk about crazy project .

( indicate the gynecological table ) they use to come here sometimes . ( shake he head ) do not ask . he start to run down like a spring - wound toy at the end of its run . he glance at a picture of annabelle stick in a corner , which St. luc just notice for the first time . rollo I will never really understand how he could do what he do to she . St. luc look at he watch and get up out of he chair for the first time . ST . luc well , rollo linsky ... I gotta go open up the store . it 's be great to see you again . he move toward the door . rollo trail after he , head down , obviously deject . rollo yeah , sure . they shake hand .

'a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal disease , a modern version of the satyr 's tongue . ' rollo pause and flip to a new note with the head annabelle underline in red : ' she be become a new creature before my eye . it be like live at the Dawn of creation .

I dunno . but if you see some people do kind of compulsive , maybe even bizarre sexual thing ... ST. luc ( v.o. ) ( laugh : he do not take this aspect too seriously ) yeah ? what do I do then ? rollo I dunno . try tranquilizers . once you can get at they , there 's a lotta stuff you can use .

Nicholas tudor ? be that you ? tudor ? mind if I have a look at you ? he stand at the edge of the bed , peer at tudor , look for sign of consciousness . after a pause , he kneel on the bed and slowly draw back the cover . rollo just a peek , ok ? a little peek will not hurt . tudor 's abdomen be gradually expose as the cover be draw back . crouched in the shadow be one of the freshly emerge blood parasite , which sit poise for only a fraction of a second before it spring at rollo 's face with great energy . as the thing hit rollo 's face it lock on to he head by entangle its stubby tentacles in he hair and attach its sucker to he cheek and chin . rollo try to stand , then stagger and fall . the thing try to force its way into rollo 's mouth , cut he lip in the process . they bleed furiously . when rollo manage to pull a sucker away , a piece of he flesh come with it . as he writhes on the carpete floor , two more parasite appear crawl toward he from under the bed , cover with dust from the floor . they clamber on to he and fasten on to he face , sucker on to he ear , he throat , forehead , eyelid . one of they begin to ooze corrosive fluid on to he face . rollo scream in pain . he manage to roll to he foot . he stagger out of the darkness of the bedroom into the live room , one arm extend , grop like a blind man , the three parasite still lock on to he face . they try to pull he lip apart , but he keep he tooth firmly clench to keep they from force they way into the depth of he body . he take a few unbalance step toward the kitchen . with a sudden spasm of pain , he hurl himself sideways into the kitchen and almost fall again , grab at the last moment on to the sink . his hand touch a large pair of plier , a screwdriver , and a hammer on the counter by the sink , leave there by tudor week ago . rollo seize the plier and begin to pull the parasite from he face with they steel jaw . the parasite , swollen with tudor 's blood , burst and spurt as the plier tear they apart . in the bedroom , tudor 's eye snap open . his head rise from the pillow . he swing he leg over the side of the bed and , ashen and gaunt , shake he head slowly as though waking from a dream . he begin to mumble . tudor no , no , no , no . must not , must not . you must not kill they , no , no , no . then , as though listen to himself and suddenly understanding what he be say , he rise to he foot shakily and walk to the kitchen . he stop at the kitchen door . rollo have tear the parasite from he face and be pound away at they in the kitchen sink . the parasite wriggle and curl in they own blood in the sink as he smashes away at they with the plier . tudor stagger toward rollo . tudor no , no . you must not kill they . that 's my blood you be spilling ! my blood ! let they come home , let they come home , home , home inside I . do not kill they ...! he start to paw rollo , feebly try to prevent he from further mutilate the parasite . he reach over St. luc 's shoulder and grab a large chunk of one of the parasite . tudor ( whining pitifully ) at least save I one ! for God 's sake ! at least save I one . one , one , one , one ... rollo turn as tudor begin to shove the piece of flesh back down he throat . as rollo turn we see that bit of tentacles and sucker be still attach to he cheek , throat , forehead . his face be melting and smoking in area where it have be burn by the corrosive fluid on one side . he stare in rage at tudor . with a scream , rollo strike tudor with the plier . tudor fall , hit he head on various chair and protrude corner as he go down , the chunk of parasite still in he mouth as he finally come to rest , twitching , on the floor . rollo drop the plier on the floor . he stare at tudor in shock . his face be reflect in a copper fry pan hang over the stove . notice the reflection , rollo lean over to get close to he own horrible image . he gingerly touch he face , inspect the damage , shiver and moan . still shaking , he turn to leave . without warning , tudor leap up at rollo with insane energy and bowl he over , plier in hand . sitting on rollo 's chest , tudor smashes away at rollo 's face and head with the plier , the piece of dead parasite in he mouth drop on to rollo 's face as he drool . int . gym -- night forsythe finally open she eye . she smile at St. luc , who hover anxiously over she as she lie on the gym mat . ST . luc can you walk ? I could not find anything wrong with you . forsythe nod and manage to sit up with St. luc 's help . once she seem able to stay propped up without St. luc 's help , he get up and begin to move the barricade away from the door . ST . luc rollo and the police should be here by now . it 's just a question of avoid infect resident until we find they . St. luc come back to forsythe and kneel beside she . st.luc ok ? ready to go ? forsythe put she arm around St. luc 's neck as though want support . instead , she draw he down toward she and begin to babble in a strange , casual , dreamy way . forsythe sometimes I have a recurrent dream . have I ever tell you about it , darling ? I guess you could call it a freudian dream , because in this dream I find myself make love to sigmund Freud . but I be have trouble because he 's old and die , and he smell bad and I find he repulsive . and then he tell I that everything be erotic , everything be sexual , you know what I mean ? he have a very thick accent , but I can understand he perfectly . he tell I that even old flesh be erotic flesh , that disease be the love of two alien kind of creature for each other , that die be a act of eroticism , that even chemical combine out of sexual frenzy and long . that breathe be sexual , that talk be sexual , that just to physically exist be sexual ... and I believe he , and we make love beautifully ... while she talk , forsythe gradually slip she arm around St. luc 's neck and bring she lip closer and closer to he . St. luc , mesmerize by the hypnotic drine of she word , be about to kiss she . suddenly she mouth snap open wide with mechanical precision , she head tilt back , she eye flick close . St. luc stare at she in horror as she throat begin to swell . in the depth of forsythe 's mouth two parasite tentacles probe about , seek a firm hold for they sucker so that they can pull the parasite 's body out of she narrow esophagus . St. luc hesitates only for a instant , then rip a strip from she blouse , ball it up , and shove it into she mouth . holding she while she struggle to remove it , he rip off a second strip and tie it around she head to keep the gag in . St. luc rise , throw forsythe over he shoulder and begin to step toward the door of the gym . dangle over St. luc 's shoulder , forsythe struggle , moan , and howl as best she can . St. luc manage to pin she hand to she side so that she can not pull the gag out . before St. luc reach the door , a handsome middle - age woman peek in around the corner . woman ( croon in reply to forsythe 's howl ) hellooooo ? oooooo ? be there anyone here who 's all alooooooooone ? St. luc rush at the woman , knock she over . she roll on the floor , hugging herself and croon . once out the door , St. luc make for the nearest exit . int . stairwell -- night as St. luc begin to ascend the stair , we can see tiny black hook tear through forsythe 's gag . blood begin to soak through from the inside . a group of resident suddenly appear at the next landing above St. luc and , notice they , begin to walk down the step , moan and croon and make vaguely sexual gesture toward the pair . blood be now pour from forsythe 's mouth and tentacles be grop for leverage at she cheek and chin . St. luc decide to attempt to shoulder he way up the stair , certain that rollo and the police must be at the main door . as he hit the resident on the stair , they try to kiss he , caress he , pull he clothes off . they finally manage to drag forsythe from he shoulder , almost unbalance he as they do so . St. luc try to prop she up on she foot , but she 's completely limp . St. luc hold forsythe against the stairway wall as resident mill all about they . he look at she in sudden hopelessness . ST. luc ( shouting ) forsythe ! forsythe ! the parasite be now half out of she mouth , hang through the slit it have tear in she gag . St. luc let go of forsythe and she sink to the floor . the resident be swarm all over they . St. luc abandon forsythe and begin to fight he way up the stair . he run higher and higher , up flight after flight of stair , until he be free of the slow - move resident . he lean back against a wall , panting . croon and moan echo up to he from below . he lean over the railing and look down . in the stairwell several flight below , forsythe lie surround by milling resident , leg spread as though about to give birth . a resident lean over and pull the parasite from she mouth , then swallow it whole with gusto . other resident touch she , stroke she , caress she , as though offer she a strange kind of comfort . St. luc reel with disgust and disbelief . he turn and run . int . swimming pool -- night between the two tower lie the swim pool . St. luc manage to reach the door lead from the South Tower into the pool . he hang on to the door of the pool itself for a moment in near exhaustion , then open it and enter . the pool be dim and tranquil . two woman be swim in the deep end as though nothing be at all abnormal . St. luc watch they for a moment , enjoy the apparent normalcy of the scene . then he stagger forward , call out to the swimmer . ST . luc have you see the police ? I be Dr. St. luc . have you see the police ? have they come ? the swimmer both flick playfully beneath the water 's surface . St. luc approach the water 's edge , wait for they to surface . the water ripple and bubbles near he foot . a sink feel come over he . he watch in horrible fascination . he begin to shiver . the ripple and bubbles spread and intensify . after a pause , janine surface , smile radiantly . a few second later , bett surface near she , the very picture of benign , watery calm . bett gesture to St. luc to join they in the pool . St. luc shake he head slowly , back away from the pool . he turn to leave the room . as he turn , Mr. spergazzi appear out of the shadow behind he . use he four-pronged aluminum cane , he push St. luc backwards into the pool , chuckle playfully . spergazzi look around for approval as St. luc begin to thrash about wildly . bett swim up beside St. luc , grab he , and hold he under . bett ( to janine ) a kiss ! ( laughter echoe in the pool room ) give he a kiss . give he a kiss . various resident ( voice echoing in unison ) a kiss , a kiss , a kiss ! bett allow St. luc to rise to the surface as a laugh janine splashes over to he and fasten she mouth to he . as they kiss , janine 's hand hold St. luc 's head fiercely . bett assist she by pin St. luc 's arm behind he . janine 's throat ripple and swell , she cheek billow as a parasite swarm upwards from deep within she body . St. luc 's cheek now swell as the parasite enter he mouth . his eye jolt open in terror and he manage to pull away slightly , revealing the tentacles join she mouth to he like grapple iron . St. luc twist out of bett ' grasp . he and janine , still lock together , sink beneath the surface . dozen of resident pour into the pool room and join spergazzi and the other at the poolside . among this be face already familiar to we : kurt , kresimir and benda , the old laundry - room woman , etc . the new spectator clap , laugh , croon , and moan as though witness a wild group baptism . some of they throw themselves into the water , pull other in with they . deep under the water 's surface , St. luc still struggle to free himself from janine . resident now splash into the depth all around they . St. luc 's cheek bulge wide and blood dribble from he nose and mouth . his throat swell monstrously . janine release he just in time for we to see the end of a tentacle slip back into he mouth . he exhales heavily as parasite enzyme pump furiously through he body . the water boil with he exhale breath . janine and St. luc drift apart , now completely calm , as resident splash and swim , kick and embrace . int . starliner tower underground garage -- night the vast and dimly light garage be full of silent car . somewhere a engine start up , then another and another , until the whole garage be full of fume and the revving of engine . as we prowl amongst the car we find many of the resident we already know , now dress to the tooth in they seductive best . Mr. spergazzi and he wife stand and watch the spectacle , cane in hand , with great dignity . with they stand other who be too old or too young to go into the night look for new host for they parasite , content to remain incubator for the time be . the resident be full of bubbly anticipation in they car . kresimir lean out of he car and shout to no one in particular . kresimir ( shouting ) nobody should be alone ! nobody should be alone tonight ! the rest of the resident pick up the cry and chant together . resident ( together ) nobody alone ! nobody alone ! the night watchman stand near the garage door . smiling broadly , he stamp on the cable which activate the slide door . ext . starliner tower -- night the garage door slide open . one car surge up the ramp ahead of all the other , stop at the top . the driver of this first car be St. luc , sleek and exuberant , a raise collar and a scarf hide most of he scar . he glance into he rear-view mirror . in the rear-view mirror , St. luc see all the other car lining up behind he , light blaze . St. luc smile , then step on the accelerator . his car shoot out into the street . as St. luc 's car turn on to the street , car after car follow he . we rise higher and higher above the starliner tower apartment complex until the car be a small stream of light far below , bleed into the main body of the neon-lit metropolis . the end
