James stand in front of the coffee table , on top of which be a massive fold - out poster board , feature illustration of brigsby and a complicated flow chart with graph and text . jame ( mid-explanation ) ... the trick be , basically , brigsby have to find all the sacred artifact . the sortis crystal , arielle 's amulet , then ... he unfold another section of the presentation board -- a black hole surround by incomprehensible figure . ..- you just have to finda collapse star in a unclaim system ... he turn to the couch , he audience : ted and april . 5as . pleasant , square parent , listen politely . easier say than do , I know , but -- the poster board wobble and fall .

Ted and April share a look . dinner table - minute later Ted and April on one side , James on the other . plain pasta steaming . jame so , what do everyone think ? april private avowal first ... James nod . they fold they hand , look down , and mumble incoherently under breath -- a prayer ? but no one 's in sync . then , they word converge : jame / ted / april ..- and may we mind be stronger tomorrow . to finish it off , they stand and exchange formal handshake . jame ( sit back down ) I know there 's still some thing I need to add before I post it , so ... James trail off , sense something in they expression . what be it ? April nod to Ted : say something . Ted slurp he pasta , chew , swallow , clear he throat . ted well , pal . it 's clear a lot of imagination go into it . but the thing be ... I just do not know if any of this be plausible within brigsby 's universe . James take the note . consider it . I mean , you have he use arielle 's amulet against Sun snatcher ? sure , it 's powerful -- it be create by the drumbas -- but , if I remember correctly , it 's also very unstable ... jame yes , but not if you can fold space - time , that 's -- ( frustrated ) I should have explain , that 's why brigsby need arielle 's amulet , so -- april James . he pause , look up at she . april ( gentler ) what you father 's try to say be : we be proud of how smart and talented you be . ( more ) april ( cont 'd ) but all this time you have be spend on the brigsby website , and you project -- we just do not see the point . jame the point ...? James think ... it 's so self - evident it 's hard to articulate . ted well , I have hear it 's start to take some pretty unique narrative risk . april Ted , we talk about this . jame I just ... we all want to know what 's go to happen , in the end . april which be fine , as a distraction , every once in a while . that we could understand ; it 's healthy . but we can not have thing like this -- she hold up a hand - make poster : first ever brigsby bear fan meet -up ! !!! feature : James , brigsbyfanl , brigsbyfan2 and brigsbygirl where : James 's house James take it and fold it up , defensive . jame it 's just a idea ... april well , it 's not realistic . you could be use this time and energy to further you study , or solve the vansmithe conjecture -- she gesture to a equation on a nearby chalkboard : ax = ax jame I try already ... april and we will keep try . jame but it 's impossible ! and it 's stupid ... ted temper , James ... jame I know , sorry . it 's not stupid ... ( mumble to himself ) ..- but there 's no variant subspace parameter , so even if you want to it would be impossible , plus I do not see you blockhead solving it ... april we can hear everything you be say , James . my point be , we have come so far , work together . and now we be close to a real breakthrough . ( a beat ) which be why , for a little while , we be go to take a break from brigsby . James expression fall , indignant . jame what ?! april you can watch once a week . James share a desperate look with Ted . ted well , maybe that 's a little harsh ... what about twice ? once to revisit old episode , and once when the new tape come in ? april ( frustrated ) Ted , we have discuss this . once . and that 's that . April unfold she napkin , ready utensil . do not let you noodle get cold . but James just twist they in he fork . jame ( mumble again ) do not even look like food , more like the ransack of shabala ...

James and Ted walk to the end of the pier , where it balloon into a larger glass dome , like a undersea observatory . they take a seat on a bench , look out upon -- a SMALL oasis a few yard ahead : a pond , half surround by shoulder - high palm tree and houseplant in oddly dark soil . also , as Ted point out -- ted they sure come out tonight , huh ? 10 . -- there be several luminescent insect graze and glow around the edge of the water . or rather , they look like insect , but be clearly animatronic . similarly , a fox -like creature stand further away , move its head up and down . ted so , what 's on you mind , pal ? jame I do not know ... I guess , just ... someone out there be make brigsby , right ? and other people , just like we -- we be all watch it , together . it mean something . Ted put he arm around James 's shoulder . ted look at the grazerbug , James . all they need in this world be fresh water and cold moonlight to charge they rectoskeleton . they be here every night , survive , just like we . the difference be , we have dream and imagination , to help we escape . and no one can take that away from you , ever . as James think about that , one of the grazerbug short out . jame 's bedroom - night James look around at all he brigsby stuff ... ted ( 0.s. ) night , James ! power down ! the light flicker and fade . darkness . then , a small flashlight click on .
