Randy and hubertus be walk down a street in the old part of town . hubertus the man you choose for the arbitration panel be a safe bet .. but I be a little worried about the other two , I can not lie . the one choose by the austrian State be a strict traditionalist . I can not see he decide in you favour . and as for the third .. well , it 's a gamble . randy here 's hope . hubertus but I never think you have come back . and personally , I need to be honest - I do not think it 's the right decision . you be betting on Austria have change . and hubertus 's eye suggest that it might be a bet too far . they pass by a small concert hall . a poster catch Randy 's eye : there 's a Arnold schoenberg concert start in twenty minute . he look at hubertus and they smile at the coincidence . Randy check he watch and run to the box office , give he credit card to the female BOX office employee , who take it . randy two ticket , please . BOX office employee it start in two minute . and then she notice the name on the card . BOX office employee ( cont â€™d ) you have the same name as the composer . 106 hubertus look at Randy and they smile to each other . hubertus what a coincidence . int . concert hall . night . Randy and hubertus sit in the darken concert hall . Randy listen proudly to he grandfather 's music , watch the orchestra play and the crowd appreciate it . and something be inspire in he . int . the arbitration room . day . the arbitration . a large room in a government building in Vienna . at a long table sit the three arbitrator . in the room there be also a sizeable audience which include hubertus , Elizabeth gehrer , wran and Toman . Randy stand near the panel . one of the arbitrator stand . arbitrator the austrian government have provide its case in write for we perusal . Mr. schoenberg , you too be offer the opportunity to do so but you have opt to present the introductory point of you argument orally as well , be that correct ? randy I have , yes . arbitrator the floor be yours . randy thank you sir . Randy stand in the centre of the room and it feel like the whole of Austria be he audience . he clear he throat , take a deep breath but look uncertain - almost as if he can not do it . he begin but he tone lack confidence , it waver . randy ( cont 'd ) lady and gentleman , I be happy to be stand before you today for two reason . firstly , like my opponent in this case I always believe that this be a domestic matter for Austria that need to be decide within she border . suddenly he 's interrupt : a door open at the back of the room . his eye be draw to it . it 's Maria . she 's come after all . she walk up to the front of the room and sit . Randy come to she , lean in , and they whisper to each other . randy ( cont 'd ) I be not expect to see you here . 107 maria the first time I come back for myself . this time I come back for you . now , stand up straight . he look at she , take strength from she word , straighten up , and resume he open speech - she have move and inspire he . he take a deep breath and he look two inch taller . and the speech be now drive by a new confidence . randy and the second reason I be happy to be in Vienna today be because my client Mrs. altmann and I be both austrian . some of the audience seem surprised but Maria know what he mean . randy ( cont 'd ) oh , do not get I wrong , we be very much Americans too . but we family and the root we share be situate in the culture of this very city . int . concert hall , vienna . night . and we see a flashback to the night before and Randy observe the audience as they listen to he grandfather 's music int . klimt 's studio . day . and now we see Adele be paint by klimt once more , as he put the final touch to the great painting . randy ( v.o. ) and somewhere , in the heart of this world , stand the woman whose portrait both side be fight for . Adele bloch - bauer . int . the arbitration room . day . Randy in full flow now , the confident , experience lawyer he have become . randy during my visit to this country I have discern that there be two austrias : the one that oppose restitution to the victim of nazism , and another that recognise the injustice commit against Austria 's jewish population and seek to rectify it . we watch Dr Toman , Elizabeth gehrer and Rudolf wran respond to what he be say and then we land on hubertus : the two austrias . 108 randy ( cont 'd ) as I hope I demonstrate in my write argument , the law favour restitution . and now , during this next few scene we watch a flash montage of the journey of the painting and the way it end up in the belvedere -- ext . vienna . day . the anchluss : the viennese crowd greet the Nazis in celebration , woman throw flower to welcome they . randy ( v.o. ) a string of event and misdeed point to the incontestible fact that the painting in question reach the belvedere Gallery and remain there for over half a century in a manner that be both dishonest and illegal . and that Adele 's will itself be not legally bind . int . live room elizabethstrasse . day . the auction at elizabethstrasse . ext . elizabethstrasse . day . the painting of Adele be load onto a truck . int . the belvedere . day . and the painting come to hang on the wall of the belvedere under grimshitz 's supervision . int . the arbitration room . day . and as Randy reach the conclusion he slow he tempo a little to make sure this last few word really land . randy in its own way lady and gentlemen this be a moment of history , a moment in which the past be ask something of the present . many year ago , ( in this very city , ) just beyond this wall , terrible thing happen . people dehumanise other people - they persecute they , send many to they death , and decimate whole family break they apart forever . and they steal from they - property , livelihood and the object that be most precious to they . ( more ) 109 randy ( cont 'd ) amongst that people be the bloch - bauer , the family of a very dear friend of mine . so now I be ask you - as austrian - as human being - to recognise that wrong . ( not just for Maria altmann but for Austria . ) I be ask you today to look at the past , as I have , and to restore what have be take away . and he eye meet Maria 's . and by articulate this last word , he understand that he too , in some profound way , have be restore . and it be clear that he word have resonate with he audience , especially on the face of Toman and wran . ext . the prater park . day . Maria , Randy and hubertus be walk in the shade of the ferris wheel .
