JOHN this world could be riddled with doorway to the future . will so if we walk into that forest outside , we be really just walk into this crater year from now . maureen geological plate from different time would not fit together . that would explain the tectonic mismatch . but doorway in time , John ? JOHN if this portal be open and close , part of some cascade , natural phenomenon , they could be tear this planet apart will this portal be exactly what I predict my time machine would do . what if the doorway be not natural ? a machine that bend space , like we hyperdrive , could be modify to bend time as well . what if someone on this world have build a device ? JOHN Son , I appreciate you input but now be not the time for flight of fancy . will you never listen to I . not ever . and with that will storm out .
