saw written by James Wan &amp ; leigh whannell darkness . the soft sound of move water can be hear in the background . from the top of the screen a tiny , float light move its way downward across the screen . as it pass , we see just under the water part of a young manus face . his eye be close . the light disappear , and across the darkness appear the title S a W . the title fade away . the tiny light appear again , this time float down at the end of a tub of water , just near someoned bare foot . the camera cut again to the face of the young man underwater . this be adam . suddenly , he eye fly open and he come to life , open he mouth and gasp for air . as he wake up and struggle within the bathtub , we see he foot catch on a drain plug , unplugge it . the water start to drain , and we see go with the water the tiny light , which we can also see have some kind of key attach to it . the room itself be pitch black , but we can still just barely make he out in the dark . Adam lift himself out of the tub and fall onto the floor , cough and gasp from the shock . he manage to get to he foot , but as he move forward he realize that he ankle be chain to something . he feel he way over to a pipe in the corner , reach down and pull at he chain that be attach to it . he cry out , he voice frantic , frighten , and a bit hysterical . adam help ! someone help I ! ( he stop when he hear a loud drag sound somewhere in the room . he look out into the darkness and call out . ) be someone there ? hey ! ( he turn back to the corner to which he be chain , say in a slightly softer but still panicked voice ) shit , I m probably dead . suddenly , from out within the darkness come a manus low , raspy voice . it startles Adam . the voice , we will soon learn , belong to lawrence . lawrence youre not dead . Adam quickly turn in the direction of the voice . holding he arm out for balance , he try to look across the room to whoever be speak , but still can not see a thing . adam who 's that ? who 's that ?! lawrence ( he voice strangely a bit on the calm side , and almost irritate with adamus reaction to the situation . this shall be he tone for many scene to come . ) there 's no point in yell , I already try it . adam turn on the light ! lawrence would if I could . adam what the fuck be go on ? where be I ? ( he turn into he corner , touch the wall . ) lawrence I do nt know yet . adam ( smell something ; in disgust ) what be that smell ? lawrence shh ! hang on a second , I think I find something . with a loud click and a even louder buzzing sound , the very bright fluorescent light come to life , lighting up in row , start from lawrences end and move towards Adam . as they come on , Adam be nearly blind by the sudden change from pitch black to bright white and squint in pain , hold up he arm to cover he face . in the light we now see that he be in he mid-twenty , with short brown hair , wear a dark blue stripe shirt over a white tee shirt and jeans , look like a drown rat from the tub . it take he a moment but he eye finally start to adjust , and he look around the room . he and we see lawrence , who also wince from the glare of the light , stand by the light switch and the door . he be on the opposite end of the room , also chain to a pipe in the corner by he foot . he wear a blue button - down dress shirt , now soak with sweat stain . he be middle age , mid to late forty , with pale blonde hair and even paler skin . Dark circle be under he eye . both man be barefoot . lawrences eye adjust to the light and he see across the room . then , he gaze start towards the center of the room , as do adamus , who step forward as much as he can , a look of horror on he face . we see lie face down the body of a man who have blow he brain out , lie in a pool of blood , clad in only boxer short and a tee shirt . in he leave hand be a gun , in he right hand be a micro cassette recorder . a gunshot and a scream be hear as the camera move up and in a fast 360 ° angle above and circle the man , end in a full overhead view of he . the shot cut to Adam , who reel in shock and disgust . adam Holy shit ! he turn towards the tub and lean over , gag and cough . lawrence in the meantime hop forward the best he can , study the body with a look of fear and concern . Adam stop cough and turn back around , take another look at the body and around the room . he look down at he chain then start to completely freak out , grab and pull at he chain . adam ( scream ) help !!! ( he fall back onto he bottom on the floor as he yank at the chain as hard as he can . ) help !!! help ! lawrence just stand and watch he with a almost embarrassed , appal look at he behaviour . it seem that lawrence , despite be in the situation heus in , be above that kind of uncontrolled reaction . he speak a bit coldly . lawrence no one can hear you . Adam stop pull at the chain , stand up and look to lawrence , he breathe fast and heavy . his voice be not yell anymore but still just as hysterical . adam what the fuck be this ? lawrence calm down , just calm down . ( he know that to remain calm be to remain in control , something he must be no matter what the situation . ) be you hurt ? Adam look down at himself , shrugging slightly . adam I do nt know ... yeah ! lawrence move over to the pipe in the corner , lean against it for support . lawrence ( calmly ) what 's you name ? adam ( sarcastic ) my name be very Fucking confused ! ( demand ) what 's you name ? what 's go on here ? lawrence ( internal eye roll ; heus get more and more aggravate with adamus behaviour ) my name be lawrence Gordon , I m a doctor . I just wake up here , just like you . ( he reach up , wipe he face with he sleeve ) Adam kneel back down face the pipe , pull at he chain once more , but not with he prior panic . he wince at the metal bite into he skin . adam ( in pain ) ah ! lawrence look at Adam with a look that seem to say I m stick in here with this guy ? he then glance down at the body . lawrence recognize he ? Adam continue to pull at he chain , do not and will not look at the body , just shake he head . adam ( sharply ) no . lawrence ( try to get something out of this kid ) well , do you have any idea how you get here ? adam no . lawrence what 's the last thing you remember ? adam nothing . ( he sit back onto the floor , stop pull at he chain for a moment . ) I go to bed in my shithole apartment , and wake up in a actual shithole . ( he raise he leave leg slightly , start try to pull he foot out of the iron cuff . he glance to lawrence , who have move over to the wall to he leave , bent over slightly and rest a hand against a pipe . ) so what about you , huh ? lawrence ( he shrug slightly , shaking he head . ) well theres ... theres not much to tell , really . ( across the room , Adam give up with the chain for the time be but remain sit on the floor . ) I be on my way home from work and uh , I do nt remember anything else . Adam just sit there , glance over to the body and then focus on it much more . the initial panic have wear off for now , replace simply with fear and shock . his voice be a bit softer . adam first dead body I ve ever see . look different in real life . they do nt move . lawrence slowly lower himself into a sit position against the wall . he poke slightly at the iron cuff around he foot . lawrence from the look of this chain , someone do nt want we to go very far either . suddenly , Adam leap up , lift up he shirt and expose he abdomen . his panic be back , but not at full force like before . he study himself then glance to lawrence . adam can you see any scar ? lawrence ( look at he strangely ) what ? adam huh ? this be what they do man , ( he gesture to he stomach , where there be in fact no scar . ) they kidnap you and drug you and before you know it , youre in a bathtub and you kidney be on ebay . ( a ridiculous theory to we and to lawrence , but Adam state it with conviction . ) lawrence ( a scoffing tone in he voice ) no one have take you kidney . adam ( disbelief ) how can you tell from way over there ? lawrence ( matter of fact ) because you'd either be in terrible agony , or you'd be dead by now . trust I . adam what be you , a surgeon ? ( he lower he shirt and turn and bend down to prod at the chain around the pipe again . ) lawrence yeah . ( he sigh . he 's get tired of Adam already . he speak sharply . ) so , you gonna tell I you name , or what ? Adam stand back up , turn to lawrence , he voice once again calm . adam Adam . lawrence ( get to he foot , he voice a bit calmer ) well Adam , what we need to do ( he lean with one hand outstretch against the pipe to he right . Adam watch he , scared but calm ) be start think about why were here . whoever bring we there couldve kill we by now . but they didnt . they must want something from we . ( he look up and around the room ) question be what . ( he see something up on the wall , move forward a bit towards it . we see that it be a brand new clock on the wall , tick away . it read currently at 10:22 . ) that clock . adam what about it ? lawrence it 's brand new . ( squint , study it ) adam ( not get what heus imply ) so ? lawrence ( sigh ; it 's quite simple , why cant Adam see it ? ) so , someone obviously want we to know the time . ( Adam look a bit confuse still , mull over that information . lawrence think for a moment . ) wait , I think I may be able to reach that door . lawrence move over as far as the chain will allow he to the giant , wooden slide door , push against it as hard as he can . in the meantime , we see Adam think . he pause , then reach down and start go through he pocket . there be nothing in the front two , but in he back leave pocket he pull out a plastic baggie with a white envelope in it . he unfold the baggie ; the envelope say adam . he stare at it in he hand , wonder what it be . lawrence continue struggle with the door , quickly glance over he shoulder to see what Adam be do . he see Adam hold the baggie . Adam reach into the envelope , pull out a micro cassette tape . a close up show the word play I write on the tape label . Adam hold it in he hand , study it . lawrence turn away from the door , look over and try to see what Adam have in he hand . lawrence what be that ? ( Adam do nt answer , continue look at the tape . lawrence 's voice grow impatient . ) Excuse I . adam ( glance up briefly at lawrence , then back down at the tape . his voice sound slightly surprised . ) it 's a tape . lawrence where do you find it ? adam it be in my pocket . lawrence think about that briefly then start digging through he own pocket , find within they a white envelope with lawrence write across it in the same black lettering as adamus . adam ( regard he tape ) it say play I . lawrence tear into he envelope , empty the content into the palm of he hand . first , he hold up a similar tape to adamus . it also say play I . then he hold up a single bullet , study it , not sure what it 's there for yet . then , he hold up a tiny key . he bend over , get down on the floor and start to try to unlock he chain with the key . it do nt seem to be work . lawrence ( frustrated , mumble to himself and to the key ) come on , come on , come on .... adam ( see that it do nt seem to be work on lawrences lock ) throw it over here . lawrence give he a slightly mistrustful look , but then hold up the key and throw it . Adam miss the key at first as it hitus the floor in front of the dirty toilet near he corner . adam fuck . ( he lean over and pick up the key , then bend down and try the key on the lock on he ankle , which do nt work . he try the lock on the chain around the pipe . it be nt work there either . ) lawrence ( watch he ) no ? Adam give up , drop the key onto the floor frustratedly , shaking he head . that 's when he look over to the body again , and the shot close up on the hand hold the tape recorder . a small loop handle jut out of the handy grip . Adam stand up , then bend down and pick up the tape on the floor , look at it . he put it back down then stretch himself flat out on the floor , try to reach . unfortunately , there be still a good three to four foot between he and the body . lawrence use you shirt . adam ( get back up to he knee ) what ? lawrence you shirt . Adam look down at himself , then take off the long sleeve blue shirt . he lay back down , hold the shirt by the end of each sleeve , and throw it , try to catch it on the tape recorder . it miss . he try a second time ; same result . lawrence come on ... Adam try again ; it miss . it be just barely reach . he pull the shirt back , get back up on he knee , aggravate . adam it will nt work . lawrence ( try to get he to not give up yet ) well , look around , there must be something else you can use . adam ( stand , ready to give up , skeptical ) there 's nothing . lawrence ( insistent ) well there must be something ! Adam look around he area , then into the bathtub . he see something , bend over , take out the tub plug , which be attach to a long cord . he tie the cord around the sleeve of he shirt . he kneel down , hold out the shirt , aim . lawrence come on , you can do it . Adam throw it , attempt to get the plug through the loop at the end of the tape recorder . he miss . lawrence come on , come on , again . he try again and miss . on the third try , however , he get the plug right through the loop . lawrence smile in relief . Adam very slowly pull it back , drag the tape recorder along the floor towards he . he pick it up , get rid of the plug and drop it and the shirt on the floor . he pick up the tape , pop it in and press play , hold the tape recorder out a bit so that they can both hear , but keep he head tilt so he can hear better . a chill deep , raspy , sinister male voice the jigsaw killer come from the tape . as it speak , adamus expression be fearful , but the think how do he know ? can be detect . jigsaw ( on tape ) rise and shine , Adam . youre probably wonder where you be . ill tell you where you might be . you might be in the room that you die in . up until now , you simply sit in the shadow , watch other live out they life . but what do voyeur see when they look into the mirror ? now , I see you as a strange mix of someone angry and yet apathetic . but mostly just pathetic . so be you go to watch yourself die today , Adam ? or do something about it ? ( end ) Adam look frighten but not sure of the entire meaning of the message . adam I do nt get it . ( he press the stop button on the tape . ) lawrence ( eagerly , gesture . ) throw I the player . adam ( pause , think ) no , you throw I you tape . lawrence ( a heavy sigh . he look at Adam as a slow - minded fool who simply do nt understand the full capacity of the situation that theyre in , and speak to he as such . ) look , were go to have to work together if we want to get out of here . now just throw it to I . adam ( pick up on the tone , speak defensively ) I m not go to risk break it ! you throw I you tape ! lawrence pause , look at Adam as though hed like to smack he , then hold up and toss the tape . it hit the floor behind Adam , who kneel down and pick it up , pop it in , press play . it 's the same chill voice as on adamus tape . as the tape play , Adam stare at lawrence , and lawrence at the tape recorder . jigsaw ( on tape ) Dr. Gordon , this be you wake up call . every day of you work life , you have give people the news that they be go to die soon . now you will be the cause of death . you aim in this game be to kill Adam . ( Adam glance down at the tape recorder wide - eye , then back up at lawrence ) you have until six on the clock to do it . there '' sa man in the room with you . when there 's that much poison in you blood ( another view of the body from lawrences Pov ) , the only thing leave to do be shoot yourself . ( jigsaw cough ) there be way to win this hide all around you . just remember : X mark the spot for the treasure . if you do not kill Adam by 6:00 , then alison and diana will die , Dr. Gordon . and I ll leave you in this room to rot . let the game begin . ( end ) the look on each manus face clearly say oh shit . the tape end . lawrence stand up . lawrence ( firmly ) give I that . now . ( Adam toss he the tape . he catch it , rewind , play back . Adam stand up from he spot on the floor . ) jigsaw ( on tape ) ... then alison and diana will die , Dr. Gordon . and I ll leave you in this room to rot . adam ( think , try to figure this out ) any idea who that be ? jigsaw ( on tape ) let the game begin . adam he know we . lawrence wait a minute . ( rewind more ) adam ( false hope ) what do you think ? probably a joke , right ? lawrence shh , shh ! ( press play ) jigsaw ( on tape ) let the game begin . lawrence ( softly ) listen ... jigsaw ( on tape , in a very hushed tone after a brief silence ) ... follow you heart . lawrence stop the tape . adam what the hell do follow you heart mean ? lawrence be look around , on the wall and everywhere else in the bathroom for a heart . he spot a small one draw in brown on the toilet next to Adam and point . lawrence there ! right next to you , on the toilet . Adam look , see the toilet . slowly , he bend down , rest he hand on the seat , look down into the bowl of liquid shit , not really sure what heus look for . lawrence ( impatient , gesture ) come on , come on . Adam glance up at lawrence with a look of youve get to be kid I , but lawrence watch he expectantly . Adam sigh , then reach in with he right hand , fishing around in the mess . adam oh man ... ( he gasp , make gag sound , he face turn away from the bowl . he cough , fish around for another brief moment , then quickly pull back , try to shake some of the shit off of he hand , spitting . lawrence ( expectantly ) anything ? adam ( disgust ) no solid . lawrence take off the lid . ( he point to the lid . Adam look to it , slowly stand up , reach for it . lawrence have no patience . ) come on ! Adam take off the lid , place it down on the toilet seat . the water be clearer inside , and he reach in and pull out something wrap up in a black garbage bag . he hold it up for lawrence to see , turn to he . adam I really wish I have check in there first . lawrence huh . ( he smile slightly ) what be it ? Adam tear into the bag , reach in and pull out two hacksaws . he drop the bag on the floor , bend down and take up he chain , hold one of the hacksaws and beginning to see at the chain with it . lawrence watch he for a moment . lawrence hey ! ( Adam turn and look . lawrence speak in a irritate voice ) mind pass I the other one ? Adam reach over and pick up the other hacksaw , then carefully throw it across the room . it hit the pipe to lawrences leave . lawrence reach down and pick it up , then sit down on the floor . Quick shot back to Adam , who , while lawrence be preoccupy with pick up the hacksaw , quickly pick up the garbage bag and toss it into the bathtub . both man start to see away at they chain furiously , but neither be make any progress . suddenly , adamus see snap in the middle , and he temper flare . adam ( enraged ) fuck ! fuck ! ( he react violently , hit the break see twice against the iron pipe then turn and hum it across the room , right into a mirror . a small piece of the mirror break off and fly to the floor . ) lawrence glance over at what Adam have do , then go back to saw for another moment . Adam sit back down , breathe heavily , lean against the pipe in he corner . finally , lawrence give up , turn and sit with he back against the pipe , also breathe heavily for a moment . he sit there , when a look of realization come across he face . he hold up the see , look at it , understanding . he lower it to the floor , shaking he head slightly . lawrence ( everything be become more clear now ) he do nt want we to cut through we chain . he want we to cut through we foot . ( Adam look up at he , eyebrow raise . ) I think I may know who' do this to we . adam what do you say ? ( he stand up ; be lawrence hide something from he ? ) lawrence it 's not someone I know personally . its ... just someone I know of . adam ( get slightly frantic again ) Jesus Christ ! tell I , who be it ?! the camera close up on lawrences face . to the right of it , the screen be fade into a flashback of a crime scene . as lawrence speak , he face fade and the flashback scene grow clearer , until it be only the crime scene , with three detective walk down a flight of stair . lawrence the last I hear ... the police still have nt catch he . we now see the three figure descend through a trap door down a flight of stair . the lighting be a bright lime green that be strangely dark at the same time . the trio enter a small , cell like room with a low ceiling . they be tapp , sing , and kerry . tapp be a tall black man in he late forty - early fifty . sing be a asian man in he mid to late thirty , and Kerry be a caucasian woman in she mid to late thirty with long , curly brown hair that be tie back in a ponytail . all be well dress , sing and tapp in suit , the woman in a jacket and dress slack . they be the detective work on this case . as they move into the room , sing see something that bring a look of shock to he face , shine a flashlight on it . we can not see it yet . lawrence ( vo ) and the only reason I know that be because I be a suspect . tapp come into the room last , ducking slightly from he height , and come up alongside sing , look at the same thing . lawrence ( vo ) I ll start from the beginning . kerry this oneus not fresh anymore . at least three week out . ( detective tapp squint as he peer in and study the body ) victimus a 46 - year old male . ( Quick flash of a crime scene photo , a closeup of behind the manus head and upper back . there be deep cut all over . the camera cut upwards to the detective . ) die of massive blood loss . mostly through the femoral artery . ( the camera pan around to detective tapp , who move around the side of the cage to get a better look inside , shine he flashlight in . ) he start at the back of the cage and tunnele he way through the razor wire so fast it 's amazing he get as far as he do . cut himself so deep , we find trace of stomach acid on the floor . ( another more gruesome crime scene photo shot of the body from the side ; we can see the razor wire digging in under he arm . also , a close - up shot of some of he wound ; long , deep cut . ) we also find this . ( she hold up a evidence baggie with a micro cassette tape recorder , just like the one Adam and lawrence find in they cell . she press the play button , and tapp and sing listen . it 's the same chill voice from Adam and lawrences tape . ) jigsaw ( on tape ) hello Paul . you be a perfectly healthy , sane , middle - class male . yet last month , you run a straight razor across you wrist . do you cut yourself because you truly want to die , or do you just want some attention ? tonight , youll show I . the irony be that if you want to die , you just have to stay where you be . but if you want to live , youll have to cut yourself again . ( flashback shot of Paul waking up in the cage , look around , scared and confuse . the shot go back and forth between the detective and the Paul flashback , with he grab and shaking the razor wire , scream . his scream sound distant under jigsaws voice . ) find the path through the razor wire to the door . but hurry . at 3:00 that door will lock and then this room become you tomb . how much blood will you shed to stay alive , Paul ? ( end ) kerry ( stop the tape ) the door be on a timer . it be unlock until 3:00 . then it slam shut . he be give two hour . cut back to detective tapp , who notice something and shine he light on it . we see a strange wound on paulk body , a piece of flesh carve out into the shape of a jigsaw piece . tapp jigsaw piece . ( sing look in as well , see it . there be a quick flash of crime scene photo show a close up of the wound . tapp sigh . ) I think were gonna be here for a while , sing . ( sing look to he . we get another quick crime scene shot of Paul . ) lawrence ( vo ) the newspaper start call he the jigsaw killer . cut back to lawrence in the bathroom . for he next two speak line , the shot switch back and forth between he and the detective in the razor wire room . lawrence actually , technically speak , heus not really a murderer . he never kill anyone . sing , wear glove , get in the cage and examine paulk body a bit . a flash of another crime scene photo of the wound with a ruler hold up to it be show . more gruesome crime scene photo of that and other wound be flashed across the screen . lawrence ( vo ) he find way for he victim to kill themselves . cut to sing kneele down over a char corpse , completely blacken , at another crime scene . we hear jigsaws voice from a tape recorder play over the scene as the detective look around , and over the flashback shot . jigsaw ( vo , on tape ) hello Mark . if youre so sick , then why do I have so many photo of you up and about ? ( there be a quick montage of a camera snap several black and white shot of Mark up and about , look around and get into a car . ) letus put you so-called illness to the test . ( flashback image of Mark waking up . he be a young man in he mid to late twenty , with dark brown hair . he be completely nude , smear in some kind of vaseline - like ointment . in front of he be a small , square glass plate hold up by some chain . on the plate be a micro cassette player , a light votive candle , and a box of match . he get up , look around confusedly and scared . ) right now , there be a slow - act poison in you vein . the antidote be in the safe . ( Black and white crime scene shot of the safe , then a shot of Mark stand over it , scream , he scream distant under jigsaws voice , as with Paul . ) the combination to the safe ( quick montage of several black and white crime - scene photo of number write all over the wall ) be write on the wall . hurry up and program it in . but watch you step ( mark bare foot step on the break glass scattered all across the floor ) . and by the way , that 's a flammable substance smear on you body ( shot of Mark look at the ointment on he hand , up he arm , everywhere ) , so I would be careful with that candle , if I be you ... MARK ( huddle over the safe ; scream , but it be still distant sounding ) help !!!!! jigsaw ( vo ctd ) .... or all the people youve burn with you act ( Mark start to turn the lock on the safe ) just might have they revenge . we see Mark desperately go around the room , hold the candle , look at the wall , try to find a combination . the camera go back and forth a few time in a sped - up shot to he do this and turn a the lock on the safe , try to program the combination into the safe . he move in a circle , clockwise to we . when he get to face right in front of we , the flame from the candle flare up and engulf the shot , flaring into a close - up crime scene photo of mark char face . the shot move back to the trio of detective , with sing hold the tape recorder . kerry I find something else . well , two thing , actually . ( she move past they and we go with she over to a wall where there be a small hole cut , about a inch or two in diameter . the light from the outside shine in . ) there be someone stand outside here watch through this peephole . look like we friend jigsaw like to book himself front row seat to he own sick little game . he be there at the last one as well . ( she walk over to sing and tapp ) only this time , he leave we he penlight . ( she hold up the penlight in a evidence baggie , click it twice then hand it to tapp . ) tapp ( take the baggie , study it ) get a rush on the print . ( he hand it back to she . ) kerry ( take the baggie , move out of the room ) copy that . CUT to Hospital room . lawrence in he white doctork coat along with three blue-scrub clad medical student . a nurse in white stand off to the side . lawrence be go over the patient chart . he go over to the x- ray display , push the light on to view two x- ray of someoned skull . he point to it with he pen as he speak . lawrence okay . this patient have a inoperable frontal lobe tumor extend across the midline . start as colon cancer . ( he turn back to the three young medical student . one of they , a pretty asian girl name carla , smile at lawrence as he speak , seem particularly infatuated with he . ) the patient have come in for a standard checkup by which we be able to monitor the rate at which he condition be decline . in the doorway , a orderly push a cart of clean supplies be pass by and stop when he see lawrence and the medical student in the room , listen to what lawrence be say . this be Zep . hes a man in he early to late forty dress in orderly white with short brown hair and large blue eye that show a kindness that the other in the room seem to be lack . kindness , and something else below the surface . he glance down at John sleep , then up at lawrence . lawrence the patient have ... zep ( cut he off ) his name be John , Dr. Gordon .

( he look to the student , who all share he smug smile ) as you can see , we orderly form very special bond with the patient . ( Zep just stare at lawrence , he expression mostly blank but with pure loathing just underneath the surface . the look seem to say fuck you , Dr. Gordon . he stare at he for a moment , then turn away , and continue down the hall with he cart . ) continue on , the patient .... but he be cut off by a voice on the intercom . intercom Dr. Gordon , Dr. lawrence Gordon , please page the operator . lawrence ( a smug but annoyed smirk ) obviously someone do nt want I to tell you what the patient have .

( lawrence do nt answer , just continue he pace . the lawyer get frustrated , noisily put down he pen . ) look , if you can nt be honest with I ... lawrence ( his tone quick , almost blurt ) I be visit someone . it be nt a patient . alright ? ( he sigh , shake he head . he 's fuck , either way . ) what be I gonna do ? lawyer well , as you lawyer and you friend , my advice to you be to bite the bullet and give they you alibi now . because no one be go to believe you later . cut back to the bathroom . lawrence , still sit against the wall , throw down he hacksaw next to he , rest he hand against he knee . lawrence ( sigh ) that be five month ago . he try to set I up for murder . cut back to the interrogation room , some time later . lawrence be sit alone at the table . sing come through the door , shut it behind he . sing okay . we check you alibi . it hold up . ( his voice indicate that he still believe theres more to it ; he do not and will not trust lawrence . ) lawrence good ! can I go home now ? sing ( continue ) we have one of the victim who manage to escape . ( as he speak , we see a young woman with brown hair in a ponytail wear a visitor pass be lead carefully into the room next to they and sit at a table . this be amanda . lawrence and sing can see she clearly ; she can not see they . ) want to know if you would nt mind stick around and listen to she testimony ? maybe itll trigger something . ( tapp and a unidentified bald black man in a suit enter the room . the man guide amanda into she chair , stand behind she against the wall . tapp sit in a chair to she leave . ) lawrence ( do nt really care ) id like to help , really , but ... sing ( cut he off quickly , will nt let he out of this that easily ) well , wed really appreciate it . she 's the only one who make it . lawrence ( quietly , give in . ) okay . camera move into the interrogation room with amanda , tapp , and the unidentified man . as tapp speak , the camera slowly move closer over he shoulder and towards amanda . as we get closer to she , we see long , strange , scar- like marking along each side of she mouth . she be shake , she eye distant , never look anyone , include tapp , in the eye . it be clear that she mind be still lose somewhere within she nightmare . tapp ( speak slowly , gently ) amanda ... in you own time , tell I the first thing you remember . we move closer and closer to amanda , then suddenly the camera spin round quickly and snap into a alternate view of she , she flashback . the room she be in have the same lime - green lighting as paulk cell . amanda sit in a chair wear a strange iron contraption around she head , a bear- trap like device cover she mouth . we can see she eye , surround with black eyeliner , as they slowly open , groggy , just waking up . amanda ( vo ) I wake up . all I could taste be blood . ( the camera move back quickly , and we see she tie to the chair , she wrist bound to the arm of the chair . she pull against she bond , moan loudly , try to speak or cry out but cannot . ) and metal . she continue to struggle against she bond some more . the camera circle around she , and we get a better view of the strange device on she head , and the padlock and timer on the back of it . a long wire hang down from the timer and below the screen . the view switch to the side of she and we see next to she a old television set , which suddenly switch on , startling she . after a brief moment of static , the frightening image of a dement clown - like doll its face white with red spiral on its cheek , its red eye leer at amanda from the screen . she stare at it , she moan a bit softer to match she fear and utter confusion . the doll speak , the jaw move ; it be the voice of jigsaw . jigsaw ( from the tv ) hello amanda . you do nt know I , but I know you . I want to play a game . here 's what happen if you lose . ( the video move next to the doll , to a device like the one sheus wear attach to a mannequin head . as he continue , explain what it be , she breathe grow faster and heavier , and she moan pick up more . ) the device youre wear be hook into you upper and lower jaw . when the timer at the back go off , you mouth will be permanently rip open . think of it like a reverse bear trap . here , I ll show you . the video pan back to a view of the doll and the device . the doll head move and look down at the device , and the camera zoom in on it . a timer tick away . a few second later , SNAP ! the device spring and the fake head be crush and explode . amanda shriek , she eye widen . the video switch back to a close up of the doll . jigsaw ( from the tv ) there be only one key to open the device . it 's in the stomach of you dead cellmate . look around , amanda . know that I m not lie . you better hurry up . live or die . make you choice . the video go to white and gray static , then switch off . amanda begin to struggle like a madwoman against she bond and the chair . the camera swing around she , circle , make she movement fast and jerky . amanda manage to pull one arm free , then the other and stand up quickly . that 's when the cord in the back of the device be pull out , and the timer start . she freeze , she eye widen . we see a close - up of the timer , and it begin its sixty second countdown . she reach behind she head , pull at the lock and the timer , try to pull it off , but it be stick there . she start freaking out , pull at it as much as she can , the camera movement once again fast and jerky around she . the camera spin back to amanda sit still in she chair in the interrogation room , sniffle . we see a brief shot of lawrence , who watch and listen to she with grim amazement . back to amanda . amanda and then I see the body . we switch back into amandak cell . over she shoulder , we see near the corner the body of a man lie on the floor on he back . amanda cautiously approach it , the timer still tick away , she hand still at the device . she kneel down cautiously next to he . she reach down and with a shaking hand lift up he shirt , revealing a large , black question mark draw on he abdomen . she sob harder , hunch over he . Quick cut to the interrogation room , amanda in the center of the shot . amanda there be a knife . back to the cell . amanda , still lean over , pick up a small knife next to the body . she slowly bring it up in both of she shaking hand , clutching it . she look closer at it . a quick shot of the timer show it to be at 25 second now , almost halfway . the camera move to a shot of the manus face , when ... he open he eye and start to wake up . he moan , unable to speak or move . his eye slowly , groggily look around a bit . he can not even open he mouth ; someone have very heavily drugge he . he see amanda over he with a knife and he eye widen ; he try to moan at she to stop , to not do what sheus about to do , but she turn the knife upside down in both hand and quickly stab down . he moan in agony in the background as she stab down again , and again , and again . blood splashes on she hand . a quick shot back of lawrence as he listen , he mouth open slightly , eye wide , stare at she . cut back to amanda in the cell as she stab down a few more time . then back again to the table in lawrence 's interrogation room . sing throw down a evidence baggie with a use syringe in it . sing ( vo as camera pan up to lawrence ) hed be injected with a opiate overdose . he could nt move or feel much of anything . lawrence you mean .... he be alive ? sing ( stare , nod slightly ) be . back to amandak interrogation room , she head still hang , still sniffle . a view of tapp as he ask tapp what happen after you take it off ? cut back to the cell , she bloody hand sifting through intestine for a key . cut back to interrogation room amanda , then cut back again to she hold up a liver or some other organ . back to interrogation room amanda , the horror on she face grow , then back to the cell . amanda 's hand pull a small key from inside the organ sheus hold . she reach around the back of she head , quickly try to unlock the padlock . the timer tick away , faster and faster . she get it , pull off the padlock and open the device in the back , rip it away from she head and throw it down as it snap open . she let out the most terrible , agonize , heart - wrenching scream , sobbing loudly , she hand hold out in front of she , rock back and forth . suddenly from another corner of the room , a light come on , revealing the puppet from the video in the corner . amanda see it , stare at it wide eye , she sob soften for a moment as she stare at it . slowly , it wheel towards she on a tricycle . she can only stare and cry , not sure what to do or expect . it stop , leer at she , then speak . jigsaw congratulation . you be still alive . most people be so ungrateful to be alive . but not you . not anymore . cut back into a close up of amanda in the interrogation room , she head still shaking a bit , almost like a series of slight spasm . she continue to sniffle , she eye far off . cut to tapp . tapp you be , in fact , a drug addict . be nt that right , Mandy ? ( she nod , but do nt look up . ) do you think that be why he pick you ? ( she let out a sob , briefly nodd once . ) be you grateful , Mandy ? she finally raise she head , look into he eye for the first time . amanda ( softly ) he ... help I . as she start sniffle and breathe more heavily , tapp look over he shoulder into lawrences room , right in he direction . he may not see he , but he know heus there . the camera then cut back to amanda , who start sobbing more heavily again . slowly , the camera move down into and under the table , fade back into a overhead view of the bathroom where lawrence and Adam be . Adam sit in he corner , stare down at the floor as he have be listen to lawrences story . he look up across to lawrence . adam ( softly ) be you sure it 's he ? lawrence ( nod slightly ) yeah , I m sure . adam ( become a little hysterical again . he speak accusingly ) how do I know youre tell the truth ? you can be the one who put I in this room ! ( he gesticulates as he speak , point to lawrence and himself . ) lawrence ( internal eye roll , speak slowly , as to a simpleton ) I m in exactly the same situation youre in . adam wrong . ( he stand up , kick he chain foot out . shout . ) wrong ! youve get one thing I do nt : information ! ( he hover as close as he can in a threaten pose , point ) you know who do this ! ( he pick up a glass shard that fall when he break the mirror , hold it up threateningly to lawrence ) now you either tell I what be really go on ( lawrence roll he eye , turn he head over to he leave , away from Adam ) or I ll cut you with this , you hear I ? ill cut - ( but he stop short as he see something in the glass . he flip it over , study it , flip it back . he look over to the mirror on the wall , study it , think . ) lawrence notice that adamus ranting have end , glance over at he . lawrence what ? adam ( look over at lawrence , then back at the mirror . ) it 's a two - way mirror . Adam drop the shard down on the floor carefully , then reach over to the corner behind he , lean down and pick up a loose padlock . he lift it up and throw it as hard as he can against the mirror , shatter most of the glass . lawrence briefly startles at the sound and force of the glass shatter . Adam reach back down , find another piece of debris and throw that at the mirror with just as much force . the rest of the glass break away , and a camera with a red light can bee see behind a clear glass . lawrence stand up to get a better look at it . we movie in closer to the camera , get a better look at it as well . suddenly there be a flash of static and we find ourselves look at a fuzzy , black and white surveillance video of lawrence and Adam in the bathroom , stare right at we into the camera . the shot pull back a bit and we see that the video be on a silver surveillance monitor . a partial view of other recording - type equipment can be see on either side of the monitor . a manus voice speak , though it do nt sound quite the same as on the jigsaw tape . as he speak , a hand wear a black leather glove raise up slightly and wave its finger at the screen . man ( os , taunting ) I can see you ... adam ( from on video ) so that 's what this be . reality tv . man ( os . still taunting , sound as though on a power trip ) do nt look at I . I can nt help you . the shot transition from the video view of Adam back into regular view in the bathroom . Adam stand in a threaten pose to the camera , speak angrily , loudly to it , he voice drip with sarcasm . adam can you hear I in there ? huh ? I m have a blast . ( he bend down and pick up another piece of debris from the floor ) this be the most fun I ve have without lubricant . ( hum the piece of debris at the window . it make a thwack sound , but do nt break . not even a crack . ) make sure youre get everything . ( bend down , throw pick up and throw another piece of debris . it hit , but no breakage . leans down for another piece . ) lawrence ( scoff tone as he watch Adam try to break the glass ) that 's not go to do anything . adam ( pause , look to lawrence ) you just want to leave it run on we ? ( the shot switch to surveillance view ) lawrence ( very matter - of - fact ) well , you will nt stop it . ( shot switch to regular view ) that 's why we can nt cut through this chain . it 's why you will nt break that glass . ( he gesture to the pipe then the glass ) every possible angle have be pre-thought out by he . ( he appear deep in think , start to understand the set - up more so , figure out the way this guy think . almost admire he . the situation may be bad , but it 's a brilliant design . ) adam you sound like you admire this prick . lawrence ( explain ) to overcome something , you have to understand what a perfect engine it be . that 's how you fight disease . ( he look up at the ceiling , at the wall , around the room ) now the tape tell we to find a X . that X have to be somewhere in this room . ( determine ) help I find it . Adam do not help he look . he simply cannot believe lawrences calm demeanor in this situation anymore . it seem that he be almost become as sick of lawrence 's attitude as lawrence be of he . he speak a with a bit of a hyper tone again , accusingly . adam how can you be the calm Doctor guy when you wife and kid be out there . ( shot of lawrence look around the room ) he 's get they , too . ( shot of the clock ; it 's now 12:05 . ) he could be do anything to they right now . be you think about that ? lawrence ( suddenly look right at he , snap angrily ) I am think about that . ( Adam back off a bit . lawrence pause a moment , he voice change to calm but sad . ) I ve be the last thing I say to my daughter . lawrence turn away from Adam , place he hand on the pipe behind he , and the shot move up into blackness , then up at the foot of a little girlusl bed in a darken bedroom . the little girl be diana . she 's about 5 or 6 year old , with long , wavy light brown hair . she lay tuck in with she eye close , she favourite teddy bear wrap in she leave arm . the camera move up and over she a bit , move in closer to she . Chimes can be hear tinkling very faintly against a soft breeze . as the shot pause just above she , she eye suddenly open , blink away sleepiness . she sit up , pull away the cover , still hold she teddy bear . she remain sit in she bed , stare over into the dark corner to she right . the chime jingle away . we move in closer to she face ; something have she spook . a clock tick be suddenly hear as the image fade from diana get out of bed into a strange , mechanical - look clock on the live room wall of the Gordon Household . the shot lower and we see the nicely furnish live room of the Gordon home . the wall be a dark , crimson red , the furniture in tone of red and brown . it definitely be the live room of a well - off family . not too cold , but not as warm and homey as it could be . diana slowly make she way across the live room towards she parent bedroom , move almost dream -like , she teddy bear hang limply from she right hand . she move to the frost glass double door of she parent room , open they both into the bedroom , where we see she mother , alison , lay on she side , fast asleep . alison be in she early to mid thirty with long blond hair go just past she shoulder and very pretty despite she sleepiness and messy hair in this scene . diana move into the room , stand next to the bed , say nothing , just watch she mother sleep . alisonk eye slowly open ; the feel of be watch plus the instinct of a mother have awoken she . she reach over and turn on the light , look upon she daughter with concern . alison diana , honey , be you okay ? ( she push back the cover and get up , crouching down in front of she daughter . look up at she , she place she hand on she daughterus arm . ) diana , honey , can you hear I ? diana ( very softly , but show almost no fear ) mommy ? alison reach up and touch dianass hair , bring she hand down in a soft caress on dianass cheek . alison oh , what be it , sweet pea ? diana ( very calmly ) there 's a man in my room . alison ( sighing , but not rudely . this be not the first time this have happen ) oh honey , be you sure heus not just hide in you imagination ? diana he talk to I . alison ( sigh ) okay , I ll come and check you room . ( she smile a small , assure smile ) diana I want daddy . hell get the scary man . alison ( she smile fade a bit ) alright , if you want . come on . she stand and lead diana out of the room . cut to lawrence 's office . lawrence sit hunch slightly over he laptop computer , focus on some paper heus write . diana and alison appear in the doorway to he leave . he do nt even look up , just keep type . alisonk tone when she speak indicate that she know hell probably say no , or put it off on she . alison Larry , sorry to bother you , but you daughter have a bad dream again . lawrence ( he eye never leave the screen ; raise he finger to pause they ) just a minute . alison she want you to check she room . lawrence ( keep type , never look up ) mmm hmm , mmm hmm , just gotta finish this paragraph . alison wait a moment , then turn to diana . alison ( softly ) you know what sweetie ? ill go check with you . they turn , slowly start to walk away as lawrence quickly finish type , then close the laptop . lawrence nope ! I m do . ( he smile , turn to look at they . ) cut to dianass room . lawrence reach over and turn on the lamp on dianass side table . diana lie in bed , slightly propped up against she pillow and stuff animal . lawrence sit on the side of she bed . lawrence ( very reassuringly ) see ? ( he pull the cover up over she , up to she chest . ) there 's no one in you room . there 's no such thing as the bad man . now can you go to sleep ? diana I m still scared . lawrence you be ? give I you tootsie .

( cut to a shot of diana , lay on she side in she darken room , clutching she teddy bear to she chest . her eye be open , she can hear everything . we stay with she for the rest of alisonk line , she voice now off a bit in the distance but still very audible ) id rather you break down and tell I that you hate I . at least thered be some passion in it . lawrence would you like to see she ? ( he reach into he pocket and take out he wallet , throw it across the room to Adam , who be sit with he back against the wall , face lawrence . Adam pick up the wallet and open it . he see two picture of diana , side by side . the one on the leave be diana hugging a dog . the one on the right be a smile portrait outside somewhere . adam she 's beautiful . lawrence thank you . adam ( sigh , then look up at lawrence ) you gonna have any more kid ? lawrence ( a bit wearily , but not snobby ) weve talk about it , but uh , with we schedule , it 's difficult enough to concentrate on one . ( the tone of he voice indicate that maybe heus start to realize that he shouldve spend more time and attention to he daughter . ) adam ( refer to the wallet ) so where 's the lucky wife ? ( a small smile ) lawrence there 's another picture behind the one youre look at . ( Adam reach behind the photo on the right and pull another photograph out . lawrence smile slightly as he speak ) it 's my favourite one because were all in it together . someone , usually I , have to hold the camera , which mean I m always miss from the photo . cut to Adam , look at the picture he pull out . his face be blank , but you can sense great disturbance behind it . cut to a shot of the photo he be hold . it be not the one lawrence describe , but a Polaroid of alison and diana bound and gag , and the message regards with a jigsaw piece draw next to it . he turn the photo over , and there be a message . as he read it , jigsaw read it aloud in a voiceover . jigsaw ( vo ) X Marks the spot . sometimes you see more with you eye shut . Adam do he best to hide what he have see , look up to lawrence . adam it 's uh , it 's not here . lawrence ( a slight disturbance from he momentary nostalgic bliss ) what ? adam uh , this photo youre talk about ... itus not here . lawrence ( slightly surprised , reach out he hand for Adam to toss the wallet . ) really ? be you sure ? adam yeah . ( tuck the picture in he right hand , he shift slightly by lift himself a bit with he right hand , sneakily put the photograph down and toss the wallet with he leave hand . lawrence pick up the wallet and start look for it , crease he brow in concern , while Adam back up against he wall , hold the photograph out of lawrences sight against a pipe he rest he arm on as he look at the photograph . ) lawrence ( disbelief , shaking he head ) he ...he mustve take it . I ... alisonk voice over be hear as he say this and continue to look through the wallet , and we hear alisonk voiceover from the scene in the main hall . alison ( vo ) how can you walk through life pretend that youre happy ? CUT to the Main Hall of the Gordon residence , back to the earlier flashback of lawrence and alison . this time , we stay with they . lawrence I be happy . ( he walk over to a chair , lean over it as he put something down , get he briefcase ready to go to work . alison stand a few foot behind he , try she best to get he to react , to stop the bullshit and end the masquerade . ) alison ( piss ) that be complete bullshit . id rather you break down and tell I that you hate I . at least thered be some passion in it . lawrence ( tired of this , brush it off as not that important , like there really be nothing wrong ) we can talk about this alter , okay ? ( he lean in to kiss she , but she shake she head . he pause there . ) alison ( firmly ) just leave . he look at she for a moment , search , then slowly turn away and head out the door . voice goodnight , little girl . ( camera pan up closer into the closet , and we a widen blue eye and part of a face ( yet unidentifiable ) watch she . ) the closet door burst open and diana scream . cut back to the main hall where alison stand alone , she head lower slightly . as soon as she hear the scream she turn and bolt towards she daughterus room . alison diana !? alison get to just outside the door to she bedroom . alison diana ! ( open the door and flip on the light , gasp when she see a figure cover by a blanket loom over dianass bed . the figure suddenly grab diana and she scream , struggle against he . alison go for they . Quick cut to now , in alison and lawrence 's bedroom . waistline shot of a figure wear a black coat , black leather glove and blue jeans , hold a stethoscope . a gun be tuck into he belt and dianass teddy bear tuck under he arm . he saunter over to the gag and bound diana and alison , on the floor and tie to a corner end of the bed . alison , she eye stream tear , struggle and pull against she bond to try to get at he but fail . diana keep cry mommy ! over and over again and sobbing . the figure crouch down beside diana , drop the teddy bear behind she , he face still unseen . he take the stethoscope and hold the end to dianass chest . the sound of a loud , steady heartbeat be hear . alison scream at he through she gag . alison do nt do that ! leave she ! get away from she ! he pull away the stethoscope and the heartbeat halt . he reach with he right hand and pull from he belt the gun . dianass scream become more desperate , alisonk more frantic , more angry . he put the stethoscope back against dianass chest and move the gun up and down in front of she , then bring it up to she motherus head . we hear the heartbeat again , double in speed . alison ( through she gag ) keep you motherfuck hand off of my daughter ! he pull away the gun and the stethoscope , tucking the gun back into he belt . he reach down behind diana and pick up the teddy bear . as he do , we catch a brief glimpse of the lower half of he face , but not enough for a clear identification yet . he hold the teddy bear out in front of diana for a moment then tuck it in front of she . he pat she on the head and stand up , move over to the window . he part the curtain slightly and lean forward a bit , and we see he face more clearly . it be Zep , the orderly from the hospital . cut to static , and then a surveillance video view of the exterior of the Gordon home , of the window where Zep be stand . the camera zoom in on he and we hear a raspy , male voice speak . voice ( vo as we view shot of Zep ) who be you little man ...

( he grab he gun , snap a cartridge into it , grabsup he coat , and quickly follow tapp . brief shot of k2k graffiti on the video and then loud static , which snap into a exterior nighttime view of a old warehouse building and a car speed by . we view be from inside the car as it pull up alongside the building . a police radio can be hear in the background . so can the sound of a gun be load and cocked . tapp ( vo ) at least well have the cover of darkness . sing ( vo ) yeah , well , so will anybody else . a shot of inside the factory , various clutter and table pile up on one another . no sign of life ... yet . a bang from the outside of the door be hear . a couple more bang and a shot of the giant , slide wooden door as it slide open , and sing step in , hold out he shotgun , ready for anything wait for they . cut up to a staircase , light by eerie green light , the same as from paulk razor wire room , as the detective make they way up cautiously , tapp in front , sing cover behind they . they come up another level , one that have be recently use we see as tapp point over to a desk with a computer , a radio , and some other miscellaneous item . then , right next to the desk , we see the k2k graffiti from the video . tapp I get you ... they continue on , move into a room separate with a chain link fence . there be a slightly raise platform , go along part of the wall , with a few step lead up on either side . tapp go up the step . on the raise area be some table cover in heavy red cloth . tapp point to one , reach down , and pull back the cover . he reveal a small diorama of the bathroom scene where Adam and lawrence doll , complete with the body , doll represent each of they . tapp what the hell be this ?....... ( he voice almost a whisper ) oh shit ... they move onto the next table , and tapp pull back the cloth cover that one , revealing the leer puppet from amandak video . tapp stare at it wide - eye . next to the puppet be a strange , boar- like mask with long dark hair . the camera pan back so we have the view of another large object cover in red cloth that tapp and sing have pass by . tapp lean in closer to look at the puppet , when suddenly the still - cover form start to move and muffle moan sound be hear . it startles the detective . sing oh fuck ! they both go over and stand on either side of it , take one end of the red cloth whipping it off . underneath be a man tie to a chair with duct tape over he mouth , hold in place by a manacle around he neck . a contraption on the chair hold two power drill about six inch from either side of he head , point directly at he temple . his eye wide , he moan through he tape at the detective . suddenly , a door be hear clanging open on the other side of the building , and the detective spin to face the sound , gun ready . tapp ( look to sing , say softly ) wait sing ! sing ( try to keep he voice low but come off a bit loudly ) what ? tapp ( eager ) letus see what heus gonna do . sing why ? we ve fuck get he . tapp however , have study this guy for so long , want to get a good look at he before heus capture , see he in he element . tapp we do nt know what he look like . letus see what heus gonna do . sing ( rather loudly , again ) no fuck way ! as the two argue , the man in the chair continue to protest he position . tapp sing , sing !

I m gonna take he . tapp sing ! sing what the fuck ? shit ! tapp wait sing , listen . whoever it be be move closer , so they quickly cover up the man and the other thing they uncover . the man in the chair protest loudly through he gag and struggle as much as he can in he chair . sing and tapp go and hide behind a tarp cover the entryway to another room while a figure in a black robe line in red come up on the elevator . the elevator stop , and the figure move forward , slowly and carefully . he go up the step to the man in the chair . the figure hood be up ; we do not see he face . as he walk , he seem like he might be have a somewhat difficult time with it . he reach and uncover the man , who beg in muffle tone through the gag . when the figure speak , we instantly know it be jigsaw ; it be the unmistakable voice from the tape and the video . jigsaw awake already , Jeff ? I need more powerful tranquilizers next time . ( Jeff continue he cry , shed a few tear . jigsaw reach over and touch he shoulder ) do nt cry . I ve give you life a purpose . youre a test subject for something great than yourself . that 's when sing cock the shotgun and the two detective move out of they hide spot , aim they weapon at jigsaw . sing freeze !

( he see a box on the side of the chair and open it . Inside he pull out a ring of at least 30 key , and go over to behind Jeff to try to unlock the device . he try a couple of key , none work . ) fuck ! which key , which key ?! tapp tell he which key it be ! jigsaw ( now face tapp , move closer to he . his back be to we , we still do nt see he face . ) time be run out . tapp shut up and get down here right now , asshole ! jigsaw slowly move down towards he more . jigsaw what 's more important to you Officer , arrest I or the life of another human be ? sing keep try various key . tapp go up jigsaw and grab he , push he down to he knee . jigsaw keep he arm slightly raise . tapp get down on you knee ! sing Jesus ! tapp ! tapp ! tapp ( gun aim at the back of jigsaws head ) hand behind you head !

Jeff close he eye , cry , as the drill be only 2 inch away ) tapp ! it 's like , there 's a hundred key in here ! jigsaw sick from the disease eat away at I inside . sick of people who do nt appreciate they blessing . sick of that who scoff at the suffer of other . sing finally whip out he gun and shoot each drill , break and stop they . tapp glance up at he , briefly distract by the gunfire . jigsaw ( as he pop a blade out of a wristband hide up he right sleeve ) sick of it all ! ( he lash upwards , slashing tapps throat ) sing ( see the throat slash ) tapp !!! ( run down from Jeff towards they . tapp clutches he throat , completely surprised , gurgle . ) jigsaw run , fast as he can , out of the room . sing take a couple of shot at he and miss . he stop when he reach tapp , who be slump against the fence / wall and bend down next to he . sing ( desperate , a trace of despair ) no , no ! tapp ! shit ! tapp gurgle at he , hand he the shotgun . sing ( stand , touch tapp on the shoulder then head ) I ll be back , okay ? I ll be back . tapp just kind of nod , gurgle and hold he throat . sing spin around and then start chase jigsaw through the warehouse , out of the room and down a flight of stair . he move down a long , misty corridor , gun up , move quickly but still cautiously . he take a right , go down another flight of stair then take another right , stop and look down a short flight of stair . Quick cut to tapp start to try to get up , hold he throat . he drag himself along the floor . back to sing , who cock he shotgun , then move down the stair very cautiously . he take a leave around the corner , find himself face down another corridor , where he see jigsaw try to get away . he take aim . sing ( shouting ) freeze or I ll shoot ! jigsaw continue move , so sing fire . he hit , and jigsaw go down . sing pause , wait to see if he get back up . jigsaw do nt move , so sing cock the gun again and start to slowly move forward towards he . cut to a shot of tapp as he struggle to he foot and start towards the stair to follow sing . back to sing , move further down the hall . he get about halfway down it when we see a shot of he foot just at a trip -wire . over it be some cobweb hang down . he reach to part they , and step forward into the wire . as he step we see a shot of a shotgun with wire slowly pull down on the trigger . sing look up , and the trigger of that gun and six other shotgun point down directly at he fire . sing be hit , blood splattering against he and the wall . we see only from he shoulder down . he spasm for a moment , then fall forward to he knee . cut to tapp , who be make strange vowel sound , move down the flight of stair just before the hallway where sing now be . on he knee , sing remain upright for a moment , spasming more . we go to a shot of jigsaw on the floor . jigsaw start move and get himself up to he foot , and start hobbling further down the hall . sing body finally fall forward onto the floor , spasming still . tapp continue down the stair , fall against the wall a couple of time . we see jigsaw as he get to the end of the hall and start slide a large door open . at that moment , tapp reach the bottom of the stair and turn into the hallway , collapse back into a sit position on the stair . jigsaw hobble through the door and start to go leave . tapp sit up a bit and look down the hall , where he see sing , who have stop spasming . his eye widen , tapp remove the hand from he throat and reach forward towards sing , he mouth open and move but no sound other than some gasp come out . the shot fade to a slow - pace black and white , and then snap into a few crime scene photo of sing body , include a nice gory one of the top of he head , part of which be now miss . at the last photoflash , we cut back to a shot of tapp presently , sit on he couch . the shot show a good view of the scar across he neck . tapp ( weak , desperate ) have you ... have you on you knee . ( he sit forward , get some thing off the coffee table ) youre run . youre run ... ( he get up and go over to the desk in the corner with the audio recording device and dozen of photo pin to the wall , take a seat ) youre run scared because we have you . I m go to close this case . Ram close it . ( he pick up a small frame photograph , which we can nt see , but likely , it 's of sing . ) right , sing ? right ? were gonna close it , sing . lawrence X Marks the spot ... ( he stand , touch the pipe and look up and around a bit . ) X mark the spot ... we need to search this room again . ( he turn and look over at Adam . ) what be you do over there ? cut back into regular view in the bathroom , with a shot of Adam sit on the tub , hold the photograph of alison and diana just beneath the edge of the inside of the tub , look down at it . he ignore lawrence , flipping the photo over . lawrence ( irritate ) Excuse I ? adam ( glance up ; calm irritation ) just because I m stick in this room with you do nt mean I have to report to you every ten second . lawrence ( sigh ) I really do nt see the point in we not help one another . adam well what do you want I to do ? I m on a leash . lawrence that 's exactly why we need to talk . we need to think ! adam I be think ! lawrence ( snap at he ) well then do nt keep I in the dark about what youre think ! there be a pause as something about that statement strike Adam . adam turn off the light . lawrence what ? adam ( let the photo fall into the tub as he stand ) turn they off now , please ! lawrence ( do nt get it ) why ? adam ( impatiently ) just turn they off for a second ! lawrence stare at he oddly but move backwards , reach over and flipping off the light . Adam look around . lawrence look around too , but he see nothing . he do nt seem to think this be go to help any . then we see on the wall next to he a glow in the dark X paint on the tile . he do nt see it and shrug , but Adam spot it . adam Jesus , behind you ! lawrence ( turn and see it , be surprised ) how come we do nt see that before ? adam the light in here have nt charge it . it must be glow in the dark paint or something . lawrence turn and flip the light back on , both of they wince slightly at the sudden transition from dark to bright white , though not as much as before . lawrence lean over and pick up he hacksaw , go over to the tile where the X be and start hit the tile with the handle of the hacksaw . he break through , reach into a small cavity in the wall and pull out a small brown box with a hinge lid . he can nt believe it . he look to Adam , a small grin on he face . he place it on the floor and sit down behind it . adam ( excitedly ) open it ! lawrence ( turn it around so we and Adam can see the small lock on it . ) it 's lock . ( he pause , think , then realize something ) the key , the one from my envelope . where be it ? Adam look around he , then lean down , look on the floor for the key . adam ( soft , hushed tone as he look ) where the fuck ... here . ( he find it , pick it up and toss it over . ) lawrence pick up the key , try it on the lock . it work . he take the lock off , open the box . he hold up a cell phone , smile in relief . adam ( big smile ) cell phone . the most beautiful invention on this planet ! lawrence take out and hold up one of two cigarettes . Adam let out a joyful laugh . adam make that second most beautiful invention ! ( he reach out he hand for lawrence to toss it . ) give I that . lawrence be you joke ? youre gonna put something we find in this room in you mouth ? adam ( pause , then ) yes , I m willing to risk it ! give I that sweet cancer . ( lawrence ignore he request , toss out the other cigarette and a lighter . he find lastly a small fold up note with the word shh , Doctor , write on it . ) I do nt care , I really dont . give I one of that . jigsaws voiceover read what 's write on the note as lawrence open the paper and read it , keep it low in the box where Adam can nt see it . jigsaw ( vo ) the cigarettes be harmless , I promise . smoke be only poisonous when it end in bloodsh . think about this - you do nt need a gun to kill Adam . adam ( grow impatient ) May I please have a cigarette ? lawrence ( ignore he plea ) I m try the police . ( he flip open and dial on the cell phone , but a weird beep noise indicate the call can nt go through come from the phone . he dial again , same result . ) shit . ( pause , think . ) this be mean to receive call , not make they . ( a moment ; he realize something . ) wait a minute ... this have happen before . cut back to a overhead descend view inside a parking garage . lawrence ( vo ) last night , after I finish at the hospital . ( fade into another closer shot of the car , and lawrence walk down the corridor , carry he briefcase . ) I be walk back to my car . ( he stop a moment ) I think I be alone , but I m sure someone else be there . ( he squint , bring he hand up over he eye . there be a flash from the side . he look up , startle , look in the direction in which he think it come from , but see nothing . he look around he for another moment , then continue forward to he car . ) cut to a shot within a circular overhead mirror of lawrences car pull up to a abandon security gate station . he get out of the car , shutting the door and go over to a phone on the wall to dial security to let he out . when he dial , though , it give he a busy signal . as it beep , we cut to another shot of he car in the mirror . the back door on the passenger side start to slowly open . back to lawrence , who hang up the phone , aggravate , and reach into he pocket for he cell phone . he open it and dial . back in the mirror , we see something get out of the car on its hand and knee . it be in a red robe and have a strangely shape head with long , tangly dark hair . lawrence finish dial , hold the phone to he ear but receive the same beep tone as the phone in the bathroom , indicate that he cannot make outgo call . perplex , he hold up the phone , try to get a better signal . alongside the car , the thing move even closer now . it get up slowly . we see that it be wear the strange boar mask previously see in the flashback of jigsaws workshop . it suddenly rush upon he as heus distract with he phone and grab he . cut back to lawrence sit on the floor in the bathroom , still hold the phone . lawrence ( his eye distant , off in he memory ) that ... thing . it be wait for I . ( he exhales sharply , then look back up at Adam . Adam be just stand there , stare at he . something seem a bit ...off . with a suspicious tone , lawrence address he . ) how do you know to turn off the light ? adam who care ? it work . lawrence yeah , but how do you know ? adam ( a slight pause ) instinct . ( his tone be far from believable . ) lawrence ( do nt believe a word of it ) instinct ? adam yeah . lawrence you know what ? ( he look down , then back up at Adam . ) youre a terrible liar . adam ( quiet offense ) you say that like you know I . lawrence ( speak calmly , but anger lie underneath the surface ) what else be nt you tell I ? adam ( cocky and sarcastic ) well , um , letus see . on my sixth birthday , my best friend at that time , Scott tibbs , stab I with a rusty nail . I do nt tell you about that . I didnt tell you that my last girlfriend , ( lawrence lower he head into he hand . un-fucking - believable ) who be a feminist vegan punk , break up with I because she think I be too angry . uh , I have nt tell you that one of my toenail be slightly ... lawrence ( snap at he , feed up ) just stop it . you know to turn off this light . adam ( turn away from lawrence ) what -ever . lawrence ( stand up , frustrated . ) I m deal with a juvenile . adam ( have have it , look right at he ) you wanna know ? lawrence ( exasperate ) yeah ! Adam lean down and reach into the bathtub , pull out and hold up the picture of alison and diana . adam ( with a somewhat aggressive attitude ) here it be . ( he throw it towards lawrence , who look down at it , then back up at Adam before get down on the floor and pull it towards he with the hinge box . he pick it up , sit up as he look upon it with shock . ) lawrence ( very softly , shakily ) oh God ... ( he turn it over , then back . Adam cast he eye downward , still stand but cool off , feel bad for lawrence ) w... where do you get this ? adam ( softly ) it be in you wallet , behind the photo of you daughter . lawrence w... why do nt you show I this before ? adam I couldnt . ( lawrence begin to shakily sob , touch the photo . ) I m sorry . ( Adam go over and sit against a pipe in he corner , lowering he head and upper body forward , hold he head in he hand . ) lawrence sniffles , shaking , then look right to the surveillance camera behind the glass and scream . lawrence what be you do to they you bastard ?! ( he go back to huddle over the photograph , sniffle and cry for a moment . then , he sit up , try to pull himself together ) okay ...okay .. ( he look around a bit ) okay , I ve get to think now ... ( he look down , see the note again in the box . ) jigsaw ( vo ) think about this ... you do nt need a gun to kill Adam . when there 's that much poison in you blood ( a slow shot move to the pool of blood from the body in front of lawrence ) , the only thing leave to do be shoot yourself . lawrence look at the body , then down . he 's get a idea . he take a cigarette , glance over at Adam , who still have he head down in he hand . he dip the end of the cigarette in the blood , then put it back in the box . he start to get up . Adam look up , see he stand . adam what be you do ? lawrence go to the light , look at the camera , suddenly flip off the light . we see a shot of Zep startling when the light go out on the monitor , then we go back to the darken bathroom . adam hey ! what the hell be you do ? lawrence ( whisper so the surveillance camera will not pick he up ) Adam , listen to I . I want you to play along with I on this . Zep lean in , try to hear what 's be say , but the static of the video be too loud . he try to adjust the sound , but to no avail . shot go back into the bathroom , where lawrence be finish say something to Adam . lawrence you get that ? ( he turn the light back on , both of they again wince at the bright light . lawrence glance at the surveillance camera , then look to Adam . lawrence ( try to be nonchalant ) so you uh , still want that cigarette ? adam um ... yeah , sure . lawrence make a show of reach into the box where the poison cigarette be , but take the other un - dip one instead . he throw it to Adam , who reach down and pick it up from where it land . lawrence throw the lighter as well . Adam put the cigarette between he lip and reach down , pick up the lighter . he glance over at lawrence , who watch he intently . Adam just shrug then light up . he take a long drag , then exhales in a sigh of relief and with a smile . he take another drag then suddenly freeze , he head jerk and a strange gurgle sound come from he throat . his head jerk more then the rest of he body , he eye widen . his hand drop the cigarette and go to he throat as he turn , still jerky and make a strange , almost squeaky choke sound in he throat . the sound grow louder as he fall to he knee , then back a bit , he leave arm hold out in front of he dramatically . he fall backwards onto the floor , twitching some more , still choke . he let out a long cough , suddenly stop jerk , and close he eye . the death in its entirety be very , very fake . lawrence ( watch Adam , then turn to the surveillance camera , speak with angry finality ) there ! I ve do it ! I ve kill he with the poison , just like you want . ( shouting ) now where 's my family ?! where be they ?! suddenly , we go to a shot of Adam lie there and a loud , electrical buzzing sound be hear as he body jerk to life and he cry out . he spasm and jerk around as he be electrocute , and lawrence look upon he in shock . finally , the electrocution stop , and Adam sit up slightly , gasp , eye wide . adam ( he shriek in pain and shock ) Jesus Christ !! lawrences reaction be not one of concern ; he simply can nt believe that Adam just screw up the plan . lawrence ( disbelief ) what ? adam ( wide eye ) I just get electrocute ! lawrence what ? ( he roll he eye . unbelievable . he speak in a hushed tone . ) that be we way out ! Adam look at he in shock , cannot believe lawrence would think hed make something like that up . adam ( yell at he ) do you hear what I say ? ( he desperately grab at the manacle around he ankle , pull at it and shriek ) get this thing off I ! get it off ! lawrence ( piss off ) stop act ! adam ( stop pull at the manacle and chain ; now heus piss at lawrence for he disbelief ) you think I would make that up just to mess up you stupid fuck charade ? lawrence ( give up on Adam , frustrated once more ) all right , that 's it ! ( he lean over and pick up he see , sit down and start try to see through he chain again , grunt . Adam , in the meantime , just sit back against the wall , breathe heavily , look daze . lawrence continue to franticly see , but it do nt work . he get piss off and throw the blade down . ) ah , damn it !! back to Adam , still look daze . suddenly , a look of realization dawns upon he face . the electrocution have jogge he memory . adam ( wide - eye ) I remember everything now . ( lawrence glance over at he . ) I remember how I get here . flashback to Adam walk up the stair in he apartment building , a camera around he neck , smoking a cigarette and listen to music on he headphone . he walk with a uncare , slow swagger . he get to the top of the stair and walk down a red-lit hallway to he apartment . he go inside , close the door behind he then move into the kitchen area , throw he key onto the table and open the fridge . the entire apartment be very rundown , decrepit , dingy and old ; truly a shithole apartment as Adam describe it earlier . there be graffiti on the door and wall , the wallpaper be fade and peel , the refrigerator be dirty . Adam open the fridge and look inside for a moment . he sigh , then close the door . he head over to he darkroom , close the door behind he . the lighting be dark red . he put the camera down on the table , take the strap off from around he neck , take off he headphone and cd player , press stop and put they down off to the side . he sigh tiredly and go over to a tray where a photo be develop and pick it up with he finger , gang it with a closepin on a hang line with other photo . it be a picture of a man wear sunglass . the man be in fact lawrence . to the leave of that one be a shot of lawrence in the parking garage with he hand over he eye . the camera cut to a shot of the newest photo through a peephole in the darkroom door as the camera fade out and back , view the grafitty door of the darkroom before the shot fade to black , industrial music play over the shot . cut to Adam sleep in the now pitch - black darkroom , he head down on the table . he wake up abruptly , as though he have nt mean to fall asleep . he look around , confuse , wonder why all the light out . he give a great , another problem type of sigh . he stand and yawn , reach over for the lightswitch . he move it up and down a few time , but nothing happen . another aggravate sigh . he reach down and find a flashlight on the counter , press the on button but it do nt work . piss , he shake it hard , try to get it to come on , but that do nt work . he look at it , scoff . adam great . suddenly , he hear something move outside the door , somewhere in he apartment . on alert , he listen . he look down and pick up he camera , slinging it around he neck and hold it out in front of he . he open the creaky door into he also pitch - black apartment . he take a few step forward , speak nervously , but try to be brave . adam be someone there ? ( he take a picture , the flash lighting up the area in front of he . ) I can hear you . ( he take another picture , the flash lighting up a live room area . nothing yet . he move forward more , into the kitchen entryway , snap away for light . ) suddenly , from behind he , a evil doll laugh be hear . he startles , spin around . adam ( he voice alarmed but confuse at the same time ) what the ...? ( he snap a picture in its direction and see the puppet from jigsaws workshop and video sit in a armchair , continue its evil laugh . ) Christ ! ( he reach down and find a baseball bat on the floor , and start hit the doll as hard as he can until the laugh start to fade and then just die out . ) what the ... he hear the sound of movement again , come from just behind he in a closet . he go on alert again , hold up the baseball bat and the camera . adam who be that ?! who 's in there ?! ( he move towards the door , shaking but try to be a tough guy ) come on out ! ill kill you , you motherfucker ! ( he open the door , hold the camera and take a picture . as soon as the flash go off we see the red-robe pig thing that originally grab lawrence quickly move forward and grab Adam . ) suddenly , the cell phone ring . lawrence look down at it in slight surprise . Adam snap out of he daze to look at it as well . lawrence glance over at Adam and then carefully reach down , pick it up and answer it . the scene will cut back and forth to diana and alison in the room and lawrence on the phone for the duration of the conversation . lawrence ( not sure what to expect ) who be this ? diana ( on the phone , sobbing ) daddy ? lawrence diana ? ( he stand ) diana daddy , be that you ? ( cut to a shot of she be hold by Zep , the phone to she ear . ) lawrence ( get sniffly ) yeah baby , it 's I . I m here .
