( type consist of hold a long wooden stylus and tapping either end down different column of chinese character on she desktop screen . ) she be a good two year young than the other kid . river people do not like to be meddle with . we tell they what to do , what to think , do not run do not walk we be in they home and in they head and we have not the right . we be meddlesome . teacher ( gently take she stylus ) River , we be not tell people what to think . we be just try to show they how . she violently plunge the stylus into the girl 's forehead int . lab - night and we flash CUT to the actual present : a 16 year old river sit in a metal chair , needle stick in she skull ( one right where the teacher have stick she ) be adjust by a technician . a second monitor she brain pattern . the lab be cold , blue , steel . insidiously clean . 2 nd technician she 's dream . first technician nightmare ? 2 nd technician off the chart . scary monster . doctor mathias let 's amp it up . delcium , eight - drop . doctor mathias be not instantly likable -- nor gradually , for that matter . a cold man , and more than a little satisfied with himself . 4 . behind he stand a government inspector , observe . and make he a little nervous . the Inspector be in shadow , but he uniform indicate -- no substantial rank , as do the eagle - crest baton longer than a ruler -- that he clutches in one glove hand . doctor mathias ( continuing ) see , most of we best work be do when they be asleep . we can monitor and direct they subconscious , implant suggestion ... River start convulse , mew in misery . the Inspector start forward , slowly . doctor mathias ( continuing ) it 's a little startling to see , but the result be spectacular . especially in this case . River Tam be we star pupil . the Inspector step into the light . he be rigid , cold , stare at the girl with no emotion at all . his name , as we will very soon learn , be simon . simon I have hear that . doctor mathias she 's a genius . her mental capacity be extraordinary , even with the side -effect . simon tell I about they . doctor mathias well , obviously , she 's unstable ... the neural stripping give they heighten cognitive reception , but it also destabilize they own reality matrix . it manifest as borderline schizophrenia ... which at this point be the price for be truly psychic . simon ( move toward she ) what use do we have for a psychic if she 's insane ? J 5 . doctor mathias I do not have to tell you the security potential of someone who can read mind . and she have lucid period -- we hope to improve upon the ... I be sorry , Sir , I have to ask if there 's some reason for this inspection . simon ( turning ) be I make you nervous ? doctor mathias Key member of parliament have personally observe this subject . I be tell they support for the project be unanimous . the demonstration of she power -- simon ( turn back to she ) how be she physically ? doctor mathias like nothing we have see . all we subject be condition for combat , but River ... she 's a creature of extraordinary grace . 400 simon yes . she always do love to dance . he drop to one knee , slamm he baton to the floor . angle : the baton as the top pop off like a bounce betty ( the grenade ) , fly up over Simon and River 's head and then burst forth in a flat circle of blue energy that bisect the room , flow through the staff 's head and knock they out . Simon rush to River , gently remove the probe from she head and swab she , whisper : simon ( continuing ) River . wake up . please , it 's Simon . River . it 's you brother . wake up ... she begin to stir as a noise move he to the door , look out and remove he uniform to reveal a orderly 's tunic beneath . iwo 6 . River be suddenly next to he . he jump a little . river Simon . a beat , as they face each other , Simon fight emotion . river ( continuing ) they know you have come . int . guard station - continuing as a guard look at a monitor . he mostly resemble a secret service man -- more bureaucrat than thug . a second man roll into frame on a chair behind he , also watch the screen . int . research CENTER corridor - continuing Simon walk River through the corridor . they approach a pair of double door . simon we can not make it to the surface from inside . Simon turn suddenly as he hear footstep , people head at they from the other side of the door . 4wo simon ( continuing ) find a -- but River have , impossibly , scampere up over some lab equipment to the dark top of the corridor , where she hold herself in a perfect split , foot against the wall and outstretch hand hold the sprinkler for support . the door burst open and two doctor pass by , hardly notice the lone orderly . pass right under River . ext . ventilation shaft - moment later it 's small , 15 foot by 15 foot . go a long way up and a long way down . one wide hinge window look in on the hall inside . Simon and River approach with quiet haste . they slip through the window . Simon shut it , wedge he baton into the handle as the security agent approach . they fire at the glass , but they laser have no effect . wind whip River 's hair about as she look up to see a small patch of daylight visible ten storey up . see the sky blott out by a small ship that hover above they . v0 7 . angle : the ship be float over the grass of roll hill , the city gleam far beyond . this facility be well hide . a gurney -size section of the ship 's belly detach and drop down ten storey , cable spool it out of the ship . it come to Simon and River and stop suddenly . simon get on ! he be stand by the window -- and the Security agent be right behind he , punching the window with all he might . Simon help River onto the gurney , then jump on himself as the Security agent crack the glass . the two be whisk up in the gurney , River on she knee , Simon stand beside she hold one of the cable -- the operative ( o.s. ) stop . the action freeze . the operative ( 0.s . ) ( continuing ) Lovely . Lovely . backtrack . the action reverse , take we back to the moment of Simon and River on the gurney just before it rise . for t of the operative ( o.s . ) ( continuing ) stop . there be a motionless beat , River freeze in that crouch , and he step through what we now see be a hologram of the event . the government 's man . we will just call he the operative . he be thoughtful , a little remove . Wire - rimmed glass , a suit too nondescript to be a uniform , too neat to be casual wear . he be in : int . institute record room - day -- which be long and bare but for drawer of holographic record , a set - up for watch recording ( where the image of Simon and River float ) , and a table with computer and chair . the operative cross to the table , look over some papers . the operative biograph .

Doctor Mathias storm in , two security man ( not the one from the open ) and a nervous young female intern follow . Mathias look greyer and more gaunt than when we see he last . doctor mathias Excuse I ! no one be allow in the record room without my express permission . the operative ( over this , quietly ) enter the doctor . ( to Mathias ) forgive I . I prefer to see the event alone , without bias . Mathias look at the hologram -- realize which one it be . doctor mathias I need to see you clearance . the operative you be right to insist . I know you have have security issue here . he place he hand on a screen as he say it . Mathias look at the readout , and drop the bluster . doctor mathias apology . a operative of the parliament will of course have full cooperation . ( look at screen ) I be not sure what ...

Mathias bolt but the operative pin he to the wall . he bunch he finger and jab the side of the Doctor 's spine . Mathias stiffen , suddenly , agonizingly immobile . the operative step back , observe the Doctor 's rigid grimace for a moment . almost ceremoniously , he drop to one knee and hold the blade out to one side , hilt to the floor and point tilt toward the doctor . the Doctor stare at it in horror as he paralyze body begin to tip over toward it . the operative turn toward the terrify intern at the door . v0 12 . the operative ( continuing ) Young miss , I will need all the log - on behavioral modification triggers . we will have to reach out to River Tam , and help she to come back to we . no matter how far out Simon have take she , we can -- he 's almost startle when the Doctor 's body drop into frame , slowed suddenly by the sword . it squeak down the blade , the Doctor unable to cry out , as the operative whisper to he : the operative ( continuing ) this be a good death . there 's no shame in this , in a man 's death . a man who 's do fine work . we be make a better world . all of they , better world .
