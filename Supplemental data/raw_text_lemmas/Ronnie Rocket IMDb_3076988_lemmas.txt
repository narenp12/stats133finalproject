Black . . . fade in a giant stage . . . enormous with black cur - tain -- open . the entire stage be fill with a wall of fire 200 foot high . within the fire be thousand of soul scream out silently . . . only the roaring of the fire . fade out there be a dark land where mystery and confusion abound , where fear and terror fly together in troubled city of absurdity . Black cloud race by over a soot - cover city , where it be dark - est night . only a few tiny yellow square of light in the old building and factory . everything be so dark . very little life be notice except the tiny dark yellow square . there be no car see from this high angle look down over the city -- no people out this night . a closer look at some of the building reveal a thirty style architecture , although quite plain and very massive . Office building with heavy industrial factory . a smoke stack pour ton of heavy black smoke slowly and silently into the dark night sky . hundred of heavy electrical wire crisscross through the sky and electricity hum come from giant box on the pole . the headlight and then a car -- it move slowly below , down a street then turn out of signt . a old neon sign over a diner say " City diner . " a large old hospital and the , front step . Inside a nurse go by wheeling a patient on a roll bed . the corridor be now empty . move slow through the empty corridor . a open steel door . down now two flight of cement stair and along a dark and moist corridor off of which sit decaye subterranean hospital room . we hear the heavy machinery that keep the massive building ope - rating . pipe leak rusted fester water into puddle on the cold floor . enter one of this small decaye room we see a old hospital bed . a dim name tag on the end of the bed bear the name ronald do arte . in the bed , under the white sheet , lay ronald do arte who , because of some strange unnamed happen be now here quite dis - figure . there be no human form to he really except he do have arm and leg , but they be under the sheet . the chest and head area be very strangely shape , but there be a hole for a mouth and a nose . in the mouth there be tooth and a tongue which move . there be two eye above the nose hole . the eye dart back and forth . suddenly , and quite mysteriously there be a detective now stand in this room . he wear black pants and shoe , a white shirt , a black jacket which be now hang on a rack over against the cement wall . over he shirt , he wear leather strap and a shoulder holster which support a .38 pistol under he arm . he be stand , look at the hospital bed . Ronald De arte ' be now make some sound -- very high pitch whine and be attempt to reach a piece of paper which lie on a moveable steel tale next to he bed . the detective move in closer and hand the paper to Ronald who contort in order to get he arm over to it . more high pitch whine and a knock of he hand on the table near a pencil which leap with every hit let the detective know that Ronald now require a pencil with which to write . Ronald very shakily scribbles out the follow symbol and all the while he make very long , high pitch whine : [ image ] the detective take the paper to a small lamp across thdy room and look the symbol over . he fold the paper and continue to hold it as he turn toward Ronald again . he come up closer to Ronald . Ronald make some more noise . the detective now be very close to Ronald look into he eye . very faintly the big close up of Ronald stay double expose as the detective turn , get he coat and go quickly out of the room . put on he coat he look suspiciously , leave and right down the dark - corridor - - no one - - he go down the hall and disappear around the corner . no one be on the street as he cross it to a large building where he stop and turn back to see if anyone be follow - ing he . he look carefully all around he . satisfied with the situation as it be , he turn back again and go down the street into the darkness . Ronald 's cu fade . now the detective be in a train station . several people be board a black steel train in a dimly light passenger load area . the detective climb aboard and find a seat . even with the light on it be still so dimly light . the cigar and cigarette smoke be very thick . people talk but not too audibly because the train and station sound be so loud . it be a dull crowd of very poor work - class people . the train begin to move and rumble through the night . at the first station nearly every - one let off . a arcing of electricity and on again to the next station which appear to be the last because everyone get off except the detective . the people hurry through the underground station than all be desert . the train continue to make sound but do not move . a conductor appear and find the detective still aboard . conductor ( speak loudly ) off the train !!! detective I want to go deeper into the city . I be a detective . conductor you a detective ? detective yes . conductor train do not go far into the city . . . can only go one , maybe two , more station . . . close up beyond that . . . no one . you want to go , but only one , maybe two , station . detective can I get another train to go further ? conductor no more train ever beyond here never go . . . now three people . ( look up with a " now this be curious " expression ) at this , two strange look people slowly enter the train car from the other end and begin come toward the detective and the conductor . conductor con 't ' board !!! the conductor leave the car and the other two sit down and look at the detective , then at each other , then down at the floor , then up at the detective . outside the conductor yell something which echoe in the back - ground , then someone way far away yell . the conductor yell again and the train begin to move very slowly ahead with much grind metal sound . streak along the train move into even heavier darkness . occasionally a light can be see outside the window but mostly all be black . the light in the train dim down lower as a hum sound come from above the train . the train slow and enter a station . this station be empty and very old . it look completely un -use . paper and dirt be blow through - out , window be break , and most of the light be out . the outside be suddenly light up considerably by a huge electrical arcing of the wiring on the train . it stop and the light inside come up slightly . the conductor walk quickly into the car and as he go by the three of they : conductor bad repair . . . electrical spark ! outside the electricity arc again and the train jump forward . it move along slowly and the giant hum sound be now con - tant . the train go through darkness then come to a area where there be some lightbulb strung on wire and then the train slow to a grind halt . the two across from the detec - tive leave the train as the conductor walk in . conductor end of the line . detective be this the station ? conductor no one use the station . . . all that 's leave . we have train trouble now . . . a bad place . get off the train now . . . this be the end of the line . from here on you be on you own , bub ! the detective step off the train and the train begin back up out of sight . the detective stand near a bulb . moth fly against the bulb . . . over and over again they hit at it , try - inz , to get at the light . the detective watch the moth . there be noise , the detective turn . he be surround by snarl - ing black dog circle he -- move closer . the detective freeze with fear . now out of the darkness come a group of man wear black woolen overcoat , black hat , glove and boot . they stamp they foot up and down as they slowly surround and move in closer to the detective . they join with the dog and become like the moth around the light bulb . suddenly like animal they attack and quickly beat the detective to the ground . one of the man " zap " the detective with a huge electrical jolt from a elect - rical hand gun which be shape like a cattle prod . the detective do not move . they continue to circle . they " zap " he again and the ground begin to smoke . now laugh they storm off into the night with the dog . the detective strain to open he eye and maintain consciousness . detective ( outloud to himself ) what have happen to this place ? now out of the darkness come a old man , terry . in fact , one of the two people that travel on the train with the detective . he be a older man-- rather mean look and wear one pant leg roll up expose a gauze bandage . he carry a fly swatter with he and from time , swat he sore leg at the bandage . when the sore be particularly act up , Terry turn the swatter around and dig under the bandage with the wire handle . now Terry circle the detective slowly - - eyeing he . terry get up . . . get up here outa the light . . .
