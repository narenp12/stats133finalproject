year one written by harold ramis , gene stupnitsky &amp ; Lee eisenberg October 18th , 2007 in the beginning ... 1 black a infinite void but at the center a singularity , a particle infinitely small and infinitely dense that contain all the potential matter and energy in the universe . the big bang a blind flash of light as the singularity explode , particle expand in all direction until they fill the screen , a shimmer cloud of electromagnetic dust . then the particle start to attract one another to form atom , the atom element , the element form molecule , the molecule compound , the compound cell , then a cell twitches and a primitive drum start booming out a dolby heartbeat as we witness the rapid evolution of organism . then a big fish swim by and be suddenly swallow whole by a much bigger fish , and we rapidly rise from the depth and pull back to reveal -- the sea 2 vast , blue , roll toward the shore , brilliant sun rise in a cloudless azure sky . a woman emerge from the sea like Aphrodite , strongly backlit to obscure she nudity , but we can see she be full - breast , long -limb , tone and tan -- perfection . then a man rise up out of the water beside she , and stagger clumsily in the surf . even in silhouette we can see he 's far from perfect -- short , overweight . they turn to each other and embrace . it 's paradise -- for he . the woman ( look deep in he eye ) I be so hungry . the man ( want she ) yeah . I , too . the drum get hotter as he close he eye and lean in to kiss she , but she turn and walk away . woman what should we eat ? the man oh , you actually mean you be hungry . I think -- forget it . official White 2 . he follow she . they walk toward the tree that fringe the beach . when they reach the line of vegetation , the woman , maya , kneel , pull berry from a bush and pop they in she mouth . the man , zed , grab a handful of berry and they squat there nosh like Adam and Eve . the woman mmmm , this be so good . the man mmrrunm , they really be . when she turn away he spit they out in disgust . Maya smile and put she face very close to he , they lip almost touch . maya ( very sexy ) you know what I would really like ? zed ( hopefully ) what ? maya some fruit . zed ( frustrated , but hang in ) yeah , fruit 's good . ( he stand up ) you want a apple or a pear ? maya ( thinks ) no . he scan the nearby tree . zed Orange ? tangerine ? ( she shake she head ) umm , mango ? Kiwi ? Peach ? she shake she head coyly . he start darting from tree to tree , hopefully point out various option . she follow he . official White 3 . zed ( cont would ) plum ? nectarine ? Passion fruit ? maya ( coquettishly ) nuh-uh . zed ( fake smile ) okay , do not tell I -- papaya ? pomegranate ? lemon ? lime ? kumquat ? uh , cock ? cockfruit ? maya nooo -- the game be no longer cute but he still play along . zed watermelon ? honeydew ? grape ? maya nooo -- zed ( this be a lot of work to get laid ) starfruit , casaba - - tangelo ? maya nope . zed ( he do not even like she anymore ) okay , I give up . which fruit do you want ? maya ( point ) that one . Zed look . it 's a beautiful tree with lush , apple-like red fruit hang from it . zed ( scoff ) yeah , right . okay . maya why not ? official white 4 . zed because that 's the fruit we do not eat ! it 's forbidden . maya why not ? zed because we do not ! it 's a rule ! that 's the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil . you do not eat from that one . nobody ever have . maya why not ? zed stop say why not ! I tell you -- it 's a rule . maya so do you always follow the rule ? zed no -- yeah -- I do not know . we do not have that many rule . in fact , we only have one rule -- don't eat that fruit . maya okay , fine . we will not . forget I mention it . I understand if you be afraid -- zed I be not " afraid " -- maya no , really , it 's all right . I just think you might be curious why we can eat everything else that walk , crawl , swim , fly , or grow in the ground , but not that particular fruit . and I think you might be the kind of man who 's willing to take a chance and start think for himself , but I guess I be wrong . she glare defiantly at Zed , then start to walk away . it 's not paradise anymore . then like every man that ever live and will ever live , he cave . official White 5 . zed okay ! Fine ! you want to try the good and evil fruit , you get it . he rip two ripe fruit from a low-hanging bough and hand she one . they both stare at the fruit . maya you first . zed no way ! it be you idea . you go first . maya we both bite at the same time . Zed consider for a long moment then decide . zed okay . ready ? one -- two -- three !
