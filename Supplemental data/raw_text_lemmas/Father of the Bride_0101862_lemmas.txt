Father of the bride scene 1 GEORGE I use to think a wedding be a simple affair . a boy and girl meet , they fall in love , he busy a ring , she busy a dress , they say " I do . " I be wrong . that 's get marry . a wedding be a entirely different proposition . I know . I have just be through one . not my own . my daughter 's . Annie bank -mackenzie . that 's she marry name . mackenzie . I will be honest with you . when I buy this house seventeen year ago , it cost I less than this bless event in which Annie bank become Annie bank - mackenzie . I be tell that one day I will look back on all this with great affection and nostalgia . I hope so . you father will understand . you have a little girl . a adorable little girl who look up to you and adore you in a way you could never imagine . I remember how she little hand use to fit inside mine . how she use to sit in my lap and lean she head against my chest . she say that I be she hero . then the day come when she want to get she ear pierce and she want you to drop she off a block before the movie theater . next thing you know she 's wear eye shadow and high heel . from that moment on , you be in a constant state of panic . you worry about she go out with the wrong kind of guy , the kind of guy who only want one thing -- and you know exactly what that one thing be because it 's the same thing you want when you be they age . then she get a little older and you quite worry about she meeting the wrong guy and you worry about she meeting the right guy . and that 's the biggest fear of all because then you lose she . and before you know it , you be sit all alone in a big , empty house , wear rice on you tux , wonder what happen to you life . it be just six month ago that it happen here . just six month ago that the storm break . scene 2 GEORGE ( vo ) Annie have be study for she Masters in Architecture for the past semester in Rome .

GEORGE at we favorite restaurant . the place we have be eat at for fifteen year . the best . the Steak pit ! annie dad , get serious . matt I do not think you want the word " pit " on a wedding invitation , George . annie really , dad . a rib joint with sawdust on the floor be not exactly what I have in mind for my wedding . no offense . GEORGE well , excuse I . what do you have in mind ? the beverly Hills Hotel ? annie no. actually , what I would like to have be my wedding in a church and have the reception here . that 's what I be hope for . GEORGE here ? ( GEORGE visualize reception barbecue in the backyard --vo : here 's the bride burger and groom burger , and uh , go on over and see the juggler ! annie : a dream wedding ! a barbecue wedding ! ) this be a better idea than the Steak pit ! annie yeah . GEORGE we will get some picnic table and crepe paper and balloon ... you know , and invite all we best pal ... I will make my famous guacamole ... a wedding at home ... this be a great idea . scene 15 nina great idea . picnic table , crepe paper , balloon ... you at the barbecue ... oh , George ... GEORGE what do not you like about that ? nina why have you be act so crazy since the moment Annie tell you she be get marry ? GEORGE I have not be act crazy .

George , a wedding be a big deal . everybody seem to understand this but you . and as a matter of fact , now do not go nut when I tell you this , but when Brian 's Mom call with they list , she suggest that they might just want to pitch in and help with the cost of the wedding . GEORGE no. hey ! we may not have a house the size of rhode Island but we be not poverty stricken . we can certainly afford to give we daughter a proper wedding . nina proper ? not you in a chef 's hat , right George ? GEORGE who say anything about a chef 's hat ? when do this come up ? nina yeah , but I know you . I be close . oh look , I just really see this whole thing differently .

GEORGE it 's a blender . annie yeah . exactly . I mean , I do not want to act throw or anything , but inside I be .

I mean , what be this ? 1958 ? give the little wife a blender ? I mean , it scared I , you know ? in term of he expectation . I start to freak out and he ask I what be wrong and I ask he what a gift like this be suppose to be tell I and he say nothing and I do not believe he and we get into this big fight . and he say I be overreact . and I say why would I overreact ? nobody in my family overreact . and then , he come up with this totally absurd story , this completely outrageous lie and I be look at he and I be think , this man 's a liar ! GEORGE what do he lie about ? annie oh , actually it be something about you . GEORGE I ? annie he say the day that you and Mom go to go visit he folk ... this be so ridiculous ! he say that you be snooping around he dad 's desk and you somehow find he dad 's bankbook ... oh no ! first he say you break some mirror in they bathroom . and then you find he dad 's bankbook and you somehow throw it in they pool . I mean , it 's too ridiculous . the man lie ! GEORGE come in . nina Annie , Brian 's downstairs . annie I do not want to see he . nina he look awful . annie good . GEORGE Excuse I . GEORGE ( vo ) I think maybe I should help smooth thing over . so I take Brian out for a drink . I think we could have a talk ... scene 31 GEORGE ( vo ) ... man to man . but as I sit there and listen to he side of the story , I realize this be a golden opportunity . if I ever want to get rid of Brian mackenzie , this be my chance . brian you know that banana shake she like to make , right ? well , that 's why I think she would like a blender . I guess I can see she point . a blender do suggest a certain 1950 's reference to sexual politics . but I swear it never enter my consciousness at the time . GEORGE I believe you . brian you do ? would you tell Annie that for I , dad ? GEORGE ( vo ) this be where I be go to lower the boom . but instead , I find myself look into he weepy eye and find myself say ... GEORGE sure , I will tell she . brian oh good . ' Cause I know that whatever you say , she will believe . GEORGE ( vo ) not only be I not get rid of the kid , I now find myself talk he into stay . GEORGE you know , Brian ... Annie be a very passionate person and passionate people tend to overreact at time . Annie come from a long line of major overreactor . me. I can definitely lose it . my mother ... a nut . my grandfather ... storey about he be legendary . the good news , however , be that this overreact tend to get proportionately less by generation , so you kid could be normal . GEORGE ( vo ) as if that be not enough , I go on ! GEORGE but on the upside , with this passion come great spirit and individuality which be probably one of the reason you love Annie . brian that 's what I love most about she . GEORGE ( vo ) that 's when it hit I like a Mac truck . Annie be just like I , and Brian be just like Nina . scene 32 GEORGE ( vo ) they be a perfect match . annie dad , I can not believe you take he out . what do he say ? I mean , you do not have to tell I . what ? GEORGE honey , I just spend a hour with Brian and believe I when I tell you that this gift say nothing about how he feel about you . it 's just a thing to put in the kitchen . he think you might want to blend something one day and that 's all . annie and you believe that ? GEORGE completely . he 's downstairs now . his heart be break . please go see he . and also , that story he tell you about I and the bankbook and the swim pool ... annie yeah ? what ? GEORGE it 's true . annie oh Brian . brian oh Annie . I be so sorry about the blender . I see you point . it be incredibly insensitive of I . annie no ... it 's okay .
