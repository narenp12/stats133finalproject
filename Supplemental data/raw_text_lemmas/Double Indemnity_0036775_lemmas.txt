I say we could go to court . I do not say we want to . not only be it against we practice , but it would involve a great deal of expense , a lot of lawyer , a lot of time , perhaps year . Phyllis rise coldly . norton so what I want to suggest be a compromise on both side . a settlement for a certain sum , a part of the policy value -- phyllis do not bother , Mr. norton . when I come in here I have no idea you owed I any money . you tell I you do . then you tell I you do not . now you tell I you want to pay I a part of it , whatever it be . you want to bargain with I , at a time like this .

Fifteen mile a hour . now how could anybody jump off a slow move train like that with any kind of expectation that he would kill himself ? no soap , Mr. norton . we be sink , and we be go to pay through the nose , and you know it . May I have this ? key ' throat be dry after the long speech . he grab the glass of water out of norton 's hand and drain it in one big gulp . norton be watch he almost stupefy . neff stand with the shadow of a smile on he face . key put the glass down noisily on norton 's desk . keye come on , walter . norton do not move or speak . key put he hat on and cross towards the door , neff after he . with the doorknob in he hand key turn back to norton with a glance down at he own shirt sleeve . keye next time I will rent a tuxedo . they go out . dissolve to : c-5 neff - at dictaphone - ( night ) there be a tired grin on he face as he talk into the horn . neff I could have hugge you right then and there , key , you and you statistic . you be the only one we be really scared of , and instead you be almost play on we team ... dissolve to : c-6 neff.s apartment - evening - almost dark in the room the corridor door open let light in . neff enter with he hat on and he briefcase under he arm . he switch the light on , close the door , put the light on , close the door , put the key in he pocket . at this moment the telephone ring . he pick up the phone . neff.s voice that evening when I get home my nerve have ease off .
