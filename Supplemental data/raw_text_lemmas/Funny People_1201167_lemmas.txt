GEORGE that 's insulting . do not take out you frustration on I because you can not get laid by act like I be some sort of deviant . I be a adult . I have adult sexual relationship . no one do what they do not want to do . sex be how people decide if they like each other . I be testing my compatibility by ass -raping they . 77 . ira see , you can not do it . you can not even entertain the idea of get to know somebody for a month before sleep with they . GEORGE that 's not true . I be bored of sex , anyway . there be literally no body - part / orifice combination I have not experiment with . there be nothing leave to do . there be no nationality I have not . sleep with , no age group I have not sleep with .

GEORGE see ? that 's why I still drive a big truck . I stop drive that truck and that factory shut down . " 79 rachel ( not smile ) I know you be joke , but it 's a very serious situation . people like you do a lot of damage to the environment . whether it 's take a private jet by yourself , or get drive around town limo around town or live in you gas-guzzle house . you carbon footprint be huge .
