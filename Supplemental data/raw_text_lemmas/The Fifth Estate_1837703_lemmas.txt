SMALL apartment , bedroom - australia , 1984 - day a small room . 13 - year-old julian sit on a bed , toweling he hair dry in front of a commodore 64 , a box of floppy disk . daniel ( o.c. ) I guess everyone have secret . scar . moment in time that shape they . he pull off the towel , revealing a SHOCK of white hair . the submission platform - night Julian pace alone , enraged , in the shadow of the bonfire . we crane up as he pace , make figure eights in the sand ... daniel ( o.c. ) some we can get past ... ... and as we pull back , we notice child , dance 'round the bonfire , reaching up for the fiery , float doc ... daniel ( o.c. ) ( continued ) some we can not . int . all night cafe - berlin , germany - night the cafe where Daniel and Julian take on julius baer . Daniel stare at a empty table , and for a moment he see ... julian and himself , exhilarated , working on julius baer . the moment that shape he , one he wonder if he will get past . daniel we be really something , you know ? we could have do so much ... the image fade and Daniel look down , devastate . reveal Nick with he , take note . he stop , take off he glass . nick davie you know , there be a time when papers in Britain could not report on parliamentary debate . and then a few man start printing pamphlet , leak the debate to the public . the man , well , I believe they be hang , but the public see that pamphlet and demand access . ( then ) of course , the pamphleteer that follow overwhelm we tiny isle with rhetoric and distortion ... but this man , this brave and irresponsible man ... they be the father of the modern fourth estate . Daniel look up . Nick lean in . nick davie ( continued ) the great flood be once again upon we . a new information revolution , this one infinitely more powerful and terrifying than the last . a... fifth estate ... seemingly hell bent on destroy its predecessor . which be why we need more responsible man ... ( off Daniel ) ... man of purpose ... to harness its power , to lead we into the future . Daniel take that in , then -- nick davie ( continued ) Daniel , you and Julian give we a glimpse of what the future could be . you wake up the world , democracy and dictatorship alike should be on notice , two techno dreamer -- flash to -- real footage of the tunisian and egyptian uprising ... nick davie ( o.c. ) ( continued ) have give we the voice , have show we we have the power ... real video footage of occupy wall STREET . nick davie ( o.s. ) ( continued ) ...to demand the wave of information that , one day soon ... flash back to nick -- nick davie ( continued ) ... will wash all they evil away . Daniel take that in . move . daniel so . where should we start ? nick davie most good storey start at the beginning . Daniel nod . then , as he start to tell we story , we ... fade to black . text appear on screen . in 2010 , the Guardian and the Times publish a series of article on the US diplomatic cable . activist around the world greet this report with great enthusiasm . intercut with : int . ecuadorian embassy - day Julian sit for a interview , talk straight to camera . julian we be not anti-american . we value be that of jefferson and madison and if the cost of revolution like we have see in tunisia , in Cairo , if the cost be that for a little while some foreign leader be go to be a bit cautious when speak to the U.S. State Department , then that be clearly a cost that bounce in favor of what people need . as we continue , we intercut the interview with text card -- in 2011 , over the objection of the Guardian , the Times and numerous human rights group , wikileak publish all 251,287 cable in they original form . without redaction . by some estimate , the unredacted cable expose over 2000 confidential source around the world . julian ( continued ) that have always happen in the history of the world . we be take on powerful group that have vast and powerful lobby to support they . so of course we be go to be attack in all sort of manners . of course people be go to try and capitalize and distort and hype up any sort of possible criticism . after Daniel leave wikileak in 2010 , swedish prosecutor issue a warrant for Julian 's arrest , accuse he of two count of sexual molestation and one count of rape . Julian claim he do not know the woman . julian ( continued ) my goodness . I know mainstream media be biased , but this be absurd . the charge be without basis and they issue be deeply disturbing . I have be warn that , for example , the Pentagon plan to use dirty trick to spoil thing for we . Julian later admit to have sleep with both woman , but deny any wrongdo . he subsequently seek asylum and be now live in the ecuadorian embassy in London . julian ( continued ) as a organization , clearly we have make mistake . there be perhaps certain individual -- a individual we employ that perhaps we should not have employ ... that 's probably the great mistake . after leave wikileak , Daniel publish a book about he time there . wikileak threaten to take legal action . julian ( continued ) he be excitable . he become unstable , ambitious . reckless . that 's why he be suspend . in 2010 , Daniel announce plan for open leak , a new whistleblowing website . the site have yet to launch . julian ( continued ) the wikileak movie ? which one ? ( then ) that one ? it 's base on the worst two book . full of lie and distortion , like all bad propaganda . ( then ) the wikileak Movie ? more like the anti-Wikileak movie . ( then ) you want to know the truth ? no one be go to tell you the whole truth . they will only tell you they version . you want the truth , you have to seek it out for yourself . ( and then ) that 's where real power lie , you willingness to look past this story , any story . as long as you keep search , you be dangerous to they . that 's what they be afraid of . you . it be all about you . fade to black . scene : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 release of wikileak internal memo on the fifth estate wikileak have decide to release this internal talk point memo to the public alongside the script , because it represent a frank internal appraisal of the dreamwork film , the fifth estate , and what be wrong with it . this document be now issue to media during publicity for the film , which be due for general release on 18 October , 2013 . the point below represent how wikileak believe it should have be portray in the film , and why the film be , from wikileak 's perspective , irresponsible , counterproductive and harmful . talk point on the fifth estate wikileak have multiple version of the script wikileak have multiple version of the script for the fifth estate from several different source . the most recent script release to the public be a mature version , obtain at a late stage during the principal photography of 2013 . some of the attendee at the film premiere in Toronto on 5 September , 2013 be friend and supporter of wikileak and be able to compare the final product to the most recently obtain script . in the finish film , the script scene set in Iran have be transplant to Libya , but serve the same plot function . besides this , there have be no significant change . wikileak ' knowledge of the film be accurate and current , and we official position be well - found and base in fact . director Bill condon be therefore mistaken when he say : [ assange ] get hold of a very , very early draft of the script , which he have comment on , which really bear little resemblance to the movie we make . wikileak cause no harm to anyone the fifth estate falsely imply that wikileak harme 2,000 US government informant . not even the US government allege that wikileak cause harm to a single person . apologist for US government misconduct try to argue that wikileak cause harm to distract attention away from the serious storey come out of wikileak ' disclosure . but despite spend million of dollar over three year in preparation for the trial of private man , the US government be unable to present any evidence of anyone come to harm as a consequence of the wikileak publication . US brig . Gen. Robert carr - who be task to investigate this matter by the Pentagon - in fact state under oath when examine by the defense counsel that there be no harm whatsoever . as Defense Secretary Robert Gates say in 2010 : be this embarrassing ? yes . be it awkward ? yes . consequence for U.S. foreign policy ? I think fairly modest . the fifth estate be a work of fiction masquerade as fact the film be fictional . most of the event depict never happen , or the people show be not involved in they . it have real name , real place , and look like it be cover real event , but it be still a dramatic and cinematic work , and it invent or shape the fact to fit its narrative goal . there be very high stake involved in how wikileak be perceive . this film do not occur in a historical vacuum , but appear in the context of ongoing effort to bring a criminal prosecution against wikileak and Julian assange for expose the activity of the Pentagon and the US State Department . the film also occur in the context of pvt. man 's upcoming appeal and request for a presidential pardon . people should not in any way treat this film as a historical account of wikileak , its activity or its personnel . hopefully , they will be inspire to approach the topic with a open mind , and to support wikileak . even that work on the fifth estate say it have a agenda the star of the fifth estate , benedict cumberbatch , state that director Bill condon want he to play Julian assange as a " antisocial megalomaniac " : reading a early version of the script , which be partly adapt from Daniel domscheit - berg 's memoir of work with assange , cumberbatch realize that some of assange 's fear be justified . " on a lot of the stage direction , we collide path because Bill do seem to be set he up as this antisocial megalomaniac . " -- vogue cumberbatch worried that there be a agenda to make assange a " cartoon baddie " : when cumberbatch first read the script , he worried that it cast assange as some kind of cartoon baddie . " I think I may get my head bitten off by Disney for say so , but everyone agree with that . " -- the Guardian the fifth estate be only one side of the story the fifth estate be base on two book , both write by people who have personal and legal dispute with wikileak . this be personally biased source and be now outdated by three year . they tell only one side of the story . this author have a interest in portray Julian assange as dishonest or manipulative for competitive , personal and legal reason . it be hard to imagine how a film which aim to dramatise only they version of event could genuinely aspire to be fair or accurate . the film do not tell the story Julian assange or wikileak staff such as Sarah Harrison , Joseph farrell or kristinn hrafnsson would tell . hopefully , soon , they story too can be tell . this be not the first feature film about Julian assange Underground : the Julian assange Story , direct by Robert Connolly , and star Rachel griffith and Antony lapaglia premiere at Toronto Film Festival 2012 , twelve month before the fifth estate . the theatrical trailer be here . the world have change because of wikileak the fifth estate be careful to avoid most criticism of US foreign policy actually reveal by wikileak . the film cover 2010 , but almost none of the evidence wikileak publish that year of serious abuse within the US military and the State Department . the Afghanistan War diary expose the use of secret " kill list " and assassination squad , and dramatically shift perception of the occupation of Afghanistan and significantly reduce support for the war . the Iraq War log show direct US complicity in torture carry out by iraqi authority , enable research and advocacy by human rights group such as Amnesty International and effort to obtain justice for the victim of torture and kill . they show the true civilian death toll of the war , keep secret by the US military . cablegate have produce more news storey than any single leak in history . for year after cablegate , the world have be awash with revelation . the BBC , the New York Times and Amnesty International , and even the US government during the trial of private man , have all argue that the publication of cablegate help to trigger revolution in tunisia and across the Middle East . one cable show US troops carry out war crime with impunity , trigger the Iraq government 's decision to remove legal immunity from prosecution for US troops in Iraq , which directly lead to the US withdrawal from Iraq and therefore help end the Iraq War . the character ' anke ' be not there although the film show several hostile interaction between Julian assange and anke domscheit - berg , in fact Julian assange have never meet or speak with anke . the character ' Daniel ' be not there the fifth estate insert a " Daniel domscheit - berg " into the story for the event of 2010 , during which collateral murder , the two set of War log and cablegate be release . the real domscheit - berg be not present for any of this . the character of " Daniel " in the film be almost entirely fictitious . wikileak be found in 2006 by Julian assange . domscheit - berg start as a part-time volunteer during the year 2008 , base in Germany and help remotely from there . he work as a full - time volunteer only during the year 2009 . he last see Julian assange in Iceland in February 2010 , and be not significantly involved in wikileak after this point . all of the key release of US government document in 2010 happen after this point . domscheit - berg have no involvement in the production of the collateral murder film . he be not even in the same country as the collateral murder team . the afghan War diary be publish from London in July 2010 . domscheit - berg be in Berlin . domscheit - berg be suspend in August 2010 . he finalize he own departure from wikileak in September 2010 with the act of sabotage against wikileak server hint at ( but perversely celebrate ) in the film , make off with leak document which include evidence of more than 60 woman and child be massacre in Afghanistan by US force . he refuse to return this material to wikileak and later claim to have destroy they . within day he be promise to launch he own rival project , " openleak " , which be subsequently abandon without publishing a single document . the Iraq War log be publish in October 2010 . domscheit - berg be not there . have be suspend back in August , he be at this point court publicity for himself and speak to Tina klopp who ghostwrote the book on which the fifth estate be base . domscheit - berg have receive hundred of thousand of dollar of profit from the sale of the film rights to dreamwork . cablegate begin publication in late November 2010 and the event follow its launch go on throughout 2011 . domscheit - berg be not there . between they , Daniel domscheit - berg ( who have be formally suspend a year prior ) and the Guardian journalist David leigh ( now retire ) bring about the unredacted publication of cablegate in September 2011 , but then falsely attempt to attribute the incident to wikileak , a fiction the movie repeat . a film about wikileak without wikileak although the fifth estate purport to be about Julian assange and wikileak , the film be make without the involvement of wikileak or any of its staff , include Julian assange . however , party to dispute with wikileak be give consulting contract to work on the script . this include Daniel domscheit - berg and Nick Davies . false statement be make in the close text of the screenplay . wikileak submit via Jeff skoll of participant media suggest correction . this correction be ignore and the close text of the finish film retain the falsehood . although the film have premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival and numerous other media organization have be show review copy , the studio continue to refuse to show the film to wikileak staff . the multi-million dollar production , produce by dreamwork and distribute by Disney , have not financially contribute to wikileak or any of its defence fund . the fourth wall in the fifth estate the conclusion of the fifth estate break the dramatic '' fourth wall '' , depict the fictional Julian assange speak about the film itself from the embassy of ecuador in London . the fictional assange recite line paraphrase from the real Julian assange in public statement : julian the wikileak movie ? which one . that one ? it 's base on the worst two book . full of lie and distortion , like all bad propaganda . this attempt to make the film immune to criticism by wikileak or by assange himself . it contaminate any future act of criticism by the real Julian assange with the stigma of the fictional one . the cult narrative be completely make up Julian assange be never in a cult , but the fifth estate claim that he be . Julian assange do not dye or bleach he hair white , as claim in the film . while this interpolation may serve to enhance the dramatic narrative of the film , or to build a enigmatic or interesting central character , they have the effect of further falsely mythologize a live person as sinister and duplicitous . Julian assange have not be charge in Sweden the film falsely state that Julian assange have be charge ( with ' rape ' ) and make a number of other related false imputation . Julian assange have not be charge at any stage in any country . that he have be detain in the United Kingdom for three year without charge be one of the reason he have be grant political asylum . for more information , see http://justice4assange.com/ wikileak really be be surveille in 2009 and 2010 wikileak and Julian assange be subject to a series of surveillance event in late 2009 and during 2010 . the film portray this as fanciful but this be naïve . a few month ago it emerge that the FBI have send undercover agent to Iceland to attempt to infiltrate wikileak . a recent criminal complaint submit to german authority detail this surveillance event fully . government transparency and personal privacy go together the fifth estate present Julian assange as a transparency zealot who believe everything should be make public , but this be wrong . Julian assange believe transparency should be in proportion to power . for example , when the police be investigate the mafia , they operation should be keep secret as long as they need to be . but when they be use secrecy to cover up police brutality or other abuse , there be a need for transparency . the press should work hard to keep the identity of its source secret , and wikileak be build to do exactly this . the population have a right to privacy : the right not to be subject to mass surveillance by they government . without this , each of we be vulnerable to the abuse of power , as happen in East Germany under the stasi . work to make government more transparent and accountable be part of the same cause as safeguard the privacy of ordinary people . " I believe in the right to communicate and the inviolability of history , privacy for the weak , transparency for the powerful . " -- Julian assange wikileak protect people , not reputation wikileak implement rigorous harm - minimization procedure in order to ensure that no person would come to harm , and it be successful . nobody have ever be put in danger of harm . wikileak hold back 15,000 afghan field report for harm minimization , but the film argue that there be no harm minimization in place . wikileak adopt a policy of maximum disclosure , subject to the demand of protect human life . the Guardian and the New York Times be more concerned with appear to be '' responsible '' than with protect human life . wikileak publish the original source material for the Iraq and Afghanistan War diary and for cablegate , while the Guardian and the New York Times abuse redaction in order to distort storey in line with they institutional interest and biase . the mainstream media partner publish a tiny fraction of the State Department cable and stop publishing they in early 2011 , while wikileak go on to collaborate with over 120 media organization all over the world , bring the full set of cable into the historical record . wikileak modernize the press wikileak media collaboration in 2010 be a pioneer form of journalism . in large part , wikileak drag traditional news organization into the 21st century : by organize a powerful and effective international collaboration between hundred of media organization , by pioneer the use of large dataset in journalism , by demonstrate the importance of tough source protection to combat surveillance of journalist , by take aggressive action against censorship , and by reassert the importance of strong adversarial journalism . the innovation of Julian assange and wikileak have since form a " wikileak model " for how journalism can be do , and this have be copy by media organization all over the world . even party hostile to wikileak have acknowledge this . see New York Times ' Bill keller , " on the media " 2013 . expose wrongdo be what journalist be suppose to do US government official respond negatively to wikileak because they be embarrassed . they should be embarrassed . wikileak ' publication show that they be do something wrong . it be not the job of journalist to rescue government official from embarrassment . it be also not the job of journalist to protect government from the diplomatic or political consequence of they own wrongdo . when powerful wrongdoer fear be find out , they be force to behave more acceptably . that be a good thing . chelsea man must be support chelsea man 's case be extremely important , and everyone should campaign for she . her case be on appeal , and she have just issue a plea for a pardon from US President Barack Obama . this process be happen right now . Public opinion be crucial . a film which falsely portray the publication of 2010 in a ambivalent light , alleging non - existent harm , risk undercutte public opinion and play into the hand of the US government . emphasize that the fifth estate be fictional and there be a distinction between what it portray and reality . emphasize that chelsea man should be consider to be a classic whistleblower . quote from she recent statement urge people to support and campaign for she . chelsea man 's case be a lgbt issue it be also important to note that chelsea man 's treatment in US military detention have acquire a new human rights dimension . chelsea man have now publicly and voluntarily announce she status as a transgender individual . this be no longer ambiguous . in 2011 , she be subject to treatment which UN rapporteur Juan mendez formally find to be " cruel , inhumane and degrade '' . even former State Department spokesman pj crowley say that she treatment be '' ridiculous , counterproductive and stupid '' . this involved prolong solitary confinement , force nudity and misogynistic and homophobic verbal abuse . in the context of she declare gender identification , this treatment acquire a new dimension and should be of concern to everyone . this story be not over yet the story of wikileak do not end with the fifth estate . the film make it look like wikileak be finish in 2010 . Three year later , wikileak be still here , have be go from strength to strength , and the issue raise in 2010 be more urgent and relevant than ever . the US and UK government be in the middle of a crackdown on whistleblower and national security journalism . a confrontation between the free press and the secret state be currently play out . the scope of the crackdown on journalism have be expand to include the Guardian , the New York Times , the Washington Post , Associated Press and fox News .
