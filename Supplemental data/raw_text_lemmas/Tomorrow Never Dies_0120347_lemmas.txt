( beat ) tell I , Mr. Chin : how safe be this plant from a terrorist attack ? he hold out a microphone to Chin . chin totally secure . without code , you would need a missile to blast through the front door ; you normally can not even get this close ( to the plant ) without a full security clearance . asian male news reporter ... could you say that a little closer to the microphone ? he push the microphone closer to Chin 's face : chin of course . you would need - suddenly , a puff of white smoke emerge from the microphone ... and chin collapse . the hnn reporter take off he hat : it's yung . yung ( to the guard ) now ! at once , the two cameramen turn : one aim he shoulder - mount video camera at a surveillance camera ; the other aim at the front door . boom ! rocket shoot out from they lense , destroy both . yung let 's go ! as Yung and the cameramen rush forward - angle on the hnn boat - harmsway emerge from the boat accompany by two man carry a box of equipment . he call back to two men who have appear on deck : harmsway get the machine in the water ! they begin use a hoist to lift one of the " worm " from a hold . ( this one look like a open-mouthed torpedo , with a antenna on top , and no flexible tub attach . ) int . hallway / reception - power plant - Yung and the cameramen turn a corner to the reception / security area : power plant guard what happen out there ? yung a generator blow . nothing to worry about . ( beat ) but I need one last shot of you . why do not you stand by the alarm ? power plant guard no problem . the guard stand , and smile , pose for the video camera ... and Yung pull a pistol from he pocket and shoot he . yung ( to the cameramen ) up the stair ! they follow Yung up a set of stair lead to the reactor control room . meanwhile , back at the hnn boat : int . cabin - hnn boat bond be at the porthole , wear only short , try to figure a way out . he hear the door click open , and - a Guard enter carry a pile of bond 's clothing with he shoe on top . stamper be behind he , hold a gun on sidney . stamper put on you clothes . ( to the guard ) cuff he . the guard cuff bond 's hand ( in the front , ) and we cut back to : int . power plant control room - Yung and the cameramen sweep into the control room : lot of con - sole , with a window overlook the reactor core , and its surround blue cooling pool . yung ( to the half - dozen engineer ) I be sorry to interrupt again . but we need one more picture for the story . the engineer ad-lib reply : " sure . " " okay . " Yung smile : yung ( cont 'd ) why do not you line up against the wall ? let 's make it a group shot . the engineer line up against a wall . the cameramen take position for a massacre . and at the first sound of gunfire , we cut to : ext . entranceway - stamper be march bond and sidney through the door in handcuffs . bond sleep well ? sidney next time , I do the drive . bond give she a look . return on the control room - harmsway and Yung be lock down at the video screen of a portable version of the " worm " controller we see on the sea dolphin ii . yung the drill be in the water ; approach the intake tunnel . harmsway excellent . harmsway look up , hearing : bond I see you be in you natural element , harmsway : a room fill with lethal power ...

Yung take a shortcut - leaping on , and then over the console , as - the worm ( underwater - intake tunnel ) - chews through the last of the iron bar , and glide through the hole toward the silvery reactor core , 35 foot ahead . bond and yung - have square off in a short , brutal martial art battle . ( the fight take place in the space between the console and the reactor core window ; the gun , lie on the ground between they . ) they trade punch after punch - and although bond be hold he own , Yung be every bit he equal . back off , bond spin into a crescent kick - but Yung catch bond 's foot , and shove bond backwards , crash against a wall near a FIRE extinguisher . meanwhile , all through this ... the worm be getting closer to the core . return on bond and yung - as Yung reach down for the gun , bond grab the fire extinguisher from the wall . he rush Yung , blast he with co2 . in the white smoke , Yung drop the gun ... then charge at bond , headbutting he , twist , and turn 007 ... smashing bond backward against the glass window . the window shatter . bond be wind . and as he struggle to stop himself from fall backwards into the reactor room ... Yung do a flying , feet first kick to finish the job - but at the last second , bond duck , reach up , and use Yung 's momentum to send he fly over bond 's head into - the reactor room . he sail through the air , head for the cool pool 20 ' below , as - the worm close in on the silver reactor core . scream , yung hit the water feet first , and - underwater ( reactor core ) - the worm burrow in on he . return on the control room - bond race to hit the " emergency reactor shut down " button . he pull a FIRE alarm , disconnect the worm , and set off a " emergency decontamination " system , spraying the room with a mist of water . finally , bond retrieve the gun , and pause to look down at : the reactor pool ( bond be Pov ) - there 's a cloud of red in the middle of the blue water . return to scene - bond go to the dead guard . get the key , remove he handcuff bracelet , then hoist the dead guard over he shoulder , and exit . ext . helicopter - ( ext . aberdeen harbor power plant ) - day with the sound of fire engine approach in the background , bond strap the dead guard into the passenger seat , and take off . ext . the sea dolphin ii - ( aerial - south china sea ) - day the hnn boat have pull alongside the Sea dolphin ii . the gang from the nuke plant be board the larger boat .

S . ) it 's bond ! harmsway kill he ! finish it ! angle on stamper ( ext . mid - ship ) - with the worm dangle from a boom in the background , he watch : ext . helicopter / ship with the chopper about 15 foot above the gold hold - just barely under control - bond open the door . he leap out onto the hatch , and roll off , disappear as - the chopper crash onto the gold hold , in a giant ball of flame and twisted metal . int . storage compartment - sidney look up , hearing and feel the explosion . int . bridge - harmsway regains control of the boat ; he take a gun from the dead captain , and push the body out . ext . passageway - with flaming debris still fall around he , bond be stealthily move down a passageway toward the front of the ship . ( bond have two goal in mind at this point : first , to neutralize any threat , and second , to save sidney if she 's still alive . ) arrive at a bulkhead door , bond check both direction down the passageway , then poke he head inside - and be suddenly yanked backward , out into the passageway , throw against a railing . bond look up : stamper stand with a smile on he face . one arm be raise above he head , grasp the worm on the swinging boom . the worm be attach to the boom by a thin metal cable . stamper you be mine now . bond rush at stamper , slamm into he . the man do not flinch . with he free hand , he grab bond by he shirt , and throw he against a steel wall . bond crash to the deck . as bond recover , stamper ( still smile ) press a red button on a wall , and the worm come to life . stamper close in on bond with the worm . bond try to stand , but stamper fling he back down , pin bond against the wall with he free hand as he - maneuver the worm toward bond' head . with the cut blade whirring inch away from bond 's nose - stamper I be go to do this slowly - bond execute a scissor kick to stamper 's ankle . stamper tumble sideways . bond roll away from the worm - but by the time bond get to he foot , stamper have recover , and be rush at bond full force , with the worm . stamper thrust the worm at bond once . bond duck . the worm chew into the wall . pull the device back , stamper thrust a second time - ( same action , ) then a third ( same action ) - still miss bond . insert - close on the cable spool / cable - with all the yanking and pull , a loop of slack have develop in the cable , on the ground . return to scene - stamper be about to attack bond a fourth time when bond kick he in the groin . stamper double over in pain - and the worm fly out of he hand , swinging on the boom over the side of the ship . underwater - the grinder propel the worm forward , into the hull . sidney - ( int . storage room ) - hear a strange vibrate sound from the wall . harmsway - ( int . bridge ) - harmsway ( bark into the radio ) stamper ! report in ! ext . deck / passageway - as stamper straighten up , wind from the groin kick - harmswwy' voice ( continue , on stamper 's radio ) report to the bridge ! bond rush to a SMALL pile of slack cable , which be rapidly grow teach as the worm wend its way underwater . stamper rush bond - and in one lighten fast move , bond wrap the cable twice around stamper 's neck . suddenly the cable tightens , and - stamper soar 15 in the air , hanging by he neck , as - int . storage cabin - the worm burst through the wall ! a torrent of water flood in , push sidney off to one side . worm Pov - int . storage cabin - it 's zoom at the door ! int . passageway - the door burst open , send ton of water into the passageway . int . bridge - the boat shudder violently , send harmsway crash against a wall , cut he head . ext . the deck - as the boat rock , bond steady himself , then start for the bridge , use the same route as the cameramen lift by the chopper : first climb up on some machinery , then up onto the bridge roof . int . storage room - sidney be thrashing for air , with only a few inch leave between the rise water and the ceiling . int . passageway - 3 / 4 fill with water . rising fast . the worm Pov - ( underwater , int . passageway ) the worm be head for a door . we see the door disintegrate in front of we , as the worm burst into - the engine room . with the water cascade over the camera , ( as if we be riding inside a ocean wave , ) the worm head for a tank mark " fuel . " ext . the sea dolphin ii - the boat be sink . bond be run across the bridge roof , when : the boat suddenly list to the starboard side . int . bridge - harmsway be throw backwards . gun in hand , he make he way up the incline , to the port- side door . just when he think he 's make it - bang . bond appear in the doorway , have jump down from the roof on the small exterior walkway . he 's seethe with rage . harmsway look up at he . blink in disbelief . bond I never believe what I read in the newspaper . harmsway slowly bring up the gun . harmsway pity you will miss you obituary . bond smack the gun out of he hand with contempt . move closer . bond where be she , harmsway ? boom ! the fuel tank explode in the distance . the bridge rock violently ; the room tilt to a great angle . harmsway you want to kill I , bond ? go ahead . with both arm , bond push harmsway backwards , fling he downward against the starboard wall . the water be rise on the bridge . bond ( move in on he ) where be she harmsway ? - he grab harmsway by the lapel , and throw he against the front wall , crash onto the instrument panel head first . harmsway laugh maniacally , face down on the gauge : harmsway what be it , bond ? you have not the gut ? boom ! there 's another explosion in the background ! the front of the boat tilt upward ! the water be rush in ! bond grab harmsway by the shoulder - bond you spineless paper tiger - and yank he off the instrument panel , fling he backwards against the rear wall of the bridge . bond where be she , harmsway ?!? or do you kill she like Paris ? suddenly , the boat groans . the bridge rise out of the water ! and bond lose he balance , falling onto harmsway - harmsway ( glaring , insanely : ) we all go down together !!! harmsway lunge for bond 's throat - and the bridge slip underwater - where bond break harmsway 's grasp in a violent struggle - then punch he .

I be claim it for salvage . one -third of that gold be mine . bond and number two ? sidney if you think we be go to have some kind of ' life affirm ' romance here just because we cheat death , let I be clear : ( pause ) we be go to have it where I want , and when I want . bond and when might that be ? sidney now . he laugh . she fall into he arm . they kiss , and we cut to : two payr of binoculars - with the dinghy reflect in the glass . in unison , they be both lower , revealing q and Wade . q ... as usual , I see the situation be in 007 's very capable hand .
