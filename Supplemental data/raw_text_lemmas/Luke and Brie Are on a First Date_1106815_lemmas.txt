'' brie no . luke swear to God . and this be during the playoff , so the other guy 's like : '' repeat the three - peat ! '' so they talk about the bull for a good two minute .

I be try to run a publishing company here ! I need fifteen storey by twelve o'clock or brie 's go to lose she job ! " luke the kid respond to pressure like that ? brie yeah . it 's just another one of the volunteer in the office talk in a grumpy voice through a baby monitor . they get a kick out of it . they kind of freeze up , but then after awhile , after the editor come back on and yell at they a little bit more , they get wise . they usually spend most of the workshop try to figure out which one of we be the voice from the attic . luke and what exactly do you do ? brie they come in and I ' conduct 's they . all on the floor sit in a circle , like fourteen or eighteen kid .
