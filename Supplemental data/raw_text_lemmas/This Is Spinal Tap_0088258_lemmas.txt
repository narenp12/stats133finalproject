" Nigel : that 's , that 's nit pick , be not it ? marty : ' the Gospel accord to spinal tap ' : " this pretentious ponderous collection of religious rock psalm be enough to prompt the question : " what day do the Lord create spinal tap and could not he have rest on that day too ? " " David : never hear that one ! derek : that 's a good one , that 's a good one ! marty : the review you have on ' shark sandwich ' ... which be merely a two word review - just say " shit sandwich .

Ian : I could not agree more . all that stuff about you be too old and you be too white but .... derek : but what about the album , Ian ? David : well that 's the real problem there 's no way to promote something that do not exist , you know .... Tan : it 's a very unimportant reason , it 's just that they be experiment with , with some new uh ... package material . let I get the door . derek : what kind of experiment ? what they get monkey open it or what ? Ian : oh there 's uhh ... the other thing be that the uh ... the Boston gig have be cancel . Nigel : what ? Ian : yeah . I would not worry about it though , it 's not a big college town . Southern rock promoter : I hear you boy get a album come out . David : yeah , it should be out now , it 's call smell the Glove ... yeah ... yeah , yeah .... extra : smell the Glove ? it 's a provocative title .

Ian : no , I do not , I do not really need one . but , listen , um ... I really , I really do have to talk to you a bit about this , uh .... bobbi : Ian , come on , tell I whatever be on you mind .... Ian : .this whole issue of the , uh ... the issue of the cover . bobbi : yeah . Ian : -uh , we feel , I mean , we feel and it seem to be fact that , uh ... the company be rather down on the cover . be that the case ? bobbi : yes . Ian : you can give it to I straight , you know . bobbi : listen umm ... they do not like the cover , they do not like the cover . Ian : uh huh , well that be certainly straight . bobbi : they find it very offensive and very sexist . Ian : well what exactly ... do you find offensive , I mean , what 's offensive ? bobbi : Ian , you put a grease naked woman ... Tan : yes ... bobbi : ..on all four ... Tan : yes . bobbi : ... with a dog collar around she neck ... Ian : - with a dog collar ... bobbi : ...and a leash ... Ian : - and a leash . bobbi : ...and a man 's arm extend out up to here hold on to the leash and push a black glove in she face to sniff it . you do not find that offensive , you do not find that sexist ? Ian : no I do not , this be 1982 , bobbi , come on . bobbi : that 's right it 's 1982 get out of the 60' we do not have this mentality any more . Ian : well you shoulda see the cover they want to do . it be not a glove believe I . bobbi : I do not care what they want to do , now see this be something Ian that you be go to have to talk to you boy about . Ian : we be certainly not lay down any condition ... bobbi : and I do not think that a sexy cover be the answer for why a album sell or do not sell becuase you tell I ... the " White album " , what be that ? there be nothing on that goddamn cover . Excuse I , the phone 's ringing . Ian we will talk about this after . Ian : okay , bye bye . bobbi : hello . oh , hi Dennis . uh oh , okay . why do not you tell he ? okay , hold on one minute . Ian ? it 's eaton - hogg , he want to talk to you . Tan : bobbi : Tan : Nigel : Tan : David : bobbi : Tan : bobbi : yes ... Tan : bobbi : Nigel : David : Nigel : David : bobbi : okay . thank you darling . you be welcome ..... dear . hello Sir Dennis . hi , how be you ? ( out of phone ) oh , fuck old poofdah ! ( into phone ) but it 's really not that offensive Sir Dennis come on . okay . I will call you absolutely first thing in the morning . ( slam phone ) ah , shit . they be not gonna release the album ... because they have decide that the cover be sexist . well so what ? what 's wrong with be sexy ? I mean there 's no . sex-ist . - ist , not sexy . okay , listen I want to tell you this and and ... I be hold back because I do not know what Dennis 's decision be go to be ... but at this point both sear and k - Mart store have refuse to handle the album . they be boycot the album only because of the cover . if the first album have be a hit .... if the company be behind the album it can shove it right down they throat . money talk and bullshit walk and if the first album be a hit then we could have press on they then we could have tell they the music .... every cut on this album be a hit . let 's ... I do not give a shit what the album 's .... it 's a matter of compromise , we make a joke , and it be a long time ago , they be make it like a big deal . that 's true . you know , if we be serious and we say " yes she should be force to sniff ... smell the glove " then you would have a point you know but it 's all a joke , be not it , we be make fun of that sort of thing . it be and it be not , she should be make to smell it , but ... but not you know over and over again . you know , we can probably work something out . I will talk to Dennis and maybe we can come up with a compromise . a new design concept that we can all live with . < interview in restaurant > marty : Nigel : David : Nigel : David : Nigel : David : Nigel : David : marty : David : Nigel : David : marty : David : marty : David : marty : David : Nigel : Nigel you guy be school mate we do not ... we , we , we be not not university material what 's that on you finger ? that 's my gum ! what 's it do on you finger ?

I do not think it 's a bad idea . musically we all know it . right ? no problem musically . we go right on stage . and it 's quite simple . this be you know ... Ian can take care of this ... I know what the stonehenge monument look like . we do not have that piece of scenery anymore . I know , so we build a new one . and this be it , look ! consider ... consider it do . so you be just go to take care of it like that . you be go to find someone to design it ... use that as a plan ? let 's try . let 's try . if you can do it , I will do the number . < interview in storeroom > marty : do you feel that in collaboration with David , that you be ... afforded the opportunity to express yourself musically the way you would like to ?

I be give this napkin , I mean ... forget this ! fuck the napkin !!! --- spinal tap perform stonehenge --- room > I do not , for one , think that the problem be that the band be down . I think that the problem may have be ... that there be a stonehenge monument on the stage that be in danger of be crush by a dwarf . alright ? that tend to understate the hugeness of the object . I really think you be just make a much too big thing out of it . make a big thing out of it would have be a good idea . Nigel give I a draw that say eighteen inch . alright ? I know he do , and that 's what I be talk about . now , whether he know the difference between foot and inch be not my problem . I do what I be tell . but you be not as confuse as he be you ? I mean it 's not you job to be as confuse as Nigel be . it 's my job to do what I be ask to do by the creative element of this band . and that 's what I do . c'mon ... the audience be laugh . so it become a comedy number . yes it do ! yes it fuck well do , and it be not pleasant to be part of the comedy on stage . backstage , perhaps , it be very amusing . maybe we just fix the choreography . keep the dwarf clear . what do you mean ? so they will not trod upon it . I do not think that 's the issue . I think it 's symptomatic that maybe you be take on more than you can ...uh...uh...uh... handle . it 's not exactly the first time you have mess thing up be it ?
