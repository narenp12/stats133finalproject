" rear window " by John Michael haye base on a short story by Cornell woolrich final draft December 1 , 1953 fade in : int . jefferies ' apartment - day - long shot although we do not see the foreground window frame , we see the whole background of a greenwich Village street . we can see the rear of a number of assort house and small apartment building whose front face on the next cross-town street , sharply etched by the morning sun . some be two storey high ; other three ; some have peak roof , other be flat . there be a mixture of brick and wood and wringht iron in the construction . the apartment building have fire escape , the other do not . the neighborhood be not a prosperous one , but neither be it poor . it be a practical , conventional dwelling place for people live on marginal income , luck -- or hope and careful plan . the summer air be motionless and heavy with humid heat . it have open window wide , push back curtain , lift blind and generally bring the neighborhood life into a sweltering intimacy . yet , people bear and breed to life within earshot and eye glance of a score of neighbor have learn to preserve they own private world by uniformly ignore each other , except on direct invitation . the camera pull back until a large sleep profile of a man fill the screen . it be so large that we do not see any feature , but merely the temple and side of the cheek down which a stream of sweat be run . the camera pan off this to the right hand side of the window , and move to a thermometer which be hang on the wall just outside the window . it register 84 . the camera move on into the open , and bring nearer to we a room with a large studio window . we be able to see inside this room . a short , bald man be stand near the window , shave , use a small bowl of water and a portable mirror which he have set up on a shelf . to the right of he be a batter upright piano . on top of the piano be a radio . the music selection come from the radio stop , and the announcer be hear . announcer the time -- 7:15 a.m. , wor , New York . the temperature , outside , 84 -- Friends -- be you life worth one dollar ? the man shave quickly put down he razor , hurry to the radio , and change the station , move past a number of commercial voice until he again find some music . contented , he return to he shave . the camera move on and over to a far building . it pass over the face of this building until it come to fire escape . it go up and near enough to one which have become the outdoor bedroom of a couple . we be near enough to see a alarm clock hang from the rail which be now ringing vigorously . a man rise lazily to a sit position . he grope to switch the alarm off . we see that he pajamas be stain with sweat . in he sit position he lean forward and shake somebody beside he . to we surprise , the head of this other person -- a woman -- rise where he foot be . they have be sleep in opposite direction . they sit limply look at each other with bedraggle and weary expression which show they enjoy very little sleep in the heat of the night . the camera now move down toward the leave onto another low building . it move in a little to a live room window . just inside the windowsill , a small fan be oscillate . the fan sit on the right side of the table , and to the leave of it be a automatic toaster . behind the toaster stand a full - body young woman , apparently wear only a pair of black panty . her stomach , navel , and the lower part of she chest be naked . just below she breast , the curtain , partly draw , have throw a deep shadow which extend upward , hide she breast , shoulder and head . two piece of toast pop up in the toaster . she take they out , butter they . then she turn around and bend over another table on which stand a automatic coffee-maker . she pick up the coffee-maker , and swing back to the table to sit down . she do this so deftly that she breast be never expose , but hide by the fan as she sit down . the fan move back and forth as she pour coffee , far enough to reveal that she wear no bra , but not far enough to fulfill the exciting promise of she lack of clothes . the camera move on to a distant street corner see between two building . the traffic be very light at this hour , but a sanitation Department truck move through the intersection spraying water out behind it to cool the pavement and keep the dust down . Three little kid in bathing suit run behind the truck , play in the water . the camera move off and around to some building at the side . as it skim this building , we see a hand emerge from one of the window , and remove the cover from a birdcage which be hang from a hook on the wall outside . in the cage be two lovebird -- argue . the camera now pull back swiftly and retreat through the open window back into jeffery ' apartment . we now see more of the sleep man . the camera goe in far enough to show a head and shoulder of he . he be L.
