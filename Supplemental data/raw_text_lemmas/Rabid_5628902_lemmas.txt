I mean , they have get abortion kit . roxanne ( frustrated ) let 's just forget that anybody ever mention the idea , ok , Murray ? cypher shrug . it still sound great to he . ext . clinic driveway -- day in the middle of a landscape triangle of lawn stand a large light - box - style sign which read keloid clinic of cosmetic surgery . along one side of the triangle run a crush - gravel driveway at the end of which be a long , low garage just behind the main building , which look as though it might once have be a small stable . one of the three door of the garage slide up and a van peel rubber out of the garage , slide a bit once it hit the gravel . the van be set up inside and out exactly like a standard big-city ambulance , but without any ambulance marking . instead , sedate white lettering on the door read keloid clinic , lot . ext . field -- day read lie crumpled at the base of the tree . the end of he right collarbone be stick out at a bizarre angle and he right shoulder be hang too low . read have regain enough consciousness to feebly undo he helmet with he leave hand . Beyond he , cloud of oily black smoke curl skyward from the fall norton . read can hardly focus he eye on the figure run toward they from the camper at the edge of the field . he slip dreamily into unconsciousness . int . van -- day the clinic van turn off a secondary road on to the two -lane highway and accelerate furiously , toss its occupant around as it momentarily slew sideways . in the back of the van be Steve , who be busily prepare stretcher and oxygen , and Dr. keloid . keloid prepare several hypodermic syringe while expertly brace himself against the motion of the van .

I could not get near it . keloid kneel beside Rose . he take a pair of scissors from he bag and cut the helmet strap under she chin . he slip the helmet off she head with great care . her long blonde hair fall into a pool around she face , which seem remarkably at peace and untouched : only a rectangle of black soot where she helmet 's visor melt away and admit smoke give any indication of what she 's go through . when the orderly arrive , the man point out read for they . man there 's another one over there . I see he movin ' around a minute ago . keloid ( to orderly ) might as well go get he . we will not be ready to move she for a few minute . the orderly trot off toward read with they stretcher . the man watch they leave , then turn back to look at Rose . he shake he head as keloid give she a injection . man Christ .

I know , but let I tell you what we be look at . the gas tank explode over the girl 's abdomen and I do not know what she 's get leave in there . the man 's get a break hand , separate shoulder , concussion , the usual . we can send he to the General . but it 's definitely major surgery for she , and right now . I know we be not , but we have get no choice . I would say she 's get a half hour to live and it 's three hour to the nearest serious hospital . it 's we or nobody . yeah . I hope I can remember too . well , they say it 's like riding a bicycle . ext . clinic driveway -- day the van stop in front of the clinic and the orderly jump out . keloid hold the bottle and the oxygen as the orderly unload the stretcher and roll it up the front walk of the clinic , which be a spectacularly renovate old farmhouse -- all sandblasted auburn brick , pine , and cedar planking , white paint and vista vision window . a group compose of patient and staff cluster around the main door of the clinic to watch as the stretcher approach . nobody seem to notice read , who have be leave sit in the van . int . clinic entrance -- day Lloyd walsh hold open one of the main glass door while a nurse open the other one . the secretary -- receptionist abandon she phone and she sleek plastic desk / filing cabinet module to work she way through the group at the door in order to take a look . walsh make room for the secretary -- Sheila -- beside he . Rose be wheeled through the door . her condition be so obviously serious and so different from the usual ' touch - up ' job do at the keloid Clinic , which have a carefully calculate country resort atmosphere about it , that everyone become completely silent as she enter . keloid ( to nurse at door ) get the guy in the van into observation and check he out . but take it easy -- concussion , separate shoulder , break hand . ok , Louise ? maybe some demerol when he become lucid . louise ok , Dr. keloid . Louise leave the door once the stretcher have go by and head out to the van . walsh let go of he door and jog after she . Jackie , still wear sunglass , shake she head as she watch the stretcher go off down the hall and turn to the middle - age lady stand next to she . jackie what a waste . she do not even need a nose job . int . clinic hallway -- day the orderly wheel the stretcher down a hallway which be patently never mean to be use as a hospital corridor : Rose be get a very rough ride . as they move along they pass various patient who react with shock and horror when they see Rose . the keloid Clinic be usually more discreet about blood than a normal hospital . man ( as Rose pass ) Jesus wept ! what 's that all about ? woman somebody say something about a accident . man ( repulse ) could not they throw a sheet over it or something ? I be start to feel like I be in a hospital . the fastidious man and he companion go through some door which , accord to a elegantly lettere sign on a wall lead to a squash court . the orderly stop in front of another set of door . keloid hand one of they the bottle he have be hold as a second nurse , rita , come out to meet they . rita be a very solid , square - body , fortyish lady . keloid ok , boy . take she into pre -op and tell Dr. Karl to set she up for the work . int . surgical wash - up -- day keloid and roxanne wash with disinfectant in preparation for Rose 's operation , aid by a third orderly whom we have not see before . roxanne be short , dark , intense , and ambitious beyond she present practice . she do not wear she thirty - seven year particularly well , so the age difference between she and she husband seem more theoretical than anything else . she be very particular about be call by she maiden name and be know as Dr. rushton to all the clinic 's patient . at the moment , keloid and roxanne be have a very control , low - key argument which roxanne try to keep the orderly from hearing . roxanne I do not buy it , Dan . keloid you have not see she . roxanne I do not have to see she . neutral field graft have never be use internally . we could end up with a terminal cancer patient on we hand . keloid aw , c'mon . we can monitor , roxy . she 's get nothing to lose . literally . she do not have enough small intestine leave to absorb nutrient . if we just close she up she will have to be feed intravenously for the rest of she life , which will be a short and a dismal one . but if we graft neutral field tissue cone into the abdominal cavity , there 's a chance that they will read she condition by post - embryonic induction and develop into a new set of intestine . roxanne or run wild and make some very creative malignant tumor . Dan , the clinic do not need this . let 's play it safe . keloid do not respond . he finish snap on he surgical glove and turn to the scrub-nurse , who help he on with he sterilize operate tunic . int . observation room -- day read have regain full consciousness in the clinic 's observation room and be watch Louise cut away he well - wear leather motorcycle jacket with a pair of snub- nose surgical scissors . she cut she way up the right sleeve to the shoulder , then across the shoulder to the collar . she be then able to slip the jacket easily away from read 's right shoulder , which be still very obviously not where it should be . she now start in on he norton T-shirt , which be all he be wear underneath he jacket . read oh , no . not the T-shirt . Rose give I the T-shirt . louise I think you would find it pretty painful try to take if off the standard way . read make a attempt to slip he arm out of he T-shirt but immediately give up , grimace in pain . read no , look . I think I can ... ow ! oh ! you be right . cut the thing off . I will put it up on the wall of my garage . Louise continue snipping off the T-shirt . read so when do I get to see Rose ? louise not for a while . read why not ? Louise do not answer . read pull away from Louise and try to stand up . he can not keep he balance and fall back against the wall , bang he wreck shoulder . read I want to see she right now ! ow ! oh , God . I do not kill she , do I ? Louise reach for a syringe of demerol . louise she 's not dead . read what be that stuff ? I do not want you to put I out . louise it 's just demerol . it will ease the pain . all right ? read let Louise take he good arm . she swab he down and sink the needle in . read ( sarcastically ) sure. wonderful . anything to ease the pain . int . operating room -- day keloid and roxanne be well into they operation on Rose , assist by a team of five which include Dr. William Karl , the clinic 's anesthetist . keloid and roxanne be in the process of cut large square of skin from Rose 's thigh . keloid now , I know everyone here be familiar with the standard technique of skin graft , but what we be go to do be a little out of the ordinary . I will explain it as we go . we be remove full - thickness skin graft material from the patient 's thigh as per normal graft acquisition procedure . however , before this graft be apply to the damage area of the patient 's breast , abdomen , and so on , they will be treat so that they become morphogenetically neutral . they be then call neutral field graft . karl can we treat the graft material here , Dr. keloid ? keloid no , Dr. Karl . the graft tissue will be freeze and send to the sperl Institute . we will have to keep the patient in a operation - ready state until it come back to we . that 's go to be a bit try for all of we , but it can not be help . as keloid speak , the section of thigh skin be place in spun aluminum cylinder of the same general type as that use in eye bank . the cylinder be then seal and place in a medical freezer . rita I do not understand the functional difference between neutral field and normal graft tissue , Doctor . keloid well , when the thigh skin tissue be treat , nurse benedetto , it will lose its specificity as both thigh tissue and skin tissue . for example , if it be graft to a burn cheek , it would not just be thigh skin with the color and texture of thigh skin -- it would actually develop as facial tissue . in other word , neutral field tissue have the same ability to form any part of the human body that the tissue of a human embryo have . karl Doctor , this patient have lose most of she absorptive intestinal mucosa . could neutral field tissue reconstruct a organ as complex as the small intestine . keloid yes , Dr. Karl . I think that under the right circumstance it could . I have do it myself use lab animal at the sperl Institute . keloid and roxanne exchange glance , then keloid look away . keloid let I add that there be always a possibility that carcinomas will form when neutral field graft be use internally . in this case , we be use a radical plastic -surgery technique to compensate for we lack of heavy medical hardware . we be do it to save a life . it 's the only trick we have get . ext . keloid clinic -- day Wide shot of exterior front of the keloid Clinic in late autumn . slow dissolve to : ext . keloid clinic -- one month later -- day same shot as previous scene , one month later . snow be on the ground and the tree be bare . slow dissolve to : int . rose's room at the keloid clinic -- day read stand over Rose 's bed , which be a very well - disguise hospital bed ( everything possible be do to keep the clinic from feel like a hospital ) . read 's leave hand be encase in a wire cage which support all he finger . he be watch Rose intently , who be still in a coma and be attach to a battery of intravenous bottle connect to she by clear vinyl tube and iv needle . read be particularly fascinate by Rose 's eye , which he can see move around wildly behind she eyelid . he bend close , then kiss she gently on she pale , dry lip . int . clinic hallway -- day nurse Louise walk briskly down a hall toward Rose 's room . on she way she pass Judy glasberg clutching a pocket edition of the life and work of sigmund Freud and strolling thoughtfully in the opposite direction . louise hi , Judy glasberg . you back again ? judy daddy do not think the new nose be different enough , so I be in for more alteration . I keep tell he it look just like he , and he keep say , ' that 's why I want you to change it . ' I be terrify to find out what it all mean . they both laugh . the two woman part and go they separate way . we follow Louise as she open the door to Rose 's room , which bear a print sign say : intensive care , qualified personnel only . int . rose's room -- day Louise enter the room in time to surprise read in the act of pull back the sheet cover Rose . louise do not you see the sign on the door , Mr read ? you be suppose to register with I before you come in here . read I see it . I guess I consider myself qualified . Louise edge read away from the bed and cover Rose up again . her entire body be heavily bandage , and almost every inch of expose skin have a iv needle tape to it . Louise begin to moisten Rose 's eyelid and lip with various gel . louise what be you try to do , give she pneumonia ? read I be try to ease my guilt feeling by tell myself that Rose be get better . louise ( soften ) I see . be it work ? read be she get better ? louise you have be here often enough in the past two month to know as much as I do . read when do I get to see Dr. keloid ? louise you never tell I in advance when you be come . how can I make a appointment for you ? read I never know in advance when the next wave of guilt will hit I . I want to see he right now . louise he 's in a meeting . read tell he I force you . louise ( leave the room ) all right . but please ... no touch until she 's conscious . read ok , Mom . Louise make a face and leave . int . keloid be office -- day read sit across from keloid 's desk in keloid 's office , which seem more like a successful pr executive 's office than a doctor 's . while they talk , keloid toy with Rose 's file , not really ever look at it : he be obviously very familiar with its content , and also in a very distract frame of mind . keloid well , as you have see , Rose be still in some kind of coma , sort of half real coma , half normal deep sleep . could be week before she 's lucid . read you do not know for sure ? keloid no . her body be still in a state of total shock . she can not possibly be move to a city hospital yet . her graft seem to be heal well . we have be monitoring the internal graft electronically and there be definitely new tissue growth happen in the abdominal cavity . whether this growth will mature into function intestinal mucosa we will not know for quite a while . read you mean if you graft or whatever they be do not work , she will never eat like a normal human be again . she will have to be feed intravenously . keloid that 's right . at the moment , she have only enough small intestine to digest the most basic nutrient material . see -- the longer the small intestine , the more complex the food that can be break down and absorb by the body as food . cow have lot and lot of intestine so they can eat grass and other vegetable matter . we have medium - length intestine , so we can eat meat and a limited variety of vegetable matter . vampire bat -- the real one , I mean -- have short intestine , so they eat whole blood , which be very easy to break down and assimilate . you girlfriend 's in the same boat . read what about she brain ? keloid her helmet probably save she from brain damage , but until she 's fully conscious ... read you will not know that either . keloid ( throw up he hand ) hart , what can I tell you ? there 's no magic . look , I have do my best . you be welcome to come here and keep you vigil by Rose 's bedside any time the mood take you , but please believe I , I will personally telephone you the instant Rose show even the slight sign of regain consciousness . read sigh , then shrug with he good shoulder . ext . clinic driveway -- day Lloyd walsh and read stand in the driveway watch as two orderly load the burn and smashed hulk of read 's norton into the back of Murray cypher 's Ford station wagon . walsh jeez , when I see that thing burn , I never figure I would be stand here talk to you a month later . how 's you hand ? read they be take the cage off this afternoon . that 's when I will find out . the pin stay in my shoulder for another month , though . do not seem to bother I except when it get damp . cypher come hurriedly out of the front door , put on a suit jacket and stuff papers into he attach Â® case at the same time . he walk over to read and walsh and open the door of he car . cypher ( to walsh ) hi , Lloyd . how ya doin ' ? walsh great . cypher get into he car , slam the door , and pop the passenger door open for read . cypher c'mon , hart . I get a pack of hungry investor wait for I . read get into the station wagon as the orderly slam the rear door shut on the norton . walsh wave goodbye to read , who smile weakly . cypher I hope you have get some friend who will help you unload that pile of junk . I have get a bad back . what be you go to do with it ? use it for a ashtray ? he turn the ignition key and start the station wagon . read give it to a friend for part . I can hardly stand to look at it . think I will get back into go -kart . cypher laugh , wave to walsh , and pull away from the driveway . walsh smile at they and turn back to the clinic , patting himself absently under the chin as he go . ext . clinic -- day Wide -angle shot of the front of the clinic as walsh go back inside . slow dissolve to : ext . clinic -- night same shot as previous scene , but late at night . there be only one or two light on inside . int . clinic hall / night nurse's station -- night the night nurse check she watch at she station , which be little more than a desk , chair , and lamp place at the end of a hall . it 's time for she to make she round . she put down she magazine -- people -- and walk down the hall . at the end of it , she disappear down a stairwell . int . another hall -- night the night nurse walk past Rose 's room , pause only for a moment to glance in at Rose 's sleep form . she then continue on down the hall . int . another hall -- night the night nurse walk past Lloyd walsh 's door . there be a please do not disturb sign hang from he doorknob . the nurse notice that walsh 's light be on and diffuse out through the crack under the door , but she continue on down the hall . int . walsh' room -- night walsh be lie in bed read the life and work of sigmund Freud , which he have borrow from Judy glasberg . his room , like all the private room at the clinic , be furnish in the style of the plushest , most modern jet - set ski lodge . it 's easy to understand why patient extend they stay beyond what be medically necessary , and just as obvious that the keloid Clinic management make no attempt to discourage this " home away from home ' attitude toward the place . walsh can not get comfortable with the book , which he have just start to read . he check he watch . it 's 1.13 a.m . he 's a little nervous about he operation tomorrow morning . he put down he book , get out of bed , put on he bathrobe , slip into he slipper , and leave he room to go for a stroll through the desert clinic . int . clinic hallway -- night hand in pocket , walsh stroll through the clinic , past the lounge , the ping - pong table , the breakfast nook . int . another hallway -- night walsh round a corner that lead he past Rose 's door , which still bear its intensive care sign . as he pass by she door , he hear a muffle scream follow by a series of moan and indistinct , angry shout . walsh open she door without hesitation . int . rose's room -- night by the light of the full moon and the hallway , walsh can see Rose thrashing around violently in she bed , get twisted up in she sheet and rip out she iv needle . as he watch , one of she iv bottle , pull off its stand by its feed tube , fall to the floor and smashes to piece , spilling blood plasma everywhere . walsh now see that the floor be litter with shred bit and piece of surgical gauze and bandage , which Rose have tear from she various wound and graft . the plasma begin to soak into the debris surround the bed . her torso be still cover only by bandage , make she look like a mummy jerk to life in the half - light of she tomb . walsh rush over to the bed and quickly lower the safety railing . he then try to hold Rose down by the shoulder to keep she from pull out the last of she iv tube . when he grab she by the wrist , he notice that she be ooze blood from where the iv needle have be pull out . walsh rosie , rosie , sweetie , take it easy ! you need that juice , sweetie . it 's keep you alive . hey , easy , there . easy . that 's it . that 's a girl . under the pressure of walsh 's body , Rose begin to calm down . her eye , which have be open but stare and unsee , now begin to fill with consciousness . rose hart ? what be you ... what be you do , hart ? be we all right ? be we ... walsh I be not hart , rosie . hart 's back in montreal wait for you .

Mr. walsh , he may well be ... keloid ( turn to rita ) rita , Lloyd walsh would not do something like that . he just would not . and none of this explain how he get he wound .

Judy 's body be wrack by one final spasm , then she relax completely , she head go under completely . the last bubbles of air from she lung mix with the bubbles spew out by the whirlpool oxygenator . after a few moment , Rose release Judy . we see a close - up of the translucent fleshy tube , now empty of blood , slide back into its sheath . it be only after she have back away and take several soul - deep breath that Rose notice Judy 's face be two inch below the surface of the water , the tip of she nose almost break through to the air but not quite .
