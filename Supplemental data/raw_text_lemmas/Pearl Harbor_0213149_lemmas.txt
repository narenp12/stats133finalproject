pearl harbor by randall wallace early draft out of black we hear the sound of a airplane roaring by . ext . Pov of a airplane Flying over american heartland . we see the earth through the pilot 's perspective as sky and ground swap position , the plane swoop down and storming over the ground . the plane be a biplane , racing over a field lush with young plant . it release a trail of crop spray , and climb again ... up into a crystalline blue sky where sunshine pour like honey over family farm stretch to the horizon . maybe it 's not heaven , maybe it 's just Tennessee . but as long as there 's be a America , man have fight and die for this place -- as volunteer . Far off , but visible from the plane be a barn - day the barn be unpaint except for hand lettering that say " mccawley crop dusting . " another plane noise , this one make by kid , bring we to two boy , sit in the shell of a old plane propped on crate , scavenge of it 's engine , seat , and wheel . the boy sit in it 's cockpit , butt crowded onto the nail keg they have replace the seat with . they have even attach a 2 x4 as propeller , as if they imagination need any help . they wear overall and have bowl haircut : rafe and danny , 10 year old . rafe bandit at 2 o'clock . danny power dive ! they buzz they lip in a fly noise and work the control , rafe 's bare foot on one pedal , Danny 's on the other . rafe it 's Germans ! danny kill the bastard ! rafe look at Danny in shock -- then they both laugh and go right back into they game , manufacturing they own machine gun and engine sound . rafe good shoot , Danny ! danny good shoot , rafe ! rafe land of the free ... danny Home of the brave ! rafe there 's another one ! they vocal motor roar again ... but a man 's hand grab Danny by the strap of he overall and jerk he from the cockpit . it 's Danny 's father and he 's a fearsome sight ; drunk , he hair uncomb , he face unshaven , he tooth -- that still leave -- be rotting . he 's also miss a arm ; but the one that 's leave be potent , and he 's shaking Danny with it . danny's father you no count boy ! Johnson come lookin' , say he would pay a dime for you to shovel he pig shed , and I can not find you no place . danny daddy , I tell you I be comin ' here . his father slap he off he foot . rafe be so horrify he can not get a sound out . Danny be not even surprised . but when he father snatch he up again , twist the overall strap so tight they choke he , he struggle . it do no good ; he father start march across the field , drag and strangling Danny . danny Da !... dad ... the father 's drunken anger make he oblivious -- until crack ! the 2 x4 propeller slam he across the back , knock he to the ground and make he drop Danny . the father roll over to see 10 - year - old rafe , hold the 2 x4 like a bat . rafe let he alone ! the father 's eye bulge in rage ; he struggle to he foot . danny rafe ... daddy ... no ! the man look murderous , but rafe draw back the board . rafe I will bust you open , you ... german ! the word ring something deep in the man 's booze - break brain . he begin to cough , convulsively ; it bring a blossom of blood to he mouth . he wipe it with he hand , but blood cling to he tooth . he choke out -- danny's father I fight the Germans . he look at Danny in shame , with the realization of what he 's just do . he turn and stagger away . Danny look at rafe -- a communication between boy join by something deeper than blood . then Danny run off after he father . danny daddy ! daddy ! wait . Danny catch he , take he father 's hand , and walk away with he . the crop duster we see in the air have just land , behind rafe . the pilot , rafe' father , shut off the engine . rafe' father what 's goin ' on , son ? rafe nothing . Danny 's dad just come to get he . rafe turn back to the ramshackle plane and replace the 2 x4 propeller . his father look toward Danny and he father , walk away , then look at he own son . rafe' father hey , boy -- you wanna go up ? rafe can not believe it ; he run to the plane and hop into he father 's lap . as he father crank the engine and tuck he into the harness , rafe say -- rafe daddy , sometime will you take Danny up too ? rafe' father sure will , son . the engine race to life ... and we -- dissolve to : ext . new jersey AIR base - day american p - 40 fighter blast through the air , prop scream and wind sing by they wing . there be eight pilot in they individual seat , and we focus on two : rafe mccawley have grow lean and handsome . and danny WALKER be very much the same . they plane start swapping position in the formation ; while the other guy be fly along in a tight line , rafe and Danny be play , one of they gun he engine to go high , the other diving and come back up in he place , leapfrogge . it scare the other guy , have they plane flash in and out , so close . the training captain , watch through binocular on the ground , talk into he radio -- training captain mccawley !
