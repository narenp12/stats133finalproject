Alexander nurse a blue beverage . Tommy examine a high tech metallic cast on he arm . the computer list off a endless damage report . computer ..- forward thruster shaft , 87 % damage ... Left vector guard , 96 % damage ... level 5 structural breach in quadrant 32 , 34 , 40 , 43 , 58 ... jason and the engine ? gwen Computer , what about we engine ? why do not we have power ? computer the carbonite sphere have fracture under stress . damage to carbonite sphere irreparable . New source of carbonite must secure . tommy oh great . there 's no spare on the ship ? guy fe do not have one on the show , so they do not ere . tommy --- Hell , even my yugo come with a spare . 56 . alexander ( to Jason ) you break the ship ! you break the bloody ship ! I tell you you do not hold down a turbo . you push it once , maybe twice for a boost but you bon 's t hold it . suddenly the door open and seven alien enter , lead by betzalar . they look very serious . guy exchange a '' uh oh '' glance with Tommy ... but the alien fall to one knee , lowering they head . betzalar a thousand apology . we have fail you . the actor exchange surprised glance . jason you what ?.. what be you talk about ? betzalar we have see you victorious in much more desperate situation . the fault must lie with we , with the ship , with we engineering ... jason no , no ... it be we , betzalar . listen ... we be ... we be ... we be not the people you think we be . betzalar I do not understand ... gwen betzalar , do not you have television on you planet ? movie ?

Jason open he mouth , but be not sure what to say ... suddenly a viewscreen light and we see dusty on the monitor from down in the generator room . dusty ( on screen} hey Captain . listen , we detector have pick - up a source of carbonite on a nearby planet . what do you think about the idea of rigging the aft solar distributor in a parallel matrix and configure for negative propulsion ? it will not be a rocket ride , but it should get we there . jason ( impressed ) I ... well , uh ... yes , absolutely ! dusty turn to two young tech next to he . dusty correct ! gold star for you and a gold star for you ... he lick and stick two sticky gold star on the wrist of two beam alien tech . 58 . ext . ship the ship lumber slowly forward . in the distance we see the swirl globe of a colorful and mysterious planet . int . surface pod BAY - later Jason , gwen , Tommy and guy enter the small surface pod . quellek , Alexander 's protege , step forward , hand Alex a device . quellek Dr. lazarus , here be you surface mapper . I have programe it to the coordinate of a carbonite sphere of sufficient density . alexander thanks . quellek ( emotional ) good luck on you mission , sir. by grabthar 's Hammer , by the sun of warvan I wish you - alexander ( hold up a warning finger ) uh uh ! what do we talk about ? quellek right ... sorry , sir . int . surface pod Tommy pilot the craft . out the window the pod approach the planet . it 's a amazing sight , a blue sky with red cloud . Three sun hang in the horizon . guy look out the window nervously . guy I change my mind . I want to go back . alexander after the big fuss you make about not get leave behind on the ship ? guy yeah , but that 's when I think maybe I be the crewmember that stay on the ship and something be up there and it kill I , but now I be think I be the guy who get kill by some monster five minute after we land on the planet . it make perfect sense ... jason guy , you be not go to get kill on the planet , okay ? guy oh , I be not ? I be not ? then what 's my last name ? 53 . jason you last name ? guy yeah , what be it ? jason it 's ... I do not know . guy no. nobody do . do you know why ? because my character be not important enough for a last name . because I be go to die five minute in , why bother to come up with a last name for I ? gwen guy , you have a last name . we just do not know to guy De i? doi ? for all you know I be just '' crewman 6 " ! ( hysterical ) okay , it 's fleegman ! guy fleegman ! there ! now I be a whole person ! I can not die ! fleegman ! they can â€™t kill I now , can they ? can they ? Jason slap he . guy see ? I be the hysterical guy who need to be slap , and then I die ! alexander ( look around with a sigh ) be we there yet ? ext . surface pod the pod make its way toward the surface , and land softly . int . pod everyone applaud , compliment Tommy on the landing . Tommy look away , shame . tommy autopilot . everyone look away , disappointed . ext . planet surface - day hard rain beat down on the pod . the five exit the craft and look around . Alexander check he mapper . 60 . alexander it 's this way ... ( they start forward ) wait ... no ... that way . they all turn and head the opposite direction . guy you have it upside - down , do not you ? alexander shut up . tommy you know , with the makeup and everything , I actually believe he know he ass from a gopher hole for a second ... gwen I too ! we pull back to see the landscape around they . it 's a marvel , huge crystal formation and gleam mountain surround they . ext . crystal planet - valley - later the rain pour mercilessly as they move through a valley . lightn flash on the horizon . they continue forward . ext . crystal planet - incline - later they move up a moderate grade as the rain abate . Soft earth squish under they boot . guy lock down to see tiny bud beginning to peek up through the dirt , grow like time lapse photography . he bend over and reach out to touch one bud as it open its petal revealing ... row tiny little teeth . and suddenly it thrust forward and chomp down on guy 's finger . guy yelp , try to withdraw he finger , but it 's get a good grip . guy see ?! I told you ! five minute ! Alexander crush the plant underfoot , shaking he head . guy suck on he bleed finger as they continue on . ext . planet - valley pass they continue up a grade , and cloud pass over the sun in the sky , darken the horizon . gwen more rain ? tommy more something ... indeed the cloud look peculiar ... like icy crystalline structure float in the sky . suddenly there be a crash of thunder and it begin to rain solid freeze projectile ... 61 . hundred of stalactite fall like knife from the sky . Jason tackle Tommy , push he aside just as one of the projectile impact . it would have cut he in half . jason take cover ! there ! they all run toward a cliff face dot with cave and overhang .... everyone scatter to the cave close to they . int . crystalline cave Jason and gwen enter from outside ... the room glow with shiny green and pink crystal ... jason I guess we will have to wait it out . they sit and watch the freeze rain fall and melt into pool outside for a long moment ... then simultaneously they get the same think . they turn to each other ... jason and gwen episode 23 . '' the cavern of delo 5 . '' jason '' it 's not we , tawny ... it 's this cave , they have some strange power over we ... " gwen '' oh , Captain , I could never reveal my true feeling until now ... '' jason * resist it , tawny ... resist it ! it 's just the cave talk ! be strong ! '' she move over to he melodramatically . gwen '' kiss I Captain ? oh , please , kiss I ... '' they laugh at the dumb dialogue . there 's a awkward pause as Jason think about really kissing gwen . but she move away before it become a issue . jason we always have fun , do not we ? gwen well they do . I be not so sure about we ... jason oh , come on . we have good time . remember when we mic have Alex in he trailer ? remember the space monkey in Tommy 's locker ? ( a beat ) remember up in the catwalk between lighting setup ?... 62 . gwen sure , on the set we be great . but off the set ... jason we have plenty of good time off the set ... there be the time I ... there be that time we ... remember at the beach house we ... gwen fought . jason yeah . we fight a lot . ( think ) it be I . it be my fault . gwen nsurprise at the admission ) yeah ? you never say that . jason it 's strange , you know ..? the way people treat you like you character . even the grip and teamster who should know better ... gwen ( motion to she outfit ) tell I about it . jason I know . you could not wait to get out of there at wrap ... but I , I would have sleep in stage six if they have let I . it be the best time of my life . the way people look at I ... like I could do anything ... I could even get someone as amazing as you to think I be special . gwen you think it be he I want ?... jason truthfully ... be not it ? just a little ? gwen maybe ... what girl do not want to be with Captain taggart ? ( a beat ) but Captain taggart could not make I laugh . they exchange a long glance . jason that sound like the cave talk . she laugh , prove she own point as they look out the cave entrance ... a long beat as they watch the rain ... 63 . jason I still think we have fun off the set once ... gwen well let I know if you think of it ... dissolve to : ext . planet the rain have stop ... the five actor have regroupe , and be trudging up a steep grade as the three sun in the sky boil away the water on the ground . carbonite quarry - dusk they move to a cul - de-sac of large dusty boulder , exhaust and parched . Alexander 's device beeps as he approach one five foot in diameter . alexander this be it . tommy I think it be go to be little . guy you never watch the show at all , do you ? suddenly they hear a sound from the darkness , a strange sound , half human , half animal . guy that 's it . that 's what 's go to kill I . alexander will you shut up . gwen let 's get out of here before something kill guy . they surround the boulder and start to push it the way they come . crystalline pass they push the carbonite sphere forward as around they they hear more spooky voice whisper in a alien tongue . and the sound of rock shifting ; critter climb around the surround cliff . gwen I see something move . jason I too . let 's just keep go . they push the carbonite past a cliff revealing a pool of glimmer liquid . at the pool be two SMALL blue being that look somewhat like human child , drink . everyone stare . 64 . guy c'mon , let 's go ... gwen look at they . they be cute . they look like child ... she wave at one of they . it cock its head and wave back . guy of course they be cufe now . but in a second they be go get ugly and mean somehow and then when we turn around there 's go to be a million more of they ... gwen and Tommy make baby talk sound to they . they make baby talk sound back .. guy Jesus , do not any of you guy watch the show ?! gwen smile . the alien smile back , imitate she ... but it 's a hideous sight : they lip curl three time wider across they face than normal and they mouth reveal huge sharp tooth . we then notice that one of they be hold a ragged severe leg , and have blood in he tooth . the actor hear more skittering behind they and turn slowly to see dozen of alien demon child appear on the ridge . guy I be so sick of be right ! the demon child begin come down the hillside in wave . alexander God I hope they be just come for guy . jason câ€™mon . push ! they push the carbonite rock to the ridge as fast as they can . it 's all downhill from there , luckily ... the bad news be ... ..- below they see the field of carnivorous flowers now grow to eight foot tall , and there be hundred of they , all snap and bite at each other . -.- jagon turn to see the stampede of the demonic alien come at they like a tidal wave . he make a decision . jason stay close behind it . he give the carbonite boulder a shove and it begin roll down the hill , faster and faster . the actor follow in its path ... down the hill ... straight into the flower field ... the now muscular plant SNAP at they with powerful jaw , but the boulder mow down the one in they path and they make it through ... 65 . up ahead the surface pod be in sight . Jason look back to see the demon alien follow through the field , some get carry into the air and eat by the plant , but by sheer number , most get through and still in pursuit . the group follow the boulder as it come to rest at the pod . they roll the boulder onto the ramp as the demon alien grow closer . but the boulder now block the entrance . gwen help guy inside , then squeeze through herself , follow by Tommy . Alexander and Jason both motion each other forward . alexander go ahead ! jason you go first ! there 's no time ! alexander oh , of course , I forget ! you have to be the hero ... Heaven forbid I get the spotlight once ! oh no , Jason nesmith could not possibly - Jason cold cock he unconscious and lift he through , then squeeze through himself as behind he the demon alien descend upon the pod int . pod Jason be almost through . jason Tommy , I be in , push go now ! Tommy push the button when suddenly Jason be grabbed by the ankle by five payr of demon hand and drag back outside just as the door close behind he . gwen oh my ged ! Tommy ! stop the pod ! stop the pod ! tommy I can not ... it 's on autopilot !... as they pod ascend they all move to the window to watch horrify as Jason disappear into the middle of the huge blue mob that surround he . Alexander regains consciousness , look around . alexander re knock I out the sonofabitch . where be he ? gwen ( horrify ) down there . Alexander join the other , look down at the blue mob below . 66 . alexander oh right , of course ... it 's always about you , be not it ?! the view fade to white as we move up into cloud . ext . planet surface - dawn one of the sun rise on the horizon . int . alien slaughterhouse Jason be tie to a slab , he shirt off . around the room be hook from which hang various severe part of a variety of strange alien body . he be surround by five of the demon . one of they bring forth a long carve knife . jason wait . just wait . you speak English ?... habla espanol ? parle - without hesitation , the alien slice a thin slice of '' meat '' from Jason 's shoulder , and eat it from a fork . jason agh ! jesus ! what the hell be you do ? the demon confer in a strange subtitled language . demon # 1 it be suitable . demon # 2 I will try . he slice off another bit of meat and chew . Jason yell . jason . owwww ! stop ! no more ! not one more bite , do you understand ? do not eat one more bite of - aaaagh ! shit ! suddenly we hear a rumbling from outside , like a volcano , and another alien run in . demon # 3 the hill of fire . demon # 1 gorignak be displease . demon # 2 it have be too long since a offer . they look down at Jason . he look back , wary . demon # 1 yes. unfortunate . it be flavorful . 67 . demon 2 what do you suppose it be ? demon # 1 {momentarily introspective ) I do not know . strange , it look like a child . demon # 3 what should I do ? demon # 1 hit it with a rock , demon three lift a rock and Jason do not have time to object before everything go black . int . ship pod BAY the pod door open and gwen , Alexander and the other exit , out of breath . they be greet by dusty and three of he generator room tech . gwen we get the carbonite , but the Captain 's down there with a bunch of cannibal ! dusty we have to go back down in the pod then ... gwen there 's no time . what about that dohicky ... that transport we back and forth ? it 's you thing , dusty , you know ... '' molecularize I in , sergeant chen ... " do we have one of that ? dusty the molecular conveyor ... tommy of course , we could just zap he up with the molecular conveyor ! teb ?... teb yes , we do build a conveyor , of course ... gwen what be we wait for ? you guy get the carbonite sphere up and run , okay ? teb , take we to the conveyor station . they exit run . dusty look a little unsure ... int . corridor gwen , Alexander , dusty , Tommy , guy and the technician teb run down the hallway . buff , Alexander turn to gwen . alexander you say '' the Captain .

Jason hear scratch footstep approach around a corner . he rise quickly and grab he spear . the animal appear .. it look about the size of a pot belly pig , but somewhat reptilian . demon gorignak ... gorignak ...

Jason pull the vox from he belt . jason yes . yes , I be here ! int . ship - molecular conveyer room gwen , Alexander and the other watch Jason on a viewscreen . gwen thank God . be you okay ? jason yeah .. they want I to fight this thing , gorignak ... I think I can take it though ... 69 , gwen Jason , we be go to use the molecular conveyer to get you out of there . Jason poke at the pig-lizard . it hiss at he petulantly . jason the molecular conveyer ? wait , that 's the thing that pull I apart into a zillion piece zap I up there , and reassemble I , right ? dusty right . jason I 'il take my chance with gorignak . the pig lizard nip at Jason , get a bite . Jason stab back . gwen Jason , we have get to get you out of there ... it 's perfectly safe , be not it , teb ? teb it have never be successfully test . jason what ? what do he say ? gwen nothing . hold please . she switch off the vox , they turn to teb . teb theoretically the mechanism be fully operational . however , it be build to accommodate you anatomy , not ours . we actual hand be six finger and jointed at ninety degree to yours . we be unable to operate the device with the require dexterity . but now that sergeant chen be here he can operate it ... it be design watch he motion from the historical record . everyone turn to dusty . for the first time , he look a little apprehensive . he laugh nervously . dusty well I mean I can not ... I can supervise of course , but ... Alexander turn the vox back on . alexander Jason , we be go to test it . jason okay ... on what ? 70 , tommy how about the pig lizard ? jason hey , I be do okay with the pig lizard ... Alexander and the other move aside to let dusty at the control panel . the control be complicated , and fit dusty 's hand like two metal glove . teb gasp as he grasp the control . teb I be sorry . it be very exciting to see the master at the control . the operation of the conveyer be more art than science . dusty move he hand and the pig be targeted in crosshair of the instrument panel . he slowly twist he wrist as he manipulate a lever cautiously and .... on the planeta surface the pig lizard demolecularize and disappear . conveyor room everyone look very impressed . dusty start to smile , '' no sweat '' as the pig rematerialize on the conveyer pad . as it form , however , something be very wrong . we hear the pig lizard 's horrible squeal over the disgust reaction of the crew . jason what ? what ? alexander osingsong ) nothing . jason I hear something . a squeal . gwen oh no . everything 's fine . teb but ... the animal be inside out . jason I hear that ! it 's inside out ! then the monstrous remain of the pig lizard explode . teb +.- and it explode ! jason what ? do I just hear that it come back inside out , and then it exploded ? Alex ? gwen ? hello ? 71 . gwen hold on . ( to other ) what be we go to do ? planet surface Jason look up at the view window where the demon continue to chant . demon gorignak !... gorignak !... jason wait , the pig lizard be go . why be they still chant for the pig lizard ? gwen turn on the translation circuit . teb flick a switch and we hear the demon in English . demon rock ... rock ... rock ... suddenly gwen and the other notice that the entire rock face behind Jason move slightly , like a granite musculature ... Jason , face forward , do not see it . gwen Jason ? I do not think the pig be gorignak ... jason what the hell be you talk about ? behind Jason , the boulder in the wall begin move forward , emerging from the rock face , and a giant emerge ... a monster make of granite ... Jason turn slowly , with a feel of dread , as he hear the rumbling SOUND of the monster 's body freeing itself from the rock face around it . jason oh darn . he take a step back , hold he puny wooden spear . the rock monster step forward , 20 foot tall . its face mostly featureless yet ominous and determine and upset , and it head straight for jason . jason guy , molecularize I in ... Jason back away slowly , around the corner , but the monster follow crunch crunch forward ... jason guy ...7 !! int . ship - molecular conveyer room dusty look genuinely distress . 72 . dusty I can not . you see what happen ... gwen you have to . they base it on you hand movement . dusty back away , terror in he face ... he start talk to himself nervously ... dusty all my professional life they have say '' can you ride a horse '' dusty ? and I have say '' of course , be riding since I be a boy . '' '' can you fence dusty ? '' '' funny you should ask , I have win six international competition . '' I learn never to say I can not do something . you do not get the part if you say '' I can not do this . '' so I say '' sure !

I can not do this . dusty huddle in the corner , obviously no use to anybody . on the planet Jason be in a full out run be chase by the rock monster which stomp forward , demolishing everything in its path . the demon move from view window to view window excitedly , follow the pursuit . finally Jason run into a dead end . alexander dusty 's no good , Jason . you be go to have to kill it . the monster crunch forward , distract by a couple of pig lizard which scurry across its path . he grab they and put they in he rock mouth , squashing they . then turn back to Jason ... jason kill it ? well I '' open to idea !... guy go for the eye . like in episode 22 with the var-dragon ... or episode 46 with the - jason it do not have eye . guy the throat , the mouth ... its vulnerable spot . jason it 's a rock . it do not have vulnerable spot ! 73 . tommy I know ... you construct a weapon . look around , can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe ?... jason a lathe ??? get off the line , guy ! gwen ? gwen it 's really big , Jason ... jason thanks . helpful ! the monster take a step forward , its shadow fall over Jason .. jason alexander ??? please ? you be my advisor , advise I !
