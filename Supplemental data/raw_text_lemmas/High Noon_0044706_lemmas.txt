eigh noon by Carl Foreman base on a story by John M. cunningham producer : stanley Kramer director : Fred Zinnemann wi wewrSe wt 40 High noon some note asqut this story the time be about 1870 or 1875 . the place be hadleyville , population around 400 , locate in a western territory still to be determine , a town just old enough to have become pleasantly aware of its existence , and to begin think of {ts appearance . there be one street , a rambling , crooked affair that begin at the railroad station , meander along through the town , end a little way past the relatively new commercial Hotel , and then become a narrow and disappear path into the prairie . most of the people in town , particularly that in better eireumstance , have build house away from the street , end some of they even have small lawn and flower patch , most of they rather pathetic . between the station and the hotel be to be find the majority of the setting for the action of the story : the marshal 's office and the courtroom , the ramirez bar , the barber shop , the general store , the livery stable . other establishment that should be indicate but will not be use ( as of this write ) will be in tune with the place and period : Â«a bank , restaurant , rooming house , a millinery shop , a hand laundry , etc . almost all the building along the street have some kind of structure behind they , such as outhouse or shed or , in some case , live quarter . not so long ago , hadleyville , like many other frentier town that vere at the mercy of nearby feudal baron , have be terrorize by gil Jordan and he retainer . from he ranch , gil Jordan have rule hadleyville , and rule {t ruthlessly and eruelly . there be still man == and woman , too =~ who bear the physical mark of Jordan 's maniacal rage , five year ago , hovever , marshal will doane , back by a half a dozen harderide deputy , have break the Jordan gang and arrest Jordan for murder . at he trial , he have be sentence to hang , but Jordan 's influential friend in the territorial capital hed have he sentence commute to life imprison - ment . now , five year later , hadleyville be a safe place for vomen and child . Law end order have be so firmly establish that doane new have only two deputy . the people be marshal will doane , helen ramirez , amy doane , harvey pell and other . will doane be in he middle thirty . adequately educate , he be a second - generation westerner in a land thet be still spread out . like most of the other citizen of hadleyvilie , he be not a native of the town . he be direct , practical , aot too m2 ) 4 wi raagmom a man cee Fe ee mm 2 J 1 a ) mm ) te sse se gi a ) bs oy I es whd oy es High noon 41 articulate . his approach to the job cf peace officer be matter - or - fact , umtomantic , but in the five year that he have be town marshal be have alvay like it . he hes enjoy the prestige it have give bim , and the knowledge that he 1s respected and like by the townspeople . now that he be be marry , he be leave the job and the town with some regret , but secure in the feel that he be do the sensible thing {mn move to another town , where a general store should do good business . he {s , certainly , not a average man , cut a very human ome . some tvo year ago be have a somewhat lengthy affair with : helen ramirez . she be two or three year older than doane , a victim of a era and environment vith rigid social stand - ard . to begin with , helen be half mexican , end thus neither acceptable to the '' pure '' american vomen of the region , nor eligible for a " good " marriage . consequently , in eddition to be intelli - go , atrewd and strong - will , she be also hard and resentful . physically , she be handsome , full - treast , passionate . more , she have style , personality . some yeer ago , helen hed carry ramirez , the local salocn - keeper . after he death she hed become gil Jordan 's mistress , with Jordan in jail for lite , helen have herself select will deane as he successor , and helen still cannot forgive doane for end the lisscn , for this be a priviledge she reserve for herselr . recently , she have allow herself to drift into a affair with harvey pell , doane 's friend end deputy . a good business woman , she bas long since dispose of she interest in the ramirez saloon , ent ds a silent partner in the town 's general store . amy doane be , withoyt kmow it , one of the new vomen of the period , woman who be beginning to rebel against the limit - ation ani restriction of the victorian epoch . Young , attractive , iirtelligemt , strong - will , Amy be determine not to be a shelter toyewife but @ full partner in she merciage , and it be she who have plann they future . more , Amy have strong emotional emi intellectual . conviction against any form of violence , because ber father and brother vere kill while take part in vigilante action , end she have since embrace the quaker faith . marziage to doane would have be unthinkable have he remain a peace officer . harvey pell be young than deane , he deputy and friend . but beneeth that friendship be a nag sense of inferiority and a envy of deane . thus , although he have secretly take doane 's place as helen 's lover , he have a feel that he have oot really replace deane . in addition , harvey be ambitious , amicus to preve he manhood acd importance . he bas hope to be appoint mersbel in doane 's place , ami he have expect that deane would secure the position for he . since the promotion have not take place , he be resentful towards deane for this as well . yet , with all this , there be a remnant cf the old like . doane , however , be unaware of the change in harvey 's feeling toward hin . 42 High noon other be : percy mettrick , justice of the peace ; jonas henderson , william fuller and martin ecwe , selectmen ; milt jordan , pierce and colsy , remnant of the Jordan gang ; SAM , helen 's elderly retainer ; toby , doane 's other deputy ; and a surprising cumber of other bitg , mettrick be urbane , culture , cynical , unmarried , middle - age . benderson and fuller , and they wive , be in the same age category , and very solid citizen . mart howe be about sixty , a bachelor . he have be a peace officer all he life , but age and the arthritis that have crippled he hand have cause he retirement some year before , milt jordan , gil 's young brother , jame pierce and jack colby be all that remain of the Jordan bunch . milt be handsome , wild , with cruel eye and a quick , meaningless smile . colby be dour , remote , indrawmn . pierce , the oldest amd the leader , be a chronically sour-temper man , nervous and irritable . SAM 12 a thin , leathery , taciturn man about Martin hove 's age . he look as if he have know a considerable amount of viclence and hard - live ( and probably lawlessness ) in he time , from vhich -- like Mart howe -- he have retire , but in he own way . helen ramirez ia the only person in town += and perhaps the vorld << for whom he have any feel . you sense that he be intensely loyal and devote , that he understand and admire she , and that he {s content to be she watch - dog . dr . marin , the minister , be a sincere , devout , unworldly man , vho hag hia share of human veakness . toby , doane 's other deputy , be about harvey pell 's age . lack harvey 's tense drive , he be good - nature , easy - , oing , dependable in a fight . other character vill be descrite as have go along . how - ever , while have ere here , have omy es wall deserthe the setting for some of the scene to follow . this be : ( 1 ) the commercial Hotel , ( 2 ) helen ramirez 's room , ( 3 ) the courtroom , ( 4 ) the marshal 's office , ( 5 ) the ramirez bar , ( 6 ) the barbershop , ( 7 ) the livery stable , ( 8 ) the Church , ( 9 ) the reilread station , ( 10 ) Martin howe 's home , ( 11 ) willian fuller 's home , ( 12 ) the general store , and ( 13 ) mendosa 's place . the commercial HOTEL would seem to be about six year old . it be a tworstory building . the desk be in the center hall , on one side cf which be the small lobby , and on the other , cut orf from view by curtain or swinging door , the dining room . from the hall , a stairvey lead up to the second floor , where all room be enter from the ball . helen ramirez cecupy two connect room on the second floor of the hotel , toward the front . one be she bedroom and the other have be furnish as a kind of sit room or what ry fl to waa 74 27 3anoasa pe fi | y High noon 43 be call a front room then . the front room overlook che street . her taste be fairly expensive , feminine and god . will doane's office , which he share vith judge hattrick , ig e one - story building on the main street . on one wide of the office be the courtroom and on the other the jail .
