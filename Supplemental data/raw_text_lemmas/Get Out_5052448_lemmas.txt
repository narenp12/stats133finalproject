Brain transplantation . some say it could never be do ; jim ( cont 'd ) they experiment for century , but it turn out re-linking the brain to a foreign central nervous system be impossible . the nerve connection be far too intricate and delicate . 89 . CHRIS what the fuck ? jim Dean 's the only guy who really get the science . he 's the one who discover that full brain transplantation be not actually necessary to transfer the soul , and that partial brain transplantation solve the little nerve end problem . CHRIS no . Jim hold up a Color code diagram of the human Brain . there be a big red part that take up 80 % of the image . the other 20 % be blue and locate near the lower back of he skull . jim okay so ... you see the blue part ? that 's the piece of you brain that 's all roote in the nervous system . so that stay ; keep that tricky little connection intact . the rest be discard . then they will remove the red part of my brain from my skull and put in yours . you " blue " and my " red " basically absorb each other . and apparently the brain heal surprisingly fast , so assume everything go as plan , we should be up and function in a couple week . CHRIS and my brain ? jim you red part ? it will be discard , but do not worry . you wont be go . well not completely . you will still be in there somewhere ; limited consciousness of course ; jim ( cont 'd ) you will still be able to see and hear but you existence will be as a passenger ... a audience . you will live in ... 90 .
