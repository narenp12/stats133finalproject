SOUND of a alarm clock go off . Jim awaken , yawn himself into hazy consciousness , grope about on the night table for the clock ; it be not there . he slip out of bed , and rub he eye , blindly move toward the dresser . the circuitous path , which he accomplish with sleepy dexterity , entail go around the chaise lounge , just miss the ominously point edge of muriel 's dress table , deftly step over the low dress table chair and finally reach the chest of drawer upon which be the clock . he turn off the alarm and yawningly start back over the same path . we get the feel that Jim make this sleepy excursion every waking morning of he life . back at he bed , Jim sit down , and , yawn loudly , grope with he foot for he slipper . before he can find they , however , he begin to doze off and slowly tilt back toward the pillow , pull the cover over he . in a moment he be sound asleep . muriel 's arm automatically stretch out and shake Jim into consciousness . as he painfully reawaken and start to rise , muriel 's arm disappear . we get the impression that this , too , be a regular part of the blanding ' daily routine .

" simm ( indicate blueprint ) Far as I remember , that would be something in the back of the house . let 's just take a look . as he unroll the blueprint , Jim look suspiciously at muriel . she seem a little nervous . simm ah , here we be . it be not a closet at all . it 's off the back pantry ... Mrs. blanding ' little flower sink . jim oh ... Mrs. blanding ' little flower sink . simm ( to muriel ) you do not authorize any change , do you ? muriel ( defensively ) well ... they certainly be not change . jim what -- have -- you -- do ? muriel ( speak rapidly a little confuse ) I have not do anything ! and what I do be ... just nothing at all . jim what -- have -- you -- do ?! muriel well -- ( rattling off ) all I do be one day I see four piece of flagstone leave over from the porch that be just go to be throw away because nobody want they and I ask Mr. retch if he would not just put they down on the floor of the flower sink and poke a little cement between the crack and give I a nice stone floor where it might be wet with flower and thing . that be absolutely all I do . during the above speech simm sink into a chair , put he head in he hand and close he eye , a fact that be not lose on Jim . jim that 's all you do ? muriel absolutely . just four little piece of flagstone . simm ( to muriel ; wearily ) do you by any chance authorize a drain ? muriel ( verge of tear ) of course I do not . all I say be I want a nice stone floor and Mr. retch be just as nice as could be and say , " you be the doctor , " and that 's all anybody ever say to anybody about anything . Jim take a deep breath , turn to simm . jim ... well ? simm ( sigh ; plunging in ) all right , I think I can tell you what happen . first , the carpenter have to rip up the flooring that be already laid . that plank run under the whole width of the pantry , so retch have to knock the bottom out of the pantry wall to get at they . jim and muriel Jim and muriel - Jim look at muriel as though he be premeditate first - degree murder . she avert he gaze . over this : simm ' voice then he have to chop out the top of the joist under the flower sink space to make room for a cradle . I guess he buy some iron strap and fastened they to a big pan to give he something to hold the cement . what with that add load on the weaken joist , I will bet he have to put a lally column down there for support , too . muriel it be just four little piece of flagstone , and I only --- jim quiet ! group shot - during the following speech group shot - during the follow speech we see Bill Cole , in Jim 's pajamas and robe come down the stair and enter the room . Jim and muriel be not aware of he presence . simm well , the main soil pipe run under there on wall bracket , so retch have to get he plumbing man back to take out a section so he could get that cradle set . I guess that mean he have to change the pitch of the soil pipe from one end of the house to the other . ( look up ) ' Morning , Mr. Cole . bill ' Morning . hello , Jim . jim ( turn ) hello , Bill . Jim turn away , react , suddenly turn back to Bill , take in the pajamas and robe . a little shocked but unwilling to believe the implication of what he see , he look to muriel for a explanation . muriel ( lamely ) the bridge be roped off and Bill have to stay last night . jim ... oh . bill ( cheerily ) slept like a rock . jim I be delighted . Jim look at Bill , then back at muriel . simm ( clear he throat ) and then , of course , there be hot and cold water pipe hook to the joist right under that pantry . they go up to the wing bathroom on the second floor , and I will bet my bottom dollar he have to relocate they . three shot - jim , muriel and bill . three shot - Jim , muriel and Bill . Jim turn to listen but find himself look speculatively at muriel and Bill . simm ' voice and I guess the electrician have to rip out about sixty foot of armored cable between the main panel and the junction box by the oil burner , include the two hundred twenty volt cable that go to the stove . full shot - gussie appear in the doorway full shot - gussie appear in the doorway in raincoat , carry umbrella . gussie ' Morning , everybody . whew ! what a night ! jim where have you be ? gussie lansdale . could not get back across the bridge . jim you ... be not here last night ? gussie they be not let anybody across that bridge , Mr. blanding .

Bill exit . another pause . simm , aware of the tension , want to get out of there . simm ( rapidly ) well , that 's about the size of it -- through simm ' speech , Jim look darkly at muriel . simm -- except that retch have to repair the pantry wall and that mean get a plasterer back . and of course , he could not have break through that wall -- jim all right , simm , all right . we will take care of it . simm ( prepare to exit ) I will admit it 's a little steep . but I will try to get retch to knock a hundred dollar off the bill . if I can not get that , I will certainly try for seventy - five . jim Fine . simm if he do not go for seventy - five , I will take a stab at fifty . jim you do that . simm ( at the door ) anyway , I be almost sure we can get twenty - five . there be no answer . simm ( lamely ) well. good day . he leave . there be a deadly pause . muriel ( carefully ) now dear , you be upset , you have get a lot of thing on you mind -- jim ( with dangerous calm ) muriel , there 's only one thing on my mind -- this house -- and how fast we can get rid of it ! muriel that 's not what you be think . jim maybe it 's not . maybe I be think I be once a happy man !

Jim turn . jim ( sharply ) what do you want ?! a slight embarrassed pause . then : tesander ( shyly ) well , Mr. blanding , there 's a matter of twelve dollar and eighty - six cent . jim ( with a wild gleam ) twelve dollar and eighty - six cent ! why be a piker , Mr. tesander ? ( empty pocket ) take everything I have get ! spread it out among you pal !

Jim and muriel look at he curiously . bill you know , I have kind of be the voice of doom about this whole project . every step of the way I be firmly convinced you be get fleece , bilk , rook , flimflammed and generally take to the cleaner . and maybe you be . maybe it cost you a whole lot more than you think it would . maybe there be time when you wish you would never start the whole thing . but when I look around and see what you two have here -- I do not know .
