'' lipsky that 's not what I be say . david if we have do this interview through the mail ? and I have access to a library , and could look stuff up ? my dream would be for you to write this up , send it to I , and I get to rewrite all my quote - which of course you will never do . when I be in a room by myself , alone , and have enough time , I can be really really smart . do not get I wrong : I think I be bright ; I think I be talented .

I mean , you know , I can talk intelligently with you about stuff . but I can not quite keep up with you . lipsky that be such bullshit . david believe I : I be not just '' aw - shuck , I be just in from the country , I be not a real writer , I be just a regular guy . '' I be not try to lay some kind of shit . and I be - lipsky you just do it again ! you flatter I , but be you just be patronize ? david I just think to look across the room and automatically assume that somebody else be less aware than I , or that somehow they interior life be less rich , and complicated , and acutely perceive than mine , make I not as good a writer . lipsky why ? david because that mean I be go to be perform for a faceless audience , instead of try to have a conversation with a person . if you think that 's faux , then you think what you want . I have get a serious fear of be a certain way . and a set I think of like , real conviction about why I be continue to do this , why it 's worthwhile . why it 's not just a exercise in basically get my dick suck . and , you know what ? , this be a very clever tactic of yours : lipsky tactic , what tactic ? david get I a little piss off , a little less guard , I be gonna reveal more . 95 96 68. yes , it 's true : I treasure my regular - guy -ness ; I have start to think it 's my biggest asset as a writer , that I be pretty much just like everybody else . ( a beat . ) you know what ? I be not do any kind of faux thing with you ; I be not gonna say it again . lipsky okay , but the faux thing - what you just say - be a example of the faux thing . you do not want to take the risk of give the full you . david look , I do not know if you be a very nice man or not . it 's very clear that you do not believe a word I have say . lipsky all you protest ... '' I be just a regular guy . '' you do not crack open a thousand - page book ' cause you hear the author 's a regular guy . you read it because the author be brilliant . because you want he to be brilliant . so who the fuck be you kid ? david I do not have the brain cell leave to play any kind of '' faux '' game with you . lipsky Fine .

'' I have rather be dead . lipsky why ? david I do not want to be see that way . why , would you ? lipsky well , if you be derive you satisfaction from talk about you work , as oppose to write , then , yeah , I guess you have get a lot less do . david exactly . and there 's nothing more grotesque than somebody who 's go around , '' I be a writer , I be a writer , I be a writer . '' be that a dig at lipsky ? lipsky think so . david I do not mind appear in Rolling Stone , but I do not want to appear in Rolling Stone as somebody who want to be in Rolling Stone . if you see I like , you know , a guest on a game show in a couple of year ... lipsky laugh . pause . David be pensive again . david to have write a book about how seductive image be , and how many way there be to get seduce off any kind of meaningful path , because of the way the culture be now ...? what if I become this parody of that very thing ? lipsky look at David , who stare straight ahead , he eye maybe fill with tear . david tomorrow , you drive away , get ona plane , this be over . and I be back to know like twenty people . then I be go to have to like decompress from get all this attention . because it 's like get heroin injected into you cortex . that register with lipsky . 97 71 . david ( contd ) and where I be go to need real ball be to be able to sit and go through that . and try to remind myself that what the reality be : that I be thirty - four year old , and I be alone ina room with a piece of paper . they drive in silence . ext. / int . david be house - 1996 - night 97 the Grand be pull up , its headlight the only artificial light . the david get out and remove they bag .

I tell you that . it have nothing to do with drug . I mean , I be somebody who spend most of he life in library . I never live that kind of dangerous life . I would not even stick a needle into my arm . lipsky okay , so how do you think that rumor get start ? david I have no idea ! I have no idea . lipsky alright ... calm down ... 73 . david to tell you truly , if you structure this as some '' and then he spirale into some terrible addiction thing , '' it would be inaccurate . it be more like , I get more and more unhappy . the more unhappy I would get , the more I would drink . there be no joy in the drink . I use it for anesthesia . okay ? lipsky okay . what kind of drinker be you ? be you a fall - down drinker ? a waking -up-in-the-curb drinker ? david no , I be not ! okay ? part of my reticence about this whole thing be that it will not make very good copy for you . because , no , I be not like that at all ! lipsky you do agree to this interview . david I know that I do . lipsky alright , I be not gonna push much further . david I be also aware that some addiction be sexier than other . my primary addiction my entire life have be to television . I tell you that . now , television addiction be of far less interest to you reader than something like heroin , that confirm the mythos of the writer - lipsky a myth I do not believe , okay ? david I know you do not believe that . I be also aware that one of the thing swirl around here be you want the best fuck article you can have ! 100 101 74 . why do not you write whatever the fuck you want , but the fact of the matter be , it be not a lose weekend sort of thing . nor be it some lurid , romantic writer - as-alcoholic - sort - of -thing . what it be , be a 28 - year - old person who exhaust a couple other way to live , really take they to they conclusion . which for I be a pink room , with a drain in the center of the floor . which be where they put I for a entire day when they think I be go to kill myself . where you do not have anything on , and somebody 's observe you through a slot in the wall . and when that happen to you , you become tremendously ... unprecedentedly willing to examine some other alternative for how to live . David look at he for a moment . he walk out of the room , leave lipsky behind , he head reeling . lipsky press stop on the tape recorder . int . david' house / bathroom - 1996 - night 100 lipsky , still digest the conversation , look at himself in the mirror while brush he tooth . he spit into the sink . int . david' house / guest room - 1996 - night 10 lipsky be in bed , still awake in the moonlight . the door ajar , David come in . he speak softly , in shadow . he can not be see and can not see lipsky very well ; it 's sort of like confession . david you awake ? lipsky yeah . david I be just think ... it be not a chemical imbalance , and it be not drug and alcohol . it be much more that I have live a incredibly american life . that , '' if I could just achieve X and y and Z , everything would be ok . '' ( a beat . ) 102 103 104 75 . there 's a thing in the book : when people jump out of a burn skyscraper , it 's not that they be not afraid of fall anymore , it 's that the alternative be so awful . and then you be invite to consider what could be so awful , that leaping to you death seem like a escape from it . I do not know if you have have any experience with this kind of thing . but it 's worse than any kind of physical injury . it may be what in the old day be know as a spiritual crisis . feeling as though every axiom of you life turn out to be false , and there be actually nothing , and you be nothing , and it be alla delusion . and that you be better than everyone else because you see that it be a delusion , and yet you be worse because you can not fuck function . and it 's really horrible . ( a beat . ) I do not think we ever change . I be sure there be still that same part of I . I have just get to find a way not to let they drive . y'know ?
