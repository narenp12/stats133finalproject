Barton look back down at he typewriter as if to resume work , but the sound be too insistent to ignore . wide shot the room , Barton sit at he desk , stare at the wall . the laughter . Barton push he chair back , go to the door , open it and look out . he Pov the empty hallway , a pair of shoe before each door . at the end of the hall a dim red bulb burn over the door to the staircase , punctuate the sick yellow glow of the line of wall sconce . the laughter , though still faint , be more resonant in the empty hall . perhaps its quality have change , or perhaps simply because it be so insistent , the laughter now might be take for weep . Barton pause , try to interpret the sound . he slowly withdraw into he room . he room Barton look down at he typewriter for a beat . the laughter / weep continue . he walk over to he bed , sit down and pick up the house phone . barton hello ...

Charlie laugh . charlie caught I try to be fancy ! yeah , that 's it , Bart . barton well , that 's a good question . strange as it may seem , Charlie , I guess I write about people like you . the average work stiff . the common man . charlie well be not that a kick in the head ! barton yeah , I guess it be . but in a way , that 's exactly the point . there 's a few people in New York '' hopefully we number be grow '' who feel we have a opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience , create a theater for the mass that 's base on a few simple truth '' not on some shopworn abstraction about drama that do not hold true today , if they ever do ... he gaze at Charlie . barton ... I do not guess this mean much to you . charlie Hell , I could tell you some storey '' barton and that 's the point , that we all have storey . the hope and dream of the common man be as noble as that of any king . it 's the stuff of life '' why should not it be the stuff of theater ? goddamnit , why should that be a hard pill to swallow ? do not call it new theater , Charlie ; call it real theater . call it we theater . charlie I can see you feel pretty strongly about it . barton well , I do not mean to get up on my high horse , but why should not we look at ourselves up there ? who care about the fifth Earl of bastrop and Lady higginbottom and '' and '' and who kill Nigel grinch - gibbon ? charlie I can feel my butt get sore already . barton exactly , Charlie ! you understand what I be say '' a lot more than some of this literary type . because you be a real man ! charlie and I could tell you some storey '' barton sure you could ! and yet many writer do everything in they power to insulate themselves from the common man '' from where they live , from where they trade , from where they fight and love and converse and '' and '' and ... so naturally they work suffer , and regresses into empty formalism and '' well , I be spout off again , but to put it in you language , the theater become as phony as a three dollar bill . charlie yeah , I guess that 's tragedy right there . barton frequently play , seldom remark . Charlie laugh . charlie whatever that mean . Barton smile with he . barton you be all right , Charlie . I be glad you stop by . I be sorry if '' well I know I sometimes run on . charlie Hell no ! Jesus , I be the kind of guy , I will let you know if I be bored . I find it all pretty damned interesting .

Charlie be get to he foot and walk to the door . charlie well Christ , if there 's any way I can contribute , or help , or whatever '' Barton chuckle and extend he hand . barton sure , sure Charlie , you can help by just be yourself . charlie well , I can tell you some storey '' he pump Barton 's hand , then turn and pause in the doorway . charlie ... and look , I be sorry as hell about the interruption . too much revelry late at night , you forget there be other people in the world . barton see you , Charlie . Charlie close the door and be go . Barton go back to he desk and sit . muffled , we can hear the door of the adjacent room open and close . Barton look at the wall . he Pov the bathing beauty . from offscreen we hear a sticky , adhesive - give - way sound . barton he look around to the opposite '' bed '' wall . he Pov the wallpaper be lightly sheen with moisture from the heat . one swath of wallpaper be just finish sagging away from the wall . about three foot of the wall , where it meet the ceiling , be expose . the strip of wallpaper , its glue apparently melt , sag and nod above the bed . it glisten yellow , like a fleshy tropical flower . back to barton he go over to the bed and step up onto it . he smooth the wallpaper back up against the wall . he look at he hand . he hand sticky with tacky yellow wall sweat . he wipe it onto he shirt . we hear a faint mosquito hum .
