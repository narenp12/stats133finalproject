Bob cratchit close the office in a twinkle . ext . london STREET a coatless , shiver Bob cratchit lock the front door and rush off with the long end of he white comforter dangle below he waist . int . tavern scrooge eat a melancholy dinner in a melancholy tavern ; the newspaper he have just read lie in a stack on he table ; he study he banker 's - book . ext . scrooge's build a dark and threaten building . nobody life in it but scrooge , the other room be all let out as office . the yard be so dark that scrooge grope with he hand through the fog and frost to the black old doorway of the house on which be a fairly large knocker . scrooge put he key in the lock of the door and glance at the knocker . without its undergo any intermediate process of change , the knocker be no longer a knocker , but marley 's face . scrooge gasp . scrooge ( whisper ) marley ? marley 's face . not in impenetrable shadow as the other object in the yard be , but with a dismal light about it , like a bad lobster in a dark cellar . not angry or ferocious , the face look at scrooge as marley use to look : with ghostly spectacle turn up upon its ghostly forehead ; the hair curiously stir , as if by breath or hot -air ; eye wide open but perfectly motionless . that , and its livid colour , make it horrible ; but its horror seem to be in spite of the face and beyond its control , rather than a part of its own expression . as scrooge let go of the key and stare fixedly at this phenomenon , it become a knocker again . startle , scrooge put he hand upon the key , turn it sturdily , walk in , and light he candle . int . entry hall scrooge pause to look cautiously behind the door , as if he half expect to see marley 's pigtail stick out into the hall . but there 's nothing on the back of the door , except the screw and nut that hold the knocker on . scrooge close the door with a bang . the sound echoe through the house like thunder . he fasten the door , walk across the hall , and up the stair , slowly , trimming he candle as he go . int . the stair a grand old flight of stair , very wide , very dark . scrooge peer up into the darkness and , for a moment , he think he see a something that look like a hearse go on before he in the gloom . he pause , blink , shake he head , then continue , mutter to himself . int . scrooge's room - montage a suspicious , slightly unnerve scrooge walk through he gloomy suite of room -- sit - room , lumber-room , bed-room -- to be sure that everything 's all right . in the sit - room , he find nobody under the table , nobody under the sofa ; a small fire in the grate ; spoon and basin ready ; and a little saucepan of gruel ( scrooge have a cold in he head ) upon the hob . lumber-room as usual . Old fire - guard , old shoe , two fish - basket , wash - stand on three leg , and a poker . bed-room as usual . nobody under the bed ; nobody in the closet . suddenly , he see a ghostly white shape in the darkness on the opposite side of the room . scrooge tense up for a moment until he realize it 's only he dress - gown , hang up in a suspicious attitude against the wall . quite satisfied , he close he door , and lock himself in ; in fact , he double - lock himself in , not he custom . secure against surprise , he return to the bed-room , take off he cravat and start to put on he dress - gown , slipper , and night - cap . int . scrooge's sitting -room have change clothes , scrooge sit down before the fire to take he gruel . it 's a very low fire and scrooge sit close to it . the fireplace be a old one , build by some dutch merchant long ago , and paved all round with quaint dutch tile , design to illustrate the scripture . cain and abel , pharaoh 's daughter , queen of sheba , angelic messenger descend through the air on cloud like feather - bed , abraham , belshazzar , apostle put off to sea in butter - boat , hundred of figure . scrooge take a mouthful of gruel and glance at the fireplace . flash CUT of every tile adorn with marley 's face as it be on the door-knocker . scrooge blink -- and see that the tile have return to normal . scrooge rise and pace the room , feel unsettle . after several turn , and more than a few nervous glance at the fireplace , he sit down again . as he throw he head back in the chair , he glance happen to rest upon a bell , a disus bell , that hang in the room . as he look , the bell begin to swing . it swing so softly at the outset that it scarcely make a sound ; but soon it ring out loudly , and for the next twenty second , so do every bell in the house . throughout , a uneasy look slowly cross scrooge 's face . all at once , the bell cease . scrooge relax , but only for a moment : a clanking noise come from deep down below , as if some person be drag a heavy chain over the cask in the wine - merchant 's cellar . the sound of a downstairs door fly open with a booming sound , and then the clanking noise much louder , on the floor below ; then come up the stair ; then come straight towards he door . scrooge start talk to himself . scrooge it 's humbug still ! I will not believe it . the colour leave scrooge 's face though , when , without a pause , the source of the noise come on through the heavy door , and pass into the room before scrooge 's very eye . upon its come in , the die flame leap up in the fire - place and fall again . the same face : the very same . jacob marley' ghost in he pigtail , usual waistcoat , tight , and boot ; the tassel on the latter bristle , like he pigtail , and he coat-skirt , and the hair upon he head . a wrapper , a fold kerchief be bound about marley 's head and chin . a long chain be clasped about he middle , wound about he like a tail ; and make of cash - box , key , padlock , ledger , deed , and heavy purse wringht in steel . marley 's body be transparent so that scrooge , observe he closely , can look through he waistcoat and see the two button on he coat behind . scrooge feel the need to crack a joke to keep down he terror . scrooge ( softly ) I would often hear it say that you have no heart , marley , but I never believe it until now . scrooge stare into the ghost 's death - cold eye and revert to he cold and caustic self . scrooge how now ! what do you want with I ? marley much ! scrooge who be you ? marley ask I who I be . scrooge who be you then ? marley in life I be you partner , Jacob marley . scrooge ( doubt fully ) can you -- can you sit down ? marley I can . scrooge do it , then . marley sit down on the opposite side of the fireplace , as if he be quite use to it . scrooge stare at the ghost 's fix , glaze eye as it sit perfectly motionless though its hair , and skirt , and tassel , still quiver as if by the hot vapour from a oven . marley you do not believe in I . scrooge I do not . marley what evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of you sense ? scrooge I do not know . marley why do you doubt you sense ? scrooge because a little thing affect they . a slight disorder of the stomach make they cheat . you may be a undigested bit of beef , a blot of mustard , a crumb of cheese , a fragment of a underdone potato . there 's more of gravy than of grave about you , whatever you be ! you see this toothpick ? scrooge hold up a toothpick . the ghost 's eye do not move . marley I do . scrooge you be not look at it . marley but I see it , notwithstand . scrooge well ! I have but to swallow this , and be for the rest of my day persecute by a legion of goblin , all of my own creation . humbug , I tell you ; humbug ! at this , the spirit raise a frightful cry , and shake its chain with such a dismal and appall noise , that scrooge hold on tight to he chair , to save himself from fall in a swoon . marley start take off the bandage round its head , as if it be too warm to wear in - door . when marley 's lower jaw drop down to he breast , scrooge fall on he knee , and clasp he hand before he face . scrooge mercy ! dreadful apparition , why do you trouble I ? marley man of the worldly mind ! do you believe in I or not ? scrooge I do . I must . but why do spirit walk the earth , and why do they come to I ? marley it be require of every man that the spirit within he should walk abroad among he fellow - man , and travel far and wide ; and if that spirit go not go forth in life , it be condemn to do so after death . it be doom to wander through the world -- oh , woe be I ! -- and witness what it cannot share , but might have share on earth , and turn to happiness ! again marley raise a cry , and shake he chain , and wring he shadowy hand . scrooge you be fettere . tell I why ? marley I wear the chain I forge in life . I make it link by link , and yard by yard ; I gird it on of my own free will , and of my own free will I wear it . be its pattern strange to you ? scrooge tremble more and more . marley or would you know the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself ? it be full as heavy and as long as this , seven Christmas eves ago . you have labour on it , since . it be a ponderous chain ! scrooge glance about he on the floor , in the expectation of find himself surround by some fifty or sixty fathom of iron cable : but he see nothing . scrooge Jacob . Old Jacob marley , tell I more . speak comfort to I , Jacob . marley I have none to give . it come from other region , ebenezer scrooge , and be convey by other minister , to other kind of man . nor can I tell you what I would . a very little more , be all permit to I .

I have sit invisible beside you many and many a day . scrooge shiver at this , and wipe the perspiration from he brow . marley that be no light part of my penance . I be here to - night to warn you , that you have yet a chance and hope of escape my fate . a chance and hope of my procure , ebenezer . scrooge you be always a good friend to I . thank'ee ! marley you will be haunt ... by Three spirit . scrooge 's jaw drop almost as low as marley 's have do . scrooge be that the chance and hope you mention , Jacob ? marley it be . scrooge I -- I think I would rather not . marley without they visit , you can not hope to shun the path I tread . expect the first to -morrow , when the bell toll one . scrooge could not I take them all at once , and have it over , Jacob ? marley expect the second on the next night at the same hour . the third upon the next night when the last stroke of twelve have cease to vibrate . look to see I no more ; and look that , for you own sake , you remember what have pass between we . scrooge venture to raise he eye again , and find he supernatural visitor confront he in a erect attitude , with its chain wound over and about its arm . marley take he wrapper and wrap it round its head , as before . scrooge wince at the click sound marley 's tooth make , when he jaw be bring together by the bandage . marley walk backward from he ; and with every step , the nearby window raise itself a little , so that when the ghost reach it , it 's wide open . he beckon scrooge to approach , which he do . when they get within two pace of each other , marley hold up he hand , warning he to come no nearer . scrooge stop , not so much in obedience , as in surprise and fear : for on the raise of the hand , he become sensible of confuse noise in the air ; incoherent sound of lamentation and regret ; wailing inexpressibly sorrowful and self - accusatory . marley , after listen for a moment , join in the mournful dirge ; and float out the window into the bleak , dark night . scrooge follow to the window : desperate in he curiosity . he look out . ext . scrooge's build the foggy air be fill with phantom , wander hither and thither in restless haste , and moan as they go . every one of they wear chain like marley 's ; some few ( they might be guilty government ) be link together ; none be free . many have be personally know to scrooge in they life . one old ghost , in a white waistcoat , with a monstrous iron safe attach to its ankle , cry piteously at be unable to assist a wretched woman with a infant , whom it see below , upon a neighbor door-step . the misery with they all be , clearly , that they seek to interfere , for good , in human matter , and have lose the power for ever . whether this creature fade into the mist , or the mist enshroud they , be unclear . but they and they spirit voice fade together ; and the night become as it have be when scrooge walk home . int . scrooge's sitting -room scrooge close the window , and examine the door by which the ghost have enter . it 's still double - lock , as he have lock it with he own hand -- the bolt be undisturbed . he try to say " humbug ! " but stop at the first syllable . int . scrooge's bed-room scrooge close he bed- room door and cross to he bed . without undress , he get in , and fall asleep instantly . the light from the fire in the sit - room be visible under the close bed- room door . dissolve to : int . scrooge's bed -room scrooge awake in darkness , some time later . the fire have go out in the sit - room . as the chime of a neighbour church strike twelve , scrooge count with he finger . scrooge twelve ? it be past two when I go to bed . scrooge scramble out of bed , and grope he way to the window . he rub the frost off with the sleeve of he dress - gown but all he can make out be that it 's very foggy and very quiet . scrooge hmmph ! clock must be wrong . icicle must have get into the work . scrooge light a candle and sit on the edge of he bed , look at he bedside alarm clock . it read twelve . scrooge twelve ! why , it be not possible . I can not have sleep through a whole day and far into another night . he pick up the clock and check it , then seem to remember something . narrator ( voice over ) now , of course , the ghost have warn Mr scrooge that a spirit would visit he when the bell toll one ... scrooge appear to make a decision of some kind and begin to fiddle with he clock . narrator ( voice over ) ... so he resolve to lie awake until the hour be past ; and , consider that he could no more go to sleep than go to Heaven , this be perhaps the wisest decision he could make . naturally , he do not want to be catch doze off , so he make sure to set the alarm on he clock to go off precisely at one . scrooge set the alarm , draw open all the bed-curtain so he may keep a sharp look - out on the room , and sit up in bed -- wait for he visitor . dissolve to : int . scrooge's bed-room about a hour later . scrooge , warily sit up in bed , watch the clock tick to one . the tinny alarm bell go off . scrooge look around the room . nothing . scrooge bah ! he sigh -- whether in relief or disappointment or embarrassment , it 's hard to tell -- blow out the candle , glance at the door where , the fire have go out , no light shine through from the sit - room . scrooge draw all the bed-curtain shut , curl up under the cover , and with a peaceful , satisfied look on he face , shut he eye . a long pause . the church bell sound with a deep , dull , hollow , melancholy one . scrooge 's eye pop open and a wave of dread pass over he face . a wickedly bright light flash up in the room , and the curtain of scrooge 's bed be instantly draw aside . scrooge , start up into a half - recumbent attitude , find himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who draw they : it 's a weird , impressive figure -- like a child : yet not so like a child as like a old man , view through some supernatural medium , which give he the appearance of have recede from the view , and be diminish to a child 's proportion . its hair , which hang about its neck and down its back , be white as if with age ; and yet the face have not a wrinkle in it , and the tenderest bloom be on the skin . the arm be very long and muscular ; the hand the same , as if its hold be of uncommon strength . its leg and foot , most delicately form , be , like that upper member , bare . it wear a tunic of the purest white . round its waist be bound a lustrous belt , with a beautiful sheen . it hold a branch of fresh green holly in its hand ; and , in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem , have its dress trim with summer flower . from the crown of its head there spring a bright clear jet of light , by which all this be visible ; and which be doubtless why it use , in its duller moment , a great extinguisher for a cap , which it now hold under its arm . its belt sparkles and glitter now in one part and now in another . and it be continuously morph : what be light one instant , at another time be dark , so the figure itself fluctuate in its distinctness -- be now a thing with one arm , now with one leg , now with twenty leg , now a pair of leg without a head , now a head without a body -- of which dissolve part , no outline be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melt away and then re-form , distinct and clear as ever . scrooge be you the Spirit , sir , whose come be foretold to I ?

I have see you nobler aspiration fall off one by one , until the master - passion , gain , engross you . have I not ? ebenezer what then ? even if I have grow so much wiser , what then ? I be not change towards you . Belle shake she head . ebenezer be I ? belle we engagement be a old one . it be make when we be both poor and content to be so , until , in good season , we could improve we worldly fortune by we patient industry . you be change . when it be make , you be another man . ebenezer ( impatiently ) I be a boy . ' tis true , I be not now what I be then . belle I be . that which promise happiness when we be one in heart , be fraught with misery now that we be two . how often and how keenly I have think of this , I will not say . it be enough that I have think of it , and can release you from we engagement . ebenezer have I ever seek release ? belle in word ? no. never . ebenezer in what , then ? belle in a change nature ; in a alter spirit ; in another atmosphere of life ; another hope as its great end . in everything that make my love of any worth or value in you sight . if this have never be between we , tell I , would you seek I out and try to win I now ? ah , no ! he seem to yield to the justice of this supposition , in spite of himself . ebenezer you think not . belle I would gladly think otherwise if I could , Heaven know ! when I have learn a Truth like this , I know how strong and irresistible it must be . but if you be free to -day , to -morrow , yesterday , can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl -- you who , in you very confidence with she , weigh everything by gain : or , choose she , if for a moment you be false enough to you one guide principle to do so , do I not know that you repentance and regret would surely follow ? I do ; and I release you from we engagement . with a full heart , for the love of he you once be . a pause . he be about to speak ; but with she head turn from he , she resume . belle you may -- the memory of what be past half make I hope you will -- have pain in this . a very , very brief time , and you will dismiss the recollection of it , gladly , as a unprofitable dream , from which it happen well that you awoke . May you be happy in the life you have choose ! abruptly , she rise and leave he . scrooge Spirit ! show I no more ! conduct I home . why do you delight to torture I ? the ghost of christmas past one shadow more ! scrooge no more ! no more . I do not wish to see it . show I no more ! but the relentless ghost pinion he arm , and turn he 'round to observe : int . belle' sitting - room - night a room , not very large or handsome , but full of comfort and Christmas decoration . all be quiet . falling snow be visible out the window . near the fireplace , sit a beautiful young girl , nearly identical to Belle . Belle herself , now a comely matron , be also by the fire -- sit opposite she daughter . scrooge gaze upon they in awe , particularly the daughter . narrator ( voice over ) I suspect it must have staggered Mr scrooge to see this woman , especially the young one , because have he play he card differently , a woman such as she might well have call he father , and be like a spring - time for he in the haggard winter of he life . ( beat ) of course , he might well have have more than one child ... nearly a dozen child explode into the room , make a tumultuous noise , but no one seem to care ; on the contrary , the mother and daughter laugh heartily , and enjoy it very much ; and the latter mingle with they and get clobbere ruthlessly . they stream around a startle scrooge , run , jump and play with enormous energy . narrator ( voice over ) -.. oh , what would I not have give to be one of that child ! though I never could have be so rude , no , no ! I would not for the wealth of all the world have behave so wildly , God bless my soul ! upon a knock at the door , the child stampede immediately , and the daughter be borne towards it in the centre of the flushed and boisterous group , just in time to greet they father , who come home laden with Christmas toy and present . shout and struggle , the kid swarm they father , belle' husband : scale he , with chair for ladder , to dive into he pocket , despoil he of brown - paper parcel , hold on tight by he cravat , hug he round the neck , pummel he back , and kick he leg in irrepressible affection ! they shout with wonder and delight at each package they receive . Belle have rise from she chair to watch the proceedings and happen to stand next to scrooge who watch she and she family closely , no doubt ponder what might have be . dissolve to : int . belle' sitting -room later that evening . gift -wrap litter the floor . the child have go to bed and all be quiet again . scrooge and the ghost look on as Belle 's husband , have he eldest daughter lean fondly on he , sit down with she and she mother at the fireside ; the husband turn to he wife with a smile . belle' husband Belle , I see a old friend of yours this afternoon . belle who be it ? belle' husband guess ! belle how can I ? tut , do not I know . ebenezer scrooge . belle' husband scrooge it be . I pass he office window ; and as it be not shut up , and he have a candle inside , I could scarcely help see he . his partner lie upon the point of death , I hear ; and there he sit alone . quite alone in the world , I do believe . scrooge , sit beside the ghost on the far side of the room , shut he eye and shake he head . scrooge spirit ! remove I from this place . the ghost of christmas past I tell you this be shadow of the thing that have be . that they be what they be , do not blame I ! scrooge remove I ! I can not bear it ! scrooge turn upon the ghost , and see that it look at he with a oddly morph face , in which there momentarily appear fragment of all the face it have show he : he young selve , fan , the fezziwigs , Dick Wilkins , Belle , etc . terrify , scrooge physically attack the ghost . scrooge leave I ! take I back . haunt I no longer ! the ghost offer no visible resistance of its own but remain undisturbed by scrooge 's attack , the light from its head burn high and bright ; scrooge seize the extinguisher - cap from under its arm and press it down upon the ghost 's head . the ghost seem to shrink beneath it , so that the extinguisher cover its whole form ; but though scrooge press it down with all he force , he can not hide the light , which stream from under it , in a unbroken flood upon the ground . in a last great effort , he throw the whole of he body atop the cap and the light go out . blackness . int . scrooge's bed-room the room be dark -- no light shine under the bed-room door from the sit - room . scrooge -- in roughly the same position we last see he -- lie in he bed atop he pillow . in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore , scrooge awaken with a start and sit up in bed . he light he candle and look around . his bedside clock read five minute to one . narrator ( voice over ) now , marley 's ghost have warn scrooge that a second spirit would haunt he at the stroke of one . I do not mind tell you that scrooge be now prepare for a good broad field of strange appearance , and that nothing between a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished he very much . by this time , he be ready for almost anything ... from the church clock , the chime strike one . scrooge steel himself . narrator ( voice over ) ... but , you see , he be not by any mean ready for nothing ... and nothing be exactly what happen . after a lengthy pause , scrooge check he clock , sigh and , with a last look around , blow out the candle and lie down on the bed . suddenly , he bolt straight up -- stare at he bed- room door . Light be again stream in from the sit - room . scrooge get up softly and shuffles in he slipper to the door . his hand be on the lock when a voice from the sit - room call out . voice scroooocoge ? come in , scrooge ! a tremble scrooge open the door and enter : int . scrooge's sitting -room it 's he own room , but it 's undergone a transformation . the wall and ceiling be so hang with live green , that it look a perfect grove ; from every part of which , bright gleam berry glisten . crisp leave of holly , mistletoe , and ivy reflect back the light like so many little mirror ; and a mighty blaze roar in the fire-place . heaped up on the floor , to form a kind of throne , be turkey , geese , game , poultry , brawn , great joint of meat , suck - pig , long wreath of sausage , mince - pie , plum -pudding , barrel of oyster , red-hot chestnut , cherry - cheek apple , juicy orange , luscious pear , immense twelfth - cake , and seethe bowl of punch , that make the chamber dim with they delicious steam . in easy state upon this couch , there sit a jolly giant , glorious to see : who carry a glow torch , in shape not unlike plenty 's horn , and hold it up , high up , to shed its light on scrooge , as he come peeping round the door . the ghost of christmas present come in ! come in and know I better , man ! scrooge enter timidly . the Spirit 's eye be clear and kind , but scrooge do not look at they . the ghost of christmas present I be the ghost of Christmas present ! look upon I ! scrooge do so . the ghost wear a simple green robe , or mantle , border with white fur , hang so loosely on the figure , that its capacious breast be bare , as if disdain to be ward or conceal by any artifice . its foot , observable beneath the ample fold of the garment , be also bare ; and on its head it wear no other cover than a holly wreath , set here and there with shine icicle . its dark brown curl be long and free : free as its genial face , its sparkling eye , its open hand , its cheery voice , its unconstrain demeanour , and its joyful air . gird round its middle be a antique scabbard ; but with no sword in it , and the ancient sheath be eat up with rust . the ghost of christmas present you have never see the like of I before ? scrooge never . the ghost of christmas present have never walk forth with my elder brother bear in this later year ? scrooge I do not think I have .

( to Old Joe ) look here , old Joe , here 's a chance ! if we have not all three meet here without meaning it ! old joe you could not have meet in a better place . come into the parlour . you be make free of it long ago , you know ; and the other two be not stranger . stop till I shut the door of the shop . he shut the door which creak badly . old joe ah ! there be not such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinge , I believe ; and I be sure there 's no such old bone here , as mine . ha , ha ! we be all suitable to we call , we be well match . come into the parlour . come into the parlour . they follow he into : int . the parlour a space behind a screen of rag . Old Joe rake the fire together with a old stair-rod , and have trim he smoky lamp , with the stem of he pipe , put it in he mouth again . while he do this , the charwoman throw she bundle on the floor , and sit down in a flaunt manner on a stool ; crossing she elbow on she knee , and look with a bold defiance at the other two . charwoman what odd then ! what odd , Mrs dilber ? every person have a right to take care of themselves . he always do ! laundress that 's true , indeed ! no man more so . charwoman why then , do not stand stare as if you be afraid , woman ; who 's the wiser ? we be not go to pick hole in each other 's coat , I suppose ? laundress no , indeed ! undertaker we should hope not . charwoman very well , then ! that 's enough . who 's the worse for the loss of a few thing like this ? not a dead man , I suppose . laundress no , indeed ! charwoman if he want to keep them after he be dead , a wick old screw , why be not he natural in he lifetime ? if he have be , he would have have somebody to look after he when he be strike with death , instead of lie gasp out he last there , alone by himself . laundress it 's the truest word that ever be speak . it 's a judgment on he . charwoman I wish it be a little heavier judgment , and it should have be , you may depend upon it , if I could have laid my hand on anything else . ( turn to Old Joe ) open that bundle , old Joe , and let I know the value of it . speak out plain . I be not afraid to be the first , nor afraid for they to see it . we know pretty well that we be help ourselves , before we meet here , I believe . it 's no sin . open the bundle , Joe . but the undertaker mount the breach first and produce he plunder of which there 's not much : a seal or two , a pencil -case , a pair of sleeve - button , and a brooch of no great value . Old Joe examine and appraise they and then chalk up he ask price for each , upon the wall , and add they up into a total . old joe ( to the undertaker ) that 's you account , and I would not give another sixpence , if I be to be boil for not do it . who 's next ? the laundress be next . sheet and towel , a little wear apparel , two old - fashioned silver teaspoon , a pair of sugar - tong , and a few boot .

Strike , shadow , strike ! and see he good deed spring from the wound , to sow the world with life immortal . under the voice over : scrooge glance towards the phantom . its steady hand point to the cover head . scrooge hesitantly approach the dead man and attempt to uncover its face . but he cannot bring himself to do so . his hand shake and he back away . a cat meow somewhere in the dark . scrooge , he face drip with sweat , turn to the phantom . scrooge Spirit ! this be a fearful place . in leave it , I shall not leave its lesson , trust I . let we go ! still the phantom point with a unmove finger to the head . scrooge I understand you and I would look at this dead man 's face , if I could . but I have not the power , Spirit .
