Jeff lift he hand , gesture at the path . lead into the tree . jeff ( cont would ) come on . we be almost there . the other glance at one another , wait for someone to argue ; no one do . finally , Mathias step forward , slip through the narrow open . Eric follow he , and then , with just the slight hesitation , so do Amy and stacy . Jeff throw one last glance toward the boy -- who 's still stand there , sixty foot away , watch with he anxious expression -- and then he , too , vanish into the tree . ext . narrow path - moving - day they make they way along the wind path , one after another , all of they sweat , slapping at the mosquito . eric maybe the ruin be sacred . you know ? and they do not want people digging they up . he glance about , off into the tree , a little spook . eric ( cont would ) we could be walk through some sort of ancient graveyard right now . and they have -- 29 . jeff it 's a mine . a old mining camp . eric so ? jeff there 's nothing sacred about it . Eric consider this as they walk . the other be also quiet : too hot to speak . the sunlight fall through the tree in thin , shifting column , haze with mosquito . eric maybe it lead to a marijuana field , then . maybe the village be grow pot , and that boy ride off to get they , and they be gonna come with gun and -- amy Eric . eric what ? amy shut up , okay ? Eric fall silent . they follow the path as it curve first right , then leave , move gradually uphill all the while , and suddenly there 's sunlight in front of they , bright and intense : a clear . they hesitate at its edge , stare . ext . clearing / base of the hill - day the clear be twenty yard wide , and extend in either direction as far as the eye can see , finally curving out of sight . its soil be a deep black , fleck with white , like frost rime . it 's completely free of vegetation . the path resume on the far side of the clear , wind its way up asmall hill . the hill be rocky , oddly treeless , and cover with a vinelike growth -- a vivid green , with hand - shape leave and tiny red flower . Jeff and the other step warily out onto the clear ground , peer about , squinting in the sudden sunlight . they stare up at the flower - cover -hill . 30 . there be hint of ruin among the thick foliage : giant boulder with faint carving etched onto they surface , the crumble remain of a fall pillar , everything half - bury beneath the vine . stacy it 's beautiful . amy so beautiful . stacy and the mosquito be go . you realize that ? they have stop bite . she smile at the other , delighted by this development . Amy remove the cap from she camera , start to take picture . amy Pov - through the viewfinder we hear a click as she take each photo , and the image freeze for a instant . there 's the hillside , cover in its vine , its red flower : click . there 's Eric pull the water bottle from he pack : click . there 's stacy smile at we , wave : click . there 's Mathias shading he eye , peer up the hill . amy ( o.s.} smile , Mathias . mathias be that a tent ? he point . back to scene Amy lower she camera , turn to look . amy Pov - up the hill a orange square of fabric be just visible , at the very top of the hill , billow , sail - like , in the breeze . from this distance , with the rise of the hill partly block the view , its hard to tell what it be . 31 . back to scene they all stand there , peer up the hill . faintly , but grow steadily louder , a thudding noise come from the jungle . the five of they turn , head cocked , listen . jeff a horse . it 's true : hoofbeat be approach at a gallop . instinctively , Jeff and the other back a handful of step toward the hill . a long. beat , then a horseman burst into the clear , rear to a halt . Amy lift she camera . amy Pov - through the viewfinder a bald mayan man be on the horse ; he 's broad - shoulder , short , in he early forty , dress in a white shirt and pants . the horse rear a second time , and the image freeze for a instant , with a click , as Amy snap another picture . back to scene the bald man shout at they in unsubtitled mayan . his horse be lather , snorting , roll its eye . it rear yet again , and the man half - fall , half - jump to - the ground . Jeff and the other back a few more step into the clear . amy Pov - through the viewfinder the bald man be still hold the rein ; the horse be back away from he , jerk its head , try to break free , pull he , step - by-step , back toward the trail . click . back to scene the man can not gain control of the horse . finally , he drop the rein , and the horse gallop into the jungle , crashing through the tree , its hoofbeat gradually diminish . the man turn toward they , start yelling in mayan again , point back down the trail . sweat shine on he forehead . there 's a gun on he belt , a black pistol in a brown holster . stacy be clutching Eric 's arm , look frighten . stacy what 's he say ? 32 . eric maybe he want money ? a toll or something ? the mayan continue shout , wave he arm . Jeff reach into he pocket , pull out he wallet , remove a twenty . jeff dinero ? the man ignore the proffer bill , make a shooing motion , wave they from the clear . Mathias turn toward the hill , cup he hand around he mouth , shout : mathias henrichi there 's no response , just the orange fabric gently billow . jeff why do not you hike up , see if you can find he ? we will try to sort this out . Mathias nod , start across the clear . the bald man shout at he in mayan , and then , when Mathias do not stop , pull he pistol from its holster , fire into the sky . everyone flinch , half -ducking . stacy scream . Mathias go still . the man wave at he , yelling in mayan , and Mathias come back , he hand raise , to join the other . hoofbeat be approach from the jungle again . they come closer and closer , and suddenly two more horseman burst into the clear . they be young than the bald man in they twenty , dark - haire , muscular . one have a mustache . they mount be white - eye , snorting , rear , just like the bald man' . the two man jump to the ground , drop they rein , and the horse immediately turn and gallop back into the jungle . Amy lift she camera again . amy Pov - through the viewfinder the young man have bow sling across they chest , and quiver of thin , fragile - look arrow . they question the bald man in mayan , very rapidly . he 's still aim he pistol at Mathias . a click , and the image freeze for a instant . 33 . back to scene as they continue to interrogate the bald man in mayan , the young man unsling they bow , each of they nock a arrow . reflexively , Jeff and the other retreat another handful of step into the clear . Mathias still have he hand raise . eric what the fuck ? jeff quiet . eric they 're -- jeff wait . wait and see . Amy be a bit farther into the clear than Jeff and the other . she keep swinging she camera from they to the mayan , try to capture the whole scene in one shot . she 's too close , though , - and she retreat another handful of step . amy Pov - through the viewfinder still back up toward the hill ; all of they but stacy and Eric be in the frame now . the bald mayan be still answer the young man 's question . he turn toward we suddenly , point he pistol directly at we , .start to shout . back to scene Jeff and the other turn , too , stare at Amy in surprise . she 's nearly at the far edge of the clear , peer through she camera ; she retreat another step . the young mayan raise they bow , draw they ; the bald man keep yelling . jeff amy -- she take another step ; she 's right up against the vine . amy Pov - through the viewfinder stacy be in the frame now . we retreat one more step , and so be Eric , and the mayan with they raise weapon , the bald man still shout : everything freeze on the click . 34 . back to scene Amy lower she camera . the mayan with the mustache turn to the other two , point toward she foot , spear urgently . the bald mayan slowly lower he pistol , look dismay . Amy glance down . amy Pov - her feet she 's step out of the clear , into the flowering vine . back to scene both of the young mayan be speak now , they voice rising . the bald mayan be shaking he head , protest , but they talk right over he . Amy step clear of the vine , start back toward Jeff , and the young mayan draw they bow taut again , aim at she chest . she freeze . amy jeff --- Jeff lift he hand , without look , he eye on the mayan . jeff do not move . the bald man continue to frown and shake he head . he point to Amy , then the other ; he wave toward the jungle . but the young man be implacable -- they keep argue , gesture -- and finally the bald man give in , fall silent . a beat , then the bald man raise he pistol , aim it at Jeff 's chest . he make a shooing motion with he other hand , but now it 's toward Amy , and the hill beyond she . he begin to shout ; the other man do , too . then the bald man fire a bullet into the dirt at Jeff 's foot . everyone jump , start to retreat . the man with the bow be swinging they back and forth , herding they toward the hill . when Jeff and the other reach Amy , the bald man point toward the trail , wave they up it . he watch -- he expression look stricken , close to tear -- as the five of they obediently begin to climb the vine- cover hill . ext . hillside - day midway up the hill , they pause to catch they breath . 35 . jeff check you phone , Eric . Eric pull out he phone , flip it open , stare at it . eric nothing .. he snap it shut . they stand there : sweat , scared look . Mathias cup he hand to he mouth again , shout : mathias henrich ... I they all peer up the hill , wait for a response . eric be Pov -- up the hill it be a tent : bright orange , look a bit worse for wear . the vine be grow up its aluminum pole as if on a trellis . . the tent face away from we ; its doorway be hide . there 's no sign or sound of any people . back to scene Eric turn , glance back down the hill , shield he eye . eric there 's another one . he point toward the clear below they . eric' Pov the clearing a fourth man have arrive , on a bicycle . he 's dress in white , like the other , with a straw hat on he head . a beat , then two more mayan appear , also on bicycle . they all have bow sling over they shoulder . the bald man address this newcomer . he wave in either direction , and the other man start off along the clear , two one way , three the other , leave he alone at the base of the hill . a beat , then a little boy appear from the jungle -- the one who would watch they discover the camouflage path . he and the bald man stand there , peer up at we . 36 . back to scene Eric turn to the other , excite : eric let 's run back down . Quick . while there 's just he and the kid . we can rush they . stacy he 's get a gun , Eric . this silence eric--silence all of they . Mathias turn , shout toward the tent again . mathias henrich ... 1 there 's no answer . they wait another beat , then Jeff wave they back into motion . ext . hilltop - day the hill be flat on top , form a wide plateau . Beyond the orange tent be a small clear of rocky ground . a blue tent sit on the far side of the clear , look just as weathered as the orange one , the vine grow up its pole . the five of they pause , peer about . Jeff call out : jeff hello ...? silence . the vine cover everything but the trail and the clear . we glimpse more rubble beneath its greenery : time - wear stelae , a low stone wall . in some place the vine fold back upon itself , form waist - high mound , tangle knoll - like profusion of green . and everywhere , hang off it , be that bright red flower . Mathias move toward the orange tent , and Jeff follow he . they unzip its flap , stoop to peer inside . jeff' Pov - inside - the orange tent the vine have take root in here , too , grow on some thing , leave other untouched . there be three sleep bag unroll on the floor . a oil lamp . two backpack . a roll of duct tape . a bottle of tequila . a metal canteen . 37 . back to scene Jeff and Mathias zip the flap back shut . Eric , stacy and Amy be fifteen foot away , watch . eric what 's inside ? jeff nothing . some camp supplies . Mathias start across the clear toward the blue tent , follow by Jeff and the other . he unzip its flap , stick he head inside . Jeff lean to look , too . jeff' Pov - inside the blue tent the same thing : sleep bag , backpack , camp supplies . the vine be grow on some thing , but not on.other . back to scene ten yard beyond the tent , there 's a hole cut into the dirt . stacy , Amy , and Eric have gather at its edge ; Jeff and Mathias join they . the hole be rectangular - - ten foot by six foot -- and very deep ; we can not see its bottom . a windlass have be construct beside the hole , a horizontal barrel with a hand crank weld to its base . rope be coiled around the barrel . from there , it pass over a small wheel , which hang from a sawhorse straddle the hole 's mouth . then it drop straight into the earth . amy the mine ? Jeff nod . a draft be rise from the hole , and it lift off Amy 's hat . she try to catch it , but fumble : the hat fall away from she . they all watch it vanish into the dark . Eric pull out he phone , flip it open , almost absentmindedly : a nervous gesture . there 's still no signal . he close it , turn to survey the clear , the empty tent . eric now what ? Jeff shrug , wave past the shaft . the clear end just a few yard from they ; 38 . then the vine resume , and in the midst of the vine be the path . it wind its way to the edge of the hilltop , vanish over it . jeff keep go , I guess . say this , he sling he pack onto he shoulder . then he start forward , the other fall in behind he . ext . hillside - day they pick they way down the trail . it 's much steeper on this side ; there be short stretch where they have to drop onto they rear end and slide , one after another . it 's after one of this that Jeff suddenly stop , stare . jeff' Pov - the bottom of the hill it look as if the jungle have be chop down all the way around the base of the hill , isolate it in a ring of barren soil . one of the mayan have make he way along this clear ground to the base of the trail . he 's stare up at they . eric ( o.s. ) fuck . the man slide he bow off he shoulder , nock a arrow . he shake he head at they , call out in mayan , wave they away . back to scene the five of they stand there , stare down at the man . stacy what do we do ? Jeff shrug , start forward again . jeff we will see . the other hesitate , and then , one after another , resume they downward march . ext . base of the hill - day as they approach the clear , the mayan man yell what sound like someone 's name . 39 . a beat , then another bowman come jogging into view . Jeff and the other stop at the bottom of the trail . they stand there , stare . the vine have invade the clear here . ten foot in front of the path be one of that odd , knoll - like growth , knee-high , thick with flower . the two mayan be another twenty foot beyond it , in the center of the clear , bow draw . amy so. her skin be slick with sweat , and she 's wind from the hike down . a third mayan come jogging toward they . he stop beside the other two , draw he bow . eric we should rush they . all at once . stacy shut up , Eric . eric or go make shield . if we have some shield , we could -- he fall silent as another mayan come run toward they . along the clear . this one be bearded , heavier than the other . and he 's carry a rifle . any oh my god . Jeff be stare at the little isolate island of vine , ten foot in front of they -- peer intently at it . stacy let 's go back up . Jeff take a step forward into the clear -- slowly , warily . stacy ( cont would ) I wanna go back . Jeff take another step , edging toward the mound , he eye on the mayan , they raise weapon . they just watch he . any jeff -- he ignore she , take a third step , then a forth , which bring he to the mound of vine . he crouch , reach into the tendril , parting they . he grasp a stalk , tug , pull it free . we see a tennis shoe , a sock , a man 's shin . 40 . Jeff turn , stare at Mathias , who step forward , crouch beside he , start to pull at the vine , gently at first , then more aggressively , tear they , the plant 's sap shine on he skin , a low moan rise from he chest . another shoe be reveal , another leg , a pair of jeans , a belt buckle , a black T-shirt . and then , finally : a young man 's face , the flesh oddly eat away , so that he cheekbone be visible , the white socket of he leave eye . amy ( cont would ) oh , no . oh , Jesus . Jeff hold up he hand , silencing she . the mayan stand there , in the center of the clear , watch . Mathias have begin to rock slightly , that moaning come and go . Jeff touch he shoulder , whisper : jeff easy . all right ? easy and slow . we will stand up and we will walk away . we will walk back up the hill . the young man 's T-shirt be stiff with dry blood . there be . three slender arrow impale in he chest . mathias it 's my brother . jeff I know . mathias they kill he . Jeff nod , he hand still on Mathias 's . shoulder ; he squeeze . jeff shh . not here . up the hill , okay ? Mathias be struggle to control he breathe ; the moan keep come . finally , he manage a nod , and they both stand up . stacy and Amy be hold hand , look stricken . stacy have start to cry . Eric have he arm around she . the mayan keep they weapon raise . they watch in silence as Jeff and the other turn to start back up the hill . ext . hilltop - day Jeff and Mathias be at the top of the trail , stare down toward the clear . 41 . jeff' Pov - the bottom of the bill more mayan be appear from the jungle . they be all armed . the bald man send they out along the clear , some in one direction , some ' the other . back to scene Jeff and Mathias stand there , grim -face , watch . Mathias lift he hand , stare at they . they have turn a deep , raw - meat red , as if scar . he flexe he finger , wince . ext . hilltop - the clearing - day Amy , stacy , and Eric sit in the clear , beside the shaft , pass a bottle of water among themselves . Eric be struggle to calm the girl : eric we can sneak past once the sun ... -' set , I bet . you know ? just reep by they in the dark ? stacy and Amy hardly seem to hear he ; they look daze , distraught . Eric pass the bottle to stacy . a beat , then : eric ( cont would ) and then there 's the girl . amy the girl ? eric the one he brother meet . what happen to she ? Amy and stacy be silent . stacy lift the water bottle to she lip , but immediately lower it , and start to cry again . Amy take she hand . Eric watch they , silent . then : eric ( cont would ) and the archaeologist . you think -- stacy 's cry deepen toward a sob . Amy give Eric a look . amy stop it , Eric . eric what ? 42 . amy just stop , okay ? stop talk . stacy struggle to collect herself , breathe deep . she wipe at she face . Amy keep stroking she hand . Jeff and Mathias be approach across the hilltop . Mathias hold he burn - look hand out in front of he . he 9 a no Jeff crouch beside the other . eric what happen ? Jeff take the bottle from stacy . he pour a tiny bit of water on Mathias 's hand . jeff there 's something in the plant . the sap -- it burn he skin . Mathias rub at he hand with he shirt , grimace . Amy reach to take the water back from Jeff . she start to lift the bottle to she mouth , but .. teff lean forward , grab it . jeff ( cont would ) do not . we need to save it . amy but I be thirsty . jeff we all be . amy so let 's drink . Jeff shake he head , capping the bottle . jeff we do not have that much . we need to ration it . ( he glance up at the sky ) we will have to figure out a way to catch the rain . everyone but Amy peer up at the sky : it 's a perfect , cloudless blue . Amy remain focus on Jeff . amy I be hungover . I be sunburn . I lose my hat . I need some water . 43 . jeff amy -- amy why do you get to decide ? Jeff stare at she , consider this . then he shrug . jeff Fine . let 's vote . ( he glance at the other ) but first you should understand that each of we be gonna need half a gallon of water a day , at a minimum , to survive here . that 's two and a half gallon total , every day . and right now , until it rain , we do not have it . okay ? not even one day 's worth . ( a beat ) now who want to give Amy more water ? a long moment of silence . no one can meet Amy 's eye . finally , very quietly : stacy maybe we should just wait , honey . any till ? everyone look toward Jeff . jeff another hour or so . then we will all have a sip . okay ? Amy can see that she have no choice . she give a grudge nod , and Jeff slide the bottle into he knapsack . jeff ( cont would ) we have to get organize . now . while we be still fresh . we will have to stay out of the sun , spend as much time as possible in the tent . we will have to -- stacy can not we sneak away when it get dark ?

Jeff shake he head , cut she off . he wave across the hilltop , toward where he and Mathias have be stand . jeff they keep come . more and more of they . they be all armed , and the bald one send they out along the clear . they be surround we . Amy , stacy and Eric struggle to absorb this . finally : eric why do not they just kill we ? jeff it 's get something to do with the hill , I think . once you step on it , you be not allow off . something like that . they will not step on it themselves , but now that we be here , they will not let we leave . so we have to figure out a way to survive till someone come and find - we . amy who ? Jeff lift one hand , palm - up , half a shrug . jeff people will start to worry when we do not return home . right ? and they will -- amy we be not suppose to leave till Friday . Jeff nod . amy ( cont would ) and they will have to come search . again , he nod . amy ( cont would ) so you be talk -- what , a week ? . jeff something like that . Amy look appal ; she voice jump : 45 . amy we can not live here for a week , Jeff . jeff if we try to leave , they will shoot we . that 's the one thing we know for certain . a electronic chirping come from the shaft : it sound like a cell phone ringing . Mathias turn he head , listen . no one else notice it . amy but what will we eat ? how will we -- the ringing come again , silencing she . she glance toward the shaft , not quite believe what she 's hearing . it come a third time , and they all stand up , step to the hole , peer into its darkness . the ringing come yet again . stacy a cell phone . amy it can not be -- jeff that 's a cell phone , Amy . definitely . . amy but there 's no signal out here . Eric can not get a signal . reflexively , Eric pull out he phone , check again : nothing . there 's another ring . jeff it could be a different network . something local . amy Way down in that hole ? how could it pick it up ? still another ring . eric what else can it be ? 46 . the ringing fall silent . they all stand there , stare into the hole . a long beat , then it resume . Eric clap he hand , ecstatic . the other be start to smile , too . Mathias move to the windlass . he unroll some of the rope , start to wrap it around he chest . Jeff watch he . another ring . the vine have take root on the windlass : - the sawhorse , the barrel , the rope . Jeff step forward , begin to yank it off , careful not to get the sap on he hand . he turn to Amy . jeff there 's a lamp in the orange tent . see if you can find some match , too . Amy hurry off toward the orange tent , vanish inside . there 's a final ring , and then silence again . Mathias be knotting the rope tightly around he chest . Amy return , carry a oil lamp , a box of match . everyone watch as Jeff crouch to light the lamp . then he rise , turn toward Mathias , look at he closely . jeff ( cont would ) you sure ? Mathias nod , take the lamp , step to the edge of the hole . Jeff and Eric move to the windlass ; they position themselves at the hand crank , lean into it , so the rope go taut . Mathias gird himself , step out over the hole . he dangle there for a moment , hang beneath the sawhorse , the windlass groaning on its mount . then Jeff and Eric begin to reverse the crank , let the rope slowly spool out . stacy and Amy stand beside the shaft , peer into it , watch as Mathias begin he descent -- ten foot , twenty foot , thirty foot down , and still only darkness beneath he , with no sign of the shaft 's bottom . the windlass creak as it turn ; Jeff and Eric strain against it , sweat , muscle taut . Amy have turn from the shaft , be watch : the rope as it slowly unspool from the barrel . amy Jeff . he turn to look , and she point at the rope , where it come off the windlass and angle up toward the little wheel hang from the sawhorse . 47 . amy ( cont would ) the sap ... they would clear off most of the vine from the rope , but not all of it . some of this remain tendril have be crush as the windlass slowly unspool . they sap be darken the rope in spot , eat into it . amy ( cont would ) I think it 's -- Jeff immediately turn back to the crank , he voice urgent : jeff pull he up ! Eric have not grasp what 's happen . he hesitates . jeff ( cont would ) nowt Amy jump forward to help , all three of they push at the crank , get in each other 's way , the windlass creaking as it begin to turn again , slowly reclaim the rope . stacy remain beside the shaft , peer anxiously into it . stacy Pov - the shaft Mathias be twenty - five foot beneath we , just beginning to bump he way upward , sway back and forth . he stare up at we , confuse : mathias what be it ? the rope beneath the sawhorse be be visibly eat away , its hemp unravel . back to scene stacy turn toward the other , point , terrify . stacy it be -- the rope swap . Jeff , Eric and Amy fall forward , the windlass spin wildly behind they , free 'of its weight . a long beat , then there 's a distant , hollow - sounding thump , follow instantly by the pop of the lamp shatter . stacy lean to peer into the shaft , she hand over she mouth . 48 . stacy Pov - the shaft darkness . silence . stacy ( o.s. ) Mathias ...? her voice echoes back at we . there 's no response . back to scene Jeff , Eric , and Amy join stacy at the edge of the shaft , all of they stare down into the darkness , look horrify . eric oh , Jesus . oh , fuck . amy be he -- there 's a groan from below , very faint , almost inaudible . jeff he 's moan . they listen for a beat , but there 's only silence . jeff ( cont would ) I hear he moan . the other do not seem so certain ; Jeff turn to the girl . jeff ( cont would ) one of you will have to go . amy go ? Jeff nod , wave into the shaft . jeff down . we will clear the vine off the rope . and you can -- amy why can not you ? or Eric ? jeff we have to work the crank . you will not be strong enough . 49 . Amy and stacy stare at each other ; it 's obvious neither of they want to go . stacy be the one who finally give in . stacy I can do it . amy ( relieved ) you sure ? stacy nod , but she do not look sure . she 's hugging herself ; it seem as if she might start tremble . before anyone can speak , that groaning come from the shaft again , louder this time , unmistakable . Jeff cup he hand , shout : jeff Mathias ...? more silence . Jeff turn to the girl . jeff ( cont would ) see if you can find a knife . and another lamp . ' he wave they toward the tent ; then he and Eric begin to unspool the rope from the windlass , lay it out across the clear in long , looping circle . ext . clearing / base of the hill - day the mayan keep come : woman now , too , bear bundle on they back . they be set up a campsite along the edge of the jungle . the bald man stand in they midst , he hand on he hip , stare silently up the hillside . cu - oil lamp the scratch of a match be light : Amy 's hand come into frame , lift the lamp 's glass chimney , fire the wick . jeff ( 0.s. ) just help he into the sling . then we will pull he up . the chimney be carefully replace , as we pull back to reveal : ext . hilltop - the clearing - day Amy be crouch , adjust the lamp 's flame . Jeff and Eric have mend the rope . 50 . we see the excise length of spoiled hemp , and the rag - look knot on the rope itself , which have be spool once more around the windlass . they have fashioned a sling at the rope 's end . Jeff and Eric be help stacy into it , pull it over she head , adjust it under she armpit . jeff once we get he out , we will drop the rope back down and pull you up , too . Amy offer stacy the lamp . stacy be scared , yet struggle not to show it . her hand be tremble , and the lamp rattles as she take it . the boy be step toward the windlass ; Eric stop , glance back at she . eric you okay ? stacy nod , but without much conviction . Eric step toward she , give she a tight hug . he hold she eye for a moment , kiss she . then he join Jeff at the hand crank . they lean against it , and the rope go taut . stacy step out into the open air over the shaft , the lamp in she right hand . with she leave hand , she lunge , grab at the sawhorse , cling tightly to it . Jeff glance toward she from the hand crank . jeff ready ? she nod , but do not relinquish she grip on the sawhorse . jeff ( cont would ) you have to let go , stacy . for a moment , it do not seem like she will be able to , but then -- with a visible act of will -- she do , and they slowly . begin to let the rope out , drop she into the shaft . on stacy - in the sling she grip the sling with one hand , the lamp with the other . wooden support have be hammer into the wall of the shaft , buttress the dirt . the vine cling to they , its leave and flower paler than on the hillside above . stacy begin to swing , pendulum - like , as she descend . she try unsuccessfully to steady herself , then glance up . 51 . stacy Pov - above her we be steadily drop : thirty foot down , then forty . Amy be at the edge of the shaft , peer in at we . she wave . back to scene stacy smile up at she . she start to wave back , but be too scared to let go of the sling . she glance down . stacy Pov - beneath her the light be sway back and forth with stacy , and it cause the shadow beneath we to jump and lurch . there 's still no sign of the bottom ; the windlass continue to creak . a beat , and then , very faintly , Mathias 's dim shape start to emerge : he white tennis shoe , he pale blue T-shirt . the lamp pick up bit of break glass around he body . back to scene stacy lift the lamp , peer downward , struggle to see more clearly , and the sling suddenly jerk to a halt , make she squawk . she look up . stacy Pov - above her the creaking have stop . we be swinging slowly back and forth . we see Amy peer down toward we : a long way up , almost seventy foot . a beat , then Jeff appear , too . jeff stacy ? his voice have a echo to it . back to scene - stacy her face be slick with sweat ; it shine - in the lamp light . stacy what ? jeff ( o.s. ) . it 's the end of the rope . 52 . stacy I be not at the bottom . jeff ( o.s. ) can you see he ? stacy look down again , hold up the lamp , peer toward Mathias 's motionless body . she lift she head . stacy a little . jeff ( o.s. ) be he conscious ? stacy I can not tell . I do not think so . jeff ( o.s. ) how far be you above he ? stacy glance down once more , try to quess , the distance . stacy Fifteen foot ? ( a beat ) he 's just lie there . she lift she head again , peer upward . stacy Pov - above her the top of the shaft be empty . very faintly , we hear Jeff and the other talk , just they voice , not they word . stacy ( o.s. ) Jeff ... ? Jeff 's head reappear . jeff we have to figure out a way to lengthen the rope . we be gonna pull you up . he pull he head away . back to scene - stacy she 's stare upward . 53 . stacy wait ! the rope have almost stop its sway . ext . hilltop - the clearing Jeff step back to the hole , peer into it . so do Amy .

Amy lift it , and they start into : the underground passage stacy be in front , with Amy right behind she . the torch shudder weakly in the steady draft ; the shaft 's ceiling be low enough that they have to crouch as they move forward . there 's a fourth ring , draw they deeper down the passage . 96 . the tendril hang from the ceiling brush against they . the vine be grow on the floor , too -- knee- deep -- and from the wall on either side . Amy be move cautiously , squinting into the darkness , and stacy start to pull ahead . amy wait ... she pause , lift the torch , but stacy keep go .

Three of the man sit face the hillside , they bow in they lap . the other be bedding down beneath the tree . the laughter echoe down the hill , eerie and ghoulish , yet the mayan betray no reaction to it , as if it be no more worthy of note to they than the steady rasping of the locust in the jungle at they back . 109 . int . orange tent - night Jeff , stacy and Amy lie side - by-side in the darkness . the liquid rattle of Mathias 's breathe come from the clear , sounding as if someone be saw at a tin can . Jeff and stacy be asleep ; Amy be stir restlessly , shifting first onto one side , then the other . finally , she rise , move toward the flap , slip quietly through it . ext . hilltop - the clearing - night the moon be out , drop its faint light upon we . Mathias be on he backboard beneath the little lean - to , more audible than visible , with he phlegm-clotted breathe . Eric be beside he . he look up as Amy emerge from the tent . any now be he ?

Eric and Amy both jump up . stacy have start to cry , shaking she head , mortified : stacy oh , god ... oh please no ... Jeff bend close to Mathias 's face , listen ; he check Mathias 's neck for a pulse . a beat , then he turn toward the other , shake he head . stacy begin to sob : stacy ( cont would ) I be sorry ... I be so sorry ... Eric reach , take she into he arm , hugging she . ext . clearing / base of the hill -- from up the hill - dawn the hillside fall away from we , the narrow trail wind down its face to the clear and the wall of jungle beyond . the sun be just rise , and the vine seem to shimmer in it . Three of the mayan encampment be visible from here : one directly beneath we , one to the leave , another to the right . thin ribbon of smoke rise from they campfire . ext . hilltop - top of the trail - day Jeff stand there , stare down toward the jungle . Eric and stacy be sit together in the clear behind he , hold hand ; stacy be still crying softly . Amy approach across the hilltop , stop beside Jeff . jeff they must have salted the soil . that 's the only way I can think . he turn , glance at Amy . she have no idea what he 's talk about . he wave down toward the mayan . 116 . jeff ( cont would ) to keep the ground clear . it grow so quickly ... he gesture at they clothes , upon which that green webbing of vine continue to spread , eat away at the fabric . jeff ( cont would ) it 's old , too -- have to be . really old . because the bird , the insect ... somehow they have evolve . they have learn not to land here . ( he peer about they , at the vine - cover hill ) and the horse . remember ? how frighten they be ? they know , too . they stand in silence for a beat , stare down the hill toward the mayan . then Amy reach , touch Jeff 's arm . amy it do not happen . Jeff turn , stare at she . she wave back toward the tent . amy ( cont would ) Eric and I , we be just --- jeff I know . amy and what she say . about spring break .

Amy give he a confuse look . Jeff throw out he hand , . gesture at the hilltop , the vine , they tatter clothes . jeff ( cont would ) look at we . ( a beat ) would it matter to you ? Amy hesitates , consider . then she shake she head . and with that , Jeff turn , start back toward the orange tent . we hear a zipping sound , which carry over into : ext . hilltop - the clearing - day Jeff be crouch beside the backboard , unzipping the sleep bag . Eric toss the flimsy lean - to aside , expose Mathias 's corpse - to the sun . Amy and stacy stand watch . jeff head first ? Eric consider this , stare down at Mathias 's body . Mathias 's face be burn red from the vine 's sap ; he leg be two blacken stump . Eric shrug . eric I guess . jeff you will have to lift he . Eric hesitates ; he seem reluctant to touch the corpse . finally , he gird himself , straddle the backboard , grab Mathias under he armpit , lift he . Jeff lean forward , start to pull the sleep bag over Mathias 's head . the corpse seem intent upon resisting they ; its arm keep get tangle , catch and snagging . Jeff and Eric have to wrestle with it , both of they panting , sweat , before they manage to shove it into the bag . Jeff zip the bag shut , and they stand over it , catch they breath , wiping the perspiration from they face . eric should we say something ? 118 . Jeff give he a blank stare . eric ( cont would ) like , you know ...a prayer ? Jeff frown down at the bag , search for word . before he can find they , stacy speak : stacy where 's the knife ? they all turn . her hand be under she tatter shirt , press at she lower back . Jeff sigh : jeff stacy -- she lift she shirt , twist to show he . it look as if a large starfish have be implant just beneath she skin . it 's move , too , inching slowly but visibly downward . they all stare in astonishment . Amy gasp , point at stacy 's leg . stacy bend to see : there 's more vine here , a snakelike lump wind its way upward from the top of she shin to she inner thigh . cu - FIRE another small pile of clothes , burn with that blue , alcohol - fuel flame . amy ( o.s. ) can I give she some ? the knife be place in the fire , and we pull back to reveal : ext . hilltop - the clearing - day Amy hold up the bottle of tequila . Jeff be crouching over the fire , heating the knife 's blade . be glance toward she , nod . stacy be sit down , stare at the bulge in she leg with a daze expression . Eric be beside she . Amy offer the bottle to stacy ; - they all watch as she take a long swallow . then she hand the bottle back to Amy , and Jeff pull the knife from the fire , carry it toward she . he gesture to Eric and Amy . jeff hold she hand . 119 . they each take one of she hand . Jeff crouch over she leg . jeff ( cont would ) you might want to shut you eye . stacy shake she head . stacy I want to see . Jeff hesitates ; for a moment it seem - as if he might argue . but then , very quickly , he lean forward and draw the knife in one smooth movement up and around stacy 's leg . stacy moan , she body tensing , but she do not cry out . the incision reveal the vine , a foot long , its leave and flower clotted with stacy 's blood , which be ooze from the wound . Jeff reach in , pries the tendril from she flesh . stacy moan again , arching backward , as the vine emerge : writhe and twist . the blood come more thickly now , pump from the wound , run down she leg . Jeff drop the tendril into the dirt , step on it , grind it into stillness . stacy be breathe hard , almost hyperventilate . she 's shut she eye . jeff should I stop ? stacy shake she head , vehemently . Jeff glance at the other . Eric shake he head , too . Amy 's eye , like stacy 's , be tightly shut . jeff ( cont would ) you will have to roll over . stacy let go of the other ' hand , roll onto she stomach . she hitches up she shirt , revealing the small of she back , the starfish - shape bulge . Jeff crouch at she side . jeff ( cont would ) ready ? she nod , and he lean , make five quick incision , in the shape of a asterisk , directly above the bulge . stacy 's body go rigid , and Eric take she hand again . once more , we can see the tendril through the incision : dark with she blood . Jeff reach in and slowly pull the vine from she body . there 's a astonish amount of it ; he have to drop the knife and use both hand to drag the slimy mass free . 120 . as the plant emerge from she body -- thrashing , coiling and uncoil , cover in half - clotted blood , like a newborn -- stacy start to scream . ext . clearing / base of the hill - day the mayan at they campsite : three of they on guard duty , the other napping in the shade beneath the tree . stacy 's scream echoe down the hill toward we . ext . hilltop - the clearing - day they have pull a shirt from one of the backpack , tear it into strip , and use this to bandage stacy 's wound , tie they around she leg and torso . she 's lie on she side , eye shut , she head in Eric 's lap . he 's stroking she hair .

( he wave toward the tent ) get out of the sun . we be lose moisture out -- stacy there 's more of it . she lean forward , probe at she right thigh , prodding the skin . the other watch she ; there 's no bulge visible , no sign of the vine - at all . Eric give she a pain look . eric there 's nothing there , stacy . stacy it 's under the muscle . down by the bone . 121 . she keep push at she leg . she glance from Eric to Amy to Jeff . no one say anything . stacy ( cont would ) cut I and see . right here . she use she finger to draw a line up she thigh . jeff you be lose too much blood . and if any of this get infect --- stacy my calf , too . she lift she right leg , turn it to show the other . Jeff bend to look . again , there 's no visible sign of the vine . he shake he head . jeff no more cut . not unless --- the knife be in the dirt beside he , and stacy lean forward , try to grab it . Jeff be too quick for she , though : he snatch it up , tuck it into he belt . stacy be become more and more upset . she hold out she hand , begging : stacy please , Jeff . eric you can not . you can not keep -- stacy be start to cry ; she mouth be tremble . stacy it 's everywhere . she 's prodding at she body : she leg , she chest and stomach . Amy scoot toward she , grasp she hand . any stacy -- stacy yank she hand free , clutches she scalp , weeping : stacy it 's in my head ! I can feel it in my head ! Amy take stacy in she arm , hugging she tight .. 122 . amy shh. stacy sob into Amy 's shoulder , she body jump . Amy stroke she . Eric step across the clear , pick up the bottle of tequila . he glance at Jeff , and Jeff nod . amy ( cont would ) you be scared , honey . you be just scared . you know ? stacy nod ; she 's still crying , but it 's grow quieter . Eric crouch beside she , hold out the bottle of tequila . stacy just stare at it . Amy encourage she : amy ( cont would ) it will help . stacy accept the bottle , take a long swallow . then another . the other watch she in silence . finally : amy ( cont would ) can you rest some ? in the tent ? stacy be silent . she wipe the tear from she face . stacy that girl -- ( she wave at the shaft ) I keep see she . when I shut my eye . amy ( nodding ) I know ... I know . ( she stand up , hold out she hand ) let 's just lie down for a bit . okay ? stacy hesitates , stare up at Amy . then she reach , grasp she hand . Amy pull she to she foot , help she hobble across the clear to the tent . Jeff and Eric sit -there , watch in silence as they vanish through the flap . int . orange tent - day sunlight filter through the orange nylon ; all four of they lie sleep in a row , sweat . the vine have shred they clothes to tatter ; they look like castaway . the tent 's flap hang open , billow gently in a slight breeze . 123 . stacy open she eye . she lie there , stare up toward the orange nylon above she . the blood on she bandage have dry to a dark red , border on black . she sit up , stare about the tent . Eric be on one side of she , then Amy , then Jeff . Jeff be on he back , the knife still tuck into he belt . stacy rise quietly , step over Amy , crouch above he , stare down at the knife . she reach , try to slip it free , but then jerk back when Jeff shift in he sleep . she hesitates , watch he . she seem as if she 's about to try again , but then the tent flap billow in the breeze , draw she gaze . a beat , and she rise , step carefully over Jeff , duck outside into the clear . ext . hilltop - the clearing - day stacy stand just beyond the tent 's.flap . all be still , quiet . - she move to Eric 's pack , crouch over it , pull out he phone . she flip it open , stare down at its screen : there 's still no signal . she drop it back into the pack . she turn - to examine the clear , she eye fall upon the two backpack from the blue tent . they pocket be zippere open : Jeff and Eric 's hurried pillaging during the downpour have scattered they content across the dirt . stacy rise , step toward this tangle mound . she start to dig through it , casually at first , but then with grow intensity , throw t-shirt and jeans and short aside , probing deeply into the pile . suddenly she go still . stare . amid the sodden mass of clothing sit a knife in a small scabbard . as stacy crouch there , the vine start to rustle , a rippling motion pass across they , as. if a wind be sweeping the hillside . stacy watch with a look of horror : it look like the pelt of some giant animal , shaking itself . when it finally stop , she bend , reach for the knife . int . orange tent - day Jeff , Eric , and Amy , still sleep . the tent 's flap continue to billow in the breeze . very faintly , from the clear , we hear a moan . then the sound of whimpering . Eric open he eye , listen . a instant later , very abruptly , there come a sharp , rending scream of pure pain . Eric jump up , start for the flap ; Jeff be right behind he . 124 . ext . hilltop - the clearing - day Eric emerge from the tent , then Jeff , then Amy . they stand there , stare , too horrify to move . amy oh my God . stacy be on the far side of the clear . she 's pull off she shirt , she short , and have cut much of the skin from she body . she do not notice they . she 's bent over , slice into she leave thigh , peel the skin back from the muscle . eric stacy -- she turn , blood -streak , wild - eye , the knife in she hand ; she skin be hang from she in shred . we can see she leg muscle , she abdominal , a glint of bone at she leave elbow . Jeff start forward , hold out he hand , very stern : jeff give it . now . Eric follow he .

Jeff jump back , cradling he hand at he chest . stacy ( cont would ) I have to -- Eric step toward she , from behind , reach around she body for the knife , and she spin , reflexively , try to fend he off . but the knife be in she hand , and it punch into he chest , just to the right of he sternum , stick there . 125 . Eric look at the knife in surprise . it 's twitching back and forth with the beat of he heart . he start to reach for it , but then he leg give out . he collapse , drop to the dirt , which have grow muddy with stacy 's blood . Amy scream . stacy 's crying deepen ; she take a step toward Eric , but then she own body fail she . she fall to she knee in the bloody puddle , reach toward he . stacy ( cont would ) oh , no ...no ...no ...

Jeff and Amy follow she gaze . a half dozen tendril be snake into the clear , reach toward Eric 's body . Jeff jump to he foot . the tendril begin to wrap themselves around Eric 's limb , and Jeff bend to tear they away . more and more keep come , though .

Jeff turn to see . jeff' Pov - across the clearing the sleep bag in which they would enshroud Mathias be move : he 's thrashing about within it , struggle to sit up . and he 's shout , too , he voice muffled by the bag : mathias' voice henrich ...! henrich ...! he seem to be tear at the bag with he arm . back to scene Jeff hesitates just for a instant , stare in astonishment , then he 's sprinting across the clear . he bend , struggle for the zipper . jeff it 's okay . I be right here .
