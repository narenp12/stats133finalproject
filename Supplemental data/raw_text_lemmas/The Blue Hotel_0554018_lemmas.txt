" blue HOTEL " screenplay by James agee 1949 unproduced title on black screen above center : near the middle of the UNITED states o.s. , quiet , but swiftly louder , the hum , then hammer of rail ; then over this , increase SOUND , the SOUND of a hoarse , old - fashioned train whistle come swiftly nearer : two long blast , one short , one long , which trail down and out . over the fade train whistle and increase train SOUND fade in : title below center : toward the end of the nineteenth century start the rapid SOUND of a train bell . swoop SOUND of bell and train up suddenly two second before cutting to : close shot -- a train ( nite ) instantly bring sound of train and bell up as loud as the audience can stand . a transcontinental express -train cross through r.s. to l.s. at frightening velocity . camera be pull back from a close shot at medium height of the train . in the train 's wake , a long , luminous ruche of snow be raise , fill the screen , and slowly sink , as sound dwindle o.s . as the last snow settles to the ground , and the sound die o.s. , the camera end its pull - back about 12 foot off the ground in a long shot -- ext . a station , a SMALL HOTEL , a SMALL town , the prairie -- in darkness and silence it be not snow and the night sky be overcast but the snow on the ground give off enough light -- use infra-re if need be -- to establish the station ( extreme l.s. ) , the hotel ( dead center ) , the edge of the town ( extreme r.s. ) . even in darkness the hotel give off something odd and curdle . Beyond and between this building , as we eye become accustom to the darkness , we see a immense perspective of snow land , and a very distant low horizon against a black sky which hold two third of the screen . hold this darkness perhaps eight second then , within a maximum thirty second , the darkness alter through the light of pre-dawn , dawn , etc. , to the light of late morning . at the proper early juncture , one or two small light appear in window , and go out again . at the edge of the town , in the earliest real daylight , a man 's tiny figure come out of a door and walk out of ras . Little flag of smoke and steam sprout , compact and crisp , in the bitter air . shade and detail become increasingly clear . the station be coal - black ; its sign fort romper , be just readable . the town be mostly low , mean , frame construction -- the drab shade of tired blotting - paper . the Hotel , of a disturbing shade even in darkness , give off under the change light a always more and more sinister and unearthly fish - belly glare . its sign , palace HOTEL , be newish , and easy to read . it be a crummy rather frail - look wooden building of two storey , crown by florid cornice work . Beyond this building we can see perhaps forty mile . the sky be dull gray ; the snow be like rice ; there be farm , at lonely distance apart . when high , shadowless morning light be establish , the tiny silhouette of a man -- scully -- walk briskly out of the Hotel front door and towards the station . o.s. , begin and bring up sound of a overworked locomotive and a train ; he walk faster ; bring up the sound ; he trot ; a somewhat archaic locomotive , crust and bearded with ice and snow , slow , drag on from l.s. a baggage car , a daycoach , the first of a string of boxcar ; cover scully as he trot ; stop . as quickly as will not be be absurd , scully reappear , walk towards the Hotel , follow by the cowboy , the easterner , the swede , in single file . at the same moment , the camera , which be center on the hotel door , start towards the door at they pace , hold they within leave - screen . we get at first only character by silhouette and near-silhouette , then in more detail . scully be in the lead , half - turn as he walk , to talk ; short , chunky , late middle - age . next , the cowboy , size and structure of John Wayne , tight city trousers , a solid block of mackinaw , he best hat ; he walk like a horseman and with the stooping , rather diffident stride of a man of he height ; he carry a scar raw-hide suitcase or a splotched holstein - hide roll - grip . next , the easterner . he be small , slender , bear himself well and entirely without the bumptiousness of so many small man . without at all mincing , he be more neat - foote along the icy board than the other be ; he carry a briefcase and a middle - size , neutral valise , possibly with fade label on it . last , the swede : he be above average height but stocky enough to seem short than he be , and disturb and scared enough , as a rule , to sag a inch or two more . a shiny black leather coat to the middle of the thigh , trousers which look as if he have on two suit of long underwear beneath they , a cap of coarse hairy wool , two size too small , high on he head , with earflap which at best cannot thoroughly cover he ear . there be something shaky , equivocal and arythmic about he walk . a outsize new suitcase which look to be cover by black oilcloth increase he clumsiness at the knee . as this man grow out of silhouette into detail and size , and we begin to hear they sound , the chowf-chowfings of the locomotive , o.s. , drow out this sound and the locomotive and the train , gather speed , cut off the man from view and then fill most of the screen , the Hotel still jutting above . as locomotive make r.s. , the camera be quite close to train and place - name , emblem and name of line , swinging by , suggest the whole nation and continent in geography and history . CUT or lap : dissolve to : medium two shot -- facade of HOTEL -- door at CENTER the camera be still creep , lowering quietly to eye height . o.s. sound of walk on icy board . the four man enter , in single file and in the same order , at l.s. scully step a pace past he door and wheel and stop abruptly , bow slightly and fling out one hand in a slightly uneasy parody of mine host and cause the other to stop or tread water in uneasy courtesy , indulge he spiel . the camera stop creep at the same moment ; they be medium close . the easterner look quietly and curiously at the strange color . easterner ( politely conceal he faint nausea ) I have never see the shade before , but once . scully ( a little jealous , but very polite ) and where might that be , may I ask ? easterner on the leg of a kind of heron ; one of the wading bird . it 's a very strange color ; there 's nothing else quite like it in nature . it declare the bird 's position against any background . scully declare he -- do it now ! well now , surely that 's a mischievous hue for the almighty to paint a poor craytcher in this murderin ' world . declare I position indeed . aginst inny background . that 's nicely put . that 's it in a nutshell . you kin see the Palace Hotel for mile up the line , all weather , and she 's starin ' like the morning star . now do not ye ? and do ye truly admire it ? easterner it 's a very remarkable shade . scully ahh , count on a travel man for connisewership ! but gintleman , may heaven forgive I a ' I guest rattlin ' they tooth on I own doorstep .

( meantime , he be fill two more basin ) ye do not believe I ? ( to the easterner ) do not be shy ! try it ! you will see . ( the easterner plunge ; the instant the water hit he face he utter four sharp cough , but he stay at it and emerge gasp and grop ; scully produce a towel he grab from a shelf under the tub and now say with a air of great graciousness ) yer towel , sir . scully yer towel , sir . ( same old towel ) dolly along to the swede , eye downcast and shifting a little ; he plant he heavy finger in the water up to they second knuckle , and quickly withdraw they , quailing profoundly . scully ( hand out the towel , now quite draggle , politely but with less enthusiasm ) yer towel , sir . the swede sink one finger at a time into the towel and twist . close up -- the easterner he be look into a mirror . his skin shine as if he have use some kind of metal polish on it ; he be quietly surprised and pleased . he glance down casually to see if he nail be clean . close up -- the cowboy also gaze into the mirror . he have the same burnish look of metal polished . impersonal light eye , a little bit bovine , very virile and empty , fix through most of the shot on he hair , which he be tidy with a public comb . his eye rake down , casually and impersonally across he face at the finish of the shot . close up -- the swede he be twist he finger , one by one , heavily in the towel ; by the angle of he eye and they surreptition , it be clear that he be very carefully watch the other three man in the mirror . at the end of the shot , scully walk into it as the swede drop the towel beside the basin . the swede turn for the door , scully pick up the towel , toss it into a cardboard box , camera swinging as they make for the door . scully ( in be the towel ) thank you . ( call after they ) now just make yerselve comfortable by the stove , gintleman . it will not be no time till dinner . they start through the door . medium close -- the MAIN room past stove on the farmer as he glance up and start to edge back he chair to make room . farmer mean weather . cowboy mean enough . farmer Seven below , last night . cowboy that a fact . farmer warm up a leetle , but it 's jest makin ' fer more snow . cowboy snowin ' a'ready . farmer Big wind acomin ' too , should not wonder . cowboy should not wonder . farmer no sir , should not wonder if we git we a real ole fashion ' blizzard . if ye do not mind my askin ' , stranger , where might ye be from ? cowboy I be down to omahaw ; a little business . farmer a ' where might ye be headin' ? cowboy get I a little ranch , up near the dakota line . farmer that a fact ? stoppin ' over fer the spur train , 's 'at right ? cowboy that 's right . farmer myself , I be a farmer . cowboy that right ? farmer yup . that 's right . start as a homesteader , back in seventy - six , but now I own muh land . cowboy uh huh . farmer Quarter section . cowboy that right ? farmer yup.

( pause . to the swede ) a ' how ' bout you , mister , if ye do not mind I askin ' ? where might you be from ? dissolve to : moving close shot -- alcove of the dine room camera vertical over the dining table , start at the head , pull down along the aisle of place moderately slow . perhaps one or two head ad lib into the shot , ducking over the plate for a bite , but except for this , head be not visible -- only what be on the table , and the busily eat and reach hand . subdued sound of shy , speechless , hungry eat . the food be all on the table and by evidence of damage do , we be well on into the meal . voice be very sporadic and ad lib , possibly recognizable ; close to monosyllabic and wholly utilitarian except for the easterner . ad lib meat please ... pass the potato ... turnip . they be pass , use and return without comment . a hand and fork reach to spear a biscuit . easterner could I have the butter , please . a almost inaudible " sure , " in reply and easterner ( quietly ) thanks . the voice be o.s. , such hand as reach deeper into the terrain than the eat plate , appear at unpredictable angle and rhythm ; perhaps two might also collide and spring apart with the almost electric-shock celerity of shy courtesy . not more than ten second to this vertical pull before we begin to hit barren space , the tundra-like lower reach of the table , all much - mend , not perfectly clean , white tablecloth , no place set . after just a little of this , camera begin to tilt and settle so that as it reach the end of the long table , ( room for a crowded 14 ) it be at eye level of a seat man look up the center of the table at scully at the head . along l.s. , the swede ( next scully ) , and johnnie ; r.s. , the cowboy , ( next to scully ) then the easterner and the Farmer . we pause just long enough to get a glimpse of scully 's character through he eat : a business - like but rather frugal and finicky eater , even a touch of old - maidishness ; a old fashioned and rather cute old guy ; absorb in eat , he lose entirely he mine host mannerism , he 's just a aging pappy at home , reloading . Rather frail eyelid and stretch neck when he drink water ; a evidently self - teach but deeply habitual care to take small bite and to keep he lip close over he chew ; dabby with he fork ; delicate at harpoon a biscuit ; a suggestion of dental plate which do not quite fit . medium close shot -- the swede a big napkin be tie under he ear , its knot - end make spare ear below he own . he be sweat a little . he use he fork left-handed and upside down , european style . he eat steadily with heavy square gesture , and we see in he eat and chew a conflict between the hunger of a fairly heavy eater and he uneasiness . he be intensely silent and he eye be darting all over the joint with a dog 's eat - vigilance plus he own special kind of uneasiness . elbow wide and clumsy , he usually graze johnnie and as camera pull to the leave lose the swede and pick up johnnie , the elbow collide rather hard and the first we see of johnnie 's face involve a spasm of annoyance . medium close shot -- the cowboy from johnnie's angle the cowboy be winking at johnnie , amused . close shot -- johnnie he watch the swede . a small , sour smile , friendly eye , in reaction to the cowboy . his eat be the normal fast heavy eat of a not very well mannered , far from meek , kid , exactly on the watersh between be a boy and a very young man . close up -- the cowboy a napkin tuck fairly high into he dark shirt , he large elbow hold in with unaccustom tightness . his eat system be to mash whatever can be mashed into malleable material , mix it , load he fork by help of he knife as heavy as possible , sculpture and trim it with he knife ; change fork to right hand , bring it up to a mouth which open for it and close over it as efficiently as a steamshovel , then work he full jaw with a fair amount of SOUND which he keep reasonably subdued , meanwhile lowering he fork , change hand , and start all over again . he swallow exactly as soon as the new load be ready and take a swallow of water just before shifting the fork to the right hand : solid machine - like reciprocation between knife , fork , leave hand , right hand , mouth and water glass . otherwise , as a rule , he eye be either attentive to he plate , or out of focus . pull camera to the right , lose the cowboy and pick up the easterner : he be the ordinary eat manners of a well - bring - up middle - class easterner , shade by he own considerable natural elegance . the modestly hearty appetite of a small healthy man . small , strong , fine hand . as with he way of speak , he neither obtrude nor try to conceal or modify what be natural to he or to he background . he be a clear master at see everything there be to be see without appear to stare , or to sneak glance , or even to look , or even to be careful not to look . as the camera leave he , pulling right , he touch he mouth with he napkin , which have be in he lap . tail off briefly on the Farmer , napkin tuck broad over bib of overall , hard , heavy - knuckle red-looking hand : look at nobody ; hoe it in ; a aging , hard work countryman , at home at this table , and unself - conscious of stranger . medium shot -- the whole table from the empty end they be all eat slower , the tail - end of the meal . ad lib and unobtrusively behind this , be scully 's daughter move , wait on table , silently . she be a pale , melancholic , pious , once - pretty spinster of about 30 . by-play and reaction between she and the diner should be present but minimal , and play ad lib in pass , never point up . scully rearrange himself to lean back in he chair and put he hand on the table . a heavy silence as they dab at they food . medium close shot -- the swede his eye angle sharply to the cowboy and then to the easterner . two shot -- the easterner and the cowboy from swede's angle the easterner catch the swede 's eye , look quickly down . the cowboy 's eye up ; down . the easterner look up again with a inevitable tinge of surreptition . medium close shot -- the swede the swede be disturb by the easterner 's look ; glance sharply to the cowboy . two shot -- the easterner and the cowboy from swede's angle the cowboy look up with inevitable surreptition . medium close shot -- the swede the swede be still more worried . give scully a sharp glance . close shot -- scully from the swede's angle he look up at the worried look , quickly down again ; up again , slyly . close shot -- the swede eye sidelong to johnnie , very sly and worried , then to the easterner and the cowboy , intensely suspicious and deeply worried . two shot -- the easterner and the cowboy from the swede's angle the cowboy look up in flat perplexity ; the easterner look up in curiosity so veile it look almost criminal ; then he look down ; then the easterner and the cowboy glance toward each other , each rather secretly , check if the other have notice anything odd ; it look very much like complicity . close shot -- the swede very deeply bother , he rake he glance at each man in turn , then sharply up at the wall above scully . insert : wall above scully from swede's angle a somber steel engrave of " the stag at BAY . " close shot -- the swede the swede 's eye leave the engrave , quick glance all around again ; he be sweat . he look into he plate and at he heavy hand on either side of it . he be work hard to brace himself , he begin to get brave and to resolve himself ; at last he determine to speak . swede ( to scully ) I , I come from New York City . the swede cast quick somber eye at the Farmer . medium close shot -- the farmer from the swede's angle his fork hesitates a fraction near he mouth and go in fast . the Farmer look oven more absorbedly into he plate . scully ( juicily polite ) do ye now ! now be not that intristin ' ! be not that fascinatin ' ! a great city . ah a great city . well I remember I own arrival . swede you come from New York too ? scully no , I only see it fer a matter of day . the daughter pass behind they ; bread pudding to each . scully my home be bahstin mass . every one quietly start to eat dessert . swede I live there ten year . scully tin yearr . ye do not say . tin year . a great city . swede before that I come from Sweden . scully ye do not say .

Rich as cheese . some farm here , the yield be up to thirty - five bushel to the acre .

( to table at large , almost pleadingly ) wealthy ! medium shot -- scully from the swede's angle appall , he glass wobble on he nose . SOUND of swede 's laughter o.s . medium shot -- cowboy , easterner and farmer -- from swede's angle the cowboy 's jaw hang open as if he be dead ; in the easterner , a far more sophisticated astonishment and wonder ; the Farmer scowl more with puzzlement than anger ; all dead silent , hand of all three arrest ; continue swede 's laughter o.s . close shot -- swede's head laugh and gleam and glint at they in great amusement and a glitter of fear . group shot -- full length of table towards scully . everyone motionless and silent except the swede , all head gaw at he : he be rock with laughter and quietly raise he heavy hand a inch from the table and slapping they down again , over and over . slow fade : fade in : close shot -- through the front window of the MAIN room extreme violence of snow and wind , the only visual anchorage be a blanch gate post lean rigid into it . sound of strong wind , shut away , and of snow against the window pane . pull back as scully 's aging hand release a harsh ornate lace curtain he have pull back , and back past scully turn he face in close up from the window , smile , and announce to the room at large : scully a real old - fashioned blizzard , gintleman . ( almost proprietary about it ) full shot -- down the room from scully' angle they be all filing in from the dining room past the stove in the profoundly relaxed few moment of shapeless drift after a satisfy meal . in they whole demeanor and tone of voice there be absolute security ; total lack of personal connection with the blizzard except the pleasure of be indoors . easterner ( forward along l.s. and drift toward the center ) I should say it be .

I can not put up with it any longer . I have stand this crazy swede till I be sick . we will let they fight . he turn out of shot , toward the coat . in he place , medium distance , we see the easterner , he eye on the cowboy , very closely . swing and pull camera so that the cowboy be again in close up r.s. , easterner medium , watch he closely . in the cowboy 's earnest face there be deep - country blood -lust . he turn from the camera toward the easterner and the group and walk through they toward the coatroom , not speak . as he walk and diminish , the other come into view . the easterner hold he eye until he be past . johnnie , hand hook in he belt , be look coolly , studyingly , at the swede . the swede , hand open and heavy at he side , shoulder round , a little farther apart from the group than they be from each other , be look calmly , darkly and a little solemnly , at johnnie ; in a sense he may suggest a chain bear which be about to be bait . it be the easterner who have especially catch the cowboy 's eye and expression . his reaction be that strange , waver , uncontrollable smile with which some people , to they astonishment and shame , react to news of catastrophe . just before the cowboy get out of they range the other two glance toward he . johnnie , with a little smile , look back into the swede 's eye . the swede , look sweaty , ungainly and bashful , look at the floor . the cowboy walk on between they and toward the coat-corridor : johnnie be the first to follow he ; then the swede , with a curious lethargic doggedness , look almost sleepy ; then the easterner , as shakily as if it be he who be go to fight . in the b.g. scully be already hunching into he coat . moving shot camera pull backward through the coat-corridor ( light by lamp ) past scully , who be now buttone up he coat . the only sound be breathe , carefully control , and the sound of clothes and foot . johnnie come up to scully and past he , for he coat ; a silent exchange of glance , the son calm , the father calm and proud : johnnie slip into he coat easily and gracefully . only he and scully be completely calm . the cowboy , with excited hot eye be put on he fur cap with shaky hand . johnnie meet the swede 's eye very coolly , almost humorously , as the swede muscle through for he coat . in this highly charge atmosphere all of the man try they best not to touch each other , but the swede , in ungainliness , do touch johnnie as he pass . a cold little smile from johnnie ; swede tighten he mouth . as we pull back , and the easterner work he way in , the cowboy catch he eye ; the easterner 's glance quickly drop . the swede look at nobody and nobody look at the swede except when they be sure he will not see . the easterner and the swede get to they coat at about the same time . the easterner be very nervous ; he have trouble find the sleeve of he coat but he finally make it . the swede wrap a thick knitted muffler high around he throat . he be very thick - finger buttone he leather coat and , in spite of he effort to subdue it , we hear he begin to breathe heavily . the easterner watch he clumsiness ; he clearly have a sudden impulse to help and he clearly know that he must not . the swede put on he foolishly small cap and try to pull the too-small flap down over he ear ; the cap would obviously not stay on in a fight ; he take it off , look at it for a moment , and hang it back on a hook . that who be already in they coat start drift away from the camera into the main room and out of shot ; the swede and the easterner be alone at this last moment . almost timidly , the easterner look up into the swede 's eye , obviously think hard about something ; perhaps even about to speak . the swede walk past without even seem to see he . the easterner , with the helpless and fatal look of a piece of foam snap over the lip of a waterfall , follow he . long shot -- MAIN room -- front door in deep R.S. the shot be make from the corner opposite the door , inward end of the room , past the stove , include the side table and lamp . scully ( at the door , call the straggler who be already halfway up the room ) well , come on . with they very differ gait , they all hurry up a little . scully open the door . STORM noise . a terrific blast of wind make the lamp struggle at its wick , a puff of black smoke spring from the chimneytop as the man hurry out ; the stove get the cold wind next : its voice swell to equal the roar of the storm and there be the frightening crackle and hammer of hot metal too abruptly chill ; swing camera down as some of the scar and bedabble card be catch up from the floor and dash helplessly against the end wall , ( some , include a face card or two , hang flat against the wall a few inch from the floor ) with SOUND of close door , this card start to fall ; before they reach the floor , quick CUT to : outdoor violence as , with lower head , the man plunge into the tempest as into a sea . medium shot -- past front door -- ext . HOTEL ( nite ) the camera be medium close to the door , waist-high , shoot past the door toward the station , as they stumble out . full SOUND of a very strong wind , but more compelling than any other noise , a pure electric or electronic SOUND , without timbre , either so high it be just at the limit of audibility or so high that it be just beyond that limit and work purely on the nervous system ( experiment will determine which be better use in this context ) . there be no fall of snow ; the wind be so strong it make they stagger and stumble ; they all bow deep and turn they back to the wind as promptly as if they see God ; the wind blow great whirl and cloud of flake , stream southward with the speed of bullet . though we have know from inside that a strong wind be blow , this exceed all expectation : a solid shriek roar like flame , plus the supersonic scream , which be on a high dead level . boom shot a little above head -height , lead they floundering along the hotel façade toward the station , ( leeward side of the hotel ) . as they flounder into a thigh - deep drift we hear the shapeless illegible bawling of the swede , swede ( rough approximation ) I have not get a chance against you bastard . camera dip a little toward they into a fairly close shot as scully wait , put a hand on he shoulder , and project a ear . scully ( shouting : it be just possible to hear he ) what 's that you say ? swede ( bawling ) I say , I will not stand much show against this gang . I know you will all pitch on I . scully ( hit he reproachfully on the arm ; yell ) tut , man ! violent wind . swede ( booming ) you be all a gang of ... wind obliterate the word . they start again , camera pull ahead of they all , face they ; bring in the corner of the hotel and swing swiftly into the lee of the building as the cowboy and johnnie turn in . immediate and strike diminution of noise : but supersonic noise be not diminish . camera with they , face the wall , they walk a few pace in and stand wait , fairly close to the wall , johnnie look toward the corner , the cowboy toward the camera . there be a little light from one first - floor window ( coat corridor ) ; its shade be draw . medium shot -- down past johnnie and cowboy a irregular v-shape of heavily encrust grass amid this great devastation of snow . a long faint rectangle of light from the window . SOUND of crackle of foot on grass o.s. ; both head turn sharply . medium shot -- easterner , scully and the swede they come around the corner . camera at cowboy 's distance from the corner but a few foot farther out from the wall . swede ( still bellow as they come up ) oh I know what kind of a thing this be ! I know you will all pitch on I ! I can not lick you all ! scully ( turn on he ' panther fashion ' . ) you will not have to whip all of we . you will have to whip my son johnnie . a ' the man what trouble you durin ' that time will have I to dale with ! swing camera to center on cowboy , easterner and johnnie . the latter be quiet , noncommittal ; a spasm of contempt on the cowboy 's face ; the easterner 's tooth be chatter , he be stomping he foot and be as jittery with cold as a jump jack . medium close shot -- swede his big head pivote as he look from one to another sullenly , still suspicious . scully take he by the upper arm and lead he cumbrously , camera swinging and pulling back a few foot , away from the wall and into shot with johnnie , who step forward into shot ; scully grab johnnie 's upper arm too . the cowboy come in close behind scully ; the easterner close behind the swede , ( in l.s. ) the easterner alone among the man , be still try to keep himself warm . scully ( in a voice of iron authority ) all right now . fight as ye be : ye will not strip in this weather . bare fist to a finish , no hold , no knee , no kick , no gouging . fight to be end when ayther man call quit or at I own discretion . that satisfactory ? johnnie and the swede glance at scully briefly and at each other briefly . the swede nod . johnnie suit I . they keep on look at each other , the swede very pale and still ; johnnie serene yet ferocious . both be take care not to blink but the swede blink once ; on johnnie 's face , note it , a calm flicker of contempt . scully plant a hand on each chest and set they away from he and apart just out of each other 's reach . scully ( as he set they apart ) now await I signal and abide by I instruction . they raise they fist , johnnie with something of the suppleness of a good modern boxer of he time ; the swede bearish and archaic , slightly suggest early 19th century box print , pump he fist just perceptibly . he stand solid as rock , very heavy and dead on he foot but look hard to knock off they . the cowboy , hand on sprung thigh like a shortstop , face tight , eye brilliant ; the easterner hugging he arm , look sick , glance intently from fighter to fighter . it be while camera center on he or during he close up that the storm seem to get its long mellow cry . closer shot -- swede the cowboy and the easterner be not in the shot unless in the b.g. pretty close on the swede , camera at about shoulder - height : he be pale , motionless , terrible ; swing to scully , the iron-nerved master - of - ceremony ; then to johnnie , serene yet ferocious , brutish yet heroic ; pull away and CENTER on scully with the swede in respect s. and johnnie in las . scully ( after a sharp glance to each of they ) now ! ( no manual gesture ) a note on the fight : this be to be a sensational fight but not in any traditional melodramatic sense of that . it be extremely violent but spasmodic , full of unskillfulness , and very clumsy -- the clumsiness enhance by heavy clothing and by occasional veering onto patch of glare-ice . though the violence be of itself shocking , the chief shock or sensational element be get the shock of two essential amateur , non - fighter , in something close to mortal combat : almost as disconcert as if one see a couple of clergyman try to beat each other ' brain out . this can be arrive at through the ice , heavy clothes , ungainliness and lack of skill . it be also clear that you can kill a man whether you know how or not . both soon learn that in such heavy clothing practically all that 's worth try to hit be the head ; though johnnie , assume that the swede be soft in the middle , try pump they into he belly with hard loud smack of fist against leather . the fight be not shot in detail or from either fighter 's angle , but as the spectator see it -- not very clearly . sound of blow and breathing be way up . insofar as possible , the best fight would come of ad libbing it , barring a few juncture necessary to the story . the two man crash together like bullock and there be a perplexity of fly arm . we so exaggerate the SOUND of the crash that the audience feel it like a kick in the belly ; and instead of any sparring or fool around they instantly start sock with all they speed and strength . both be evidently try for instant and pulverize victory ; also it be very thoroughly a hatred - fight . they work with this intensity as long as they first wind and strength hold . they veer side to side and back and forth enough in this first phase that the camera have to waver back and fill a little , but nothing special -- except that it should not frame they too carefully or neatly . the spectator , move slightly when they need to , get into and out of shot ad lib . as they first crash and sock , a squeeze curse , -- it be indistinguishable from which fighter . ( for ' curse , ' try say the first 2 / 3rd of " God " and " Christ " simultaneously , from between tight tooth ) . close shot -- the easterner his pent - up breath explode with a pop of relief from the tension of the preliminary . cowboy ( o.s. , a sort of Texas yowl ) close shot -- the cowboy in mid-yowl and in mid-air ; he land on he foot again and , hand on knee , look intently . close shot -- scully immovable as from supreme amazement and fear at the fury of the fight which he himself have permit and arrange . sound of fight be strong o.s. over all this shot . close shot -- swede and johnnie and as suggest above ; till they draw away to get they wind ; and they now come at it more cautiously . after some sparring and some wild miss , the swede become impatient and try to be a bulldozer ; by he sudden drive toward the camera , the fighter all but knock it over , and the camera have to " step " quickly aside , mindful for a moment only of its foot , as the fighter pass in a blur . medium shot -- reverse angle the fighter be past the camera which now , reverse on former position , shoot away from the hotel wall ; the three spectator come slowly into the shot , flanking and back - to . the drive continue though johnnie be now give near as good as he get ; but retreate a little and wheeling . wheeling , they almost simultaneously hit glare-ice . johnnie , surer -foote , keep he foot , the swede fall heavily backward , to some extent save himself with one hand . scully come up to they fast , the camera nearly as fast ; he needlessly stay johnnie with one hand for johnnie be stand a little too close over the swede . johnnie ( with what breath he have , but not jump he ) get up . get up and fight . get up . scully have lift he other hand as if for a count but the swede grunt : swede I be not out . johnnie do not lay there all night then you yellow ... scully shut up johnnie it be no true fall . the man 's get a right to ... but already the swede lumber to he foot , duke ready . scully ( stay the swede ) git back off the ice both o' yez . he lead they in toward the hotel , the camera pulling back with they , and step back to the edge of shot , skid a little himself . a second 's hesitation , the swede seem a little slow and stunne , then johnnie drive in on he with terrible intensity , the swede cover up clumsily , johnnie work mainly on the head . close quick shot -- the cowboy look much more excited than before . johnnie be deliver hard , fast blow against the swede 's hand which be try to guard he head , and be then hammer clublike wrist on the bow nape of the swede 's neck . cowboy ( yell and spring forward into the shot ) go it johnnie ! go it ! kill he ! kill he ! scully come into shot quickly . close shot -- scully and cowboy scully ( barring he ) kape back . by he glance the cowboy can see that this man be johnnie 's father . scully 's manner in this must be something to respect . medium shot -- the fighter johnnie be still hammer but have grow wholly careless of he guard . suddenly the swede uncork a sonofabitch to the belly which double johnnie , and miss a lulu to the head as johnnie duck and back off , get he guard up ; then the swede land a wild one to the head which johnnie sufficiently cover and glance off that they be now again somewhere near even . the swede rush it , take as much as he give , which be plenty . close quick shot -- the easterner -- watching medium shot -- past the easterner a monotony of unchangeable fight which be a abomination . both horribly skid but stay on they foot . as soon he have he balance , the swede close and pour it on ; johnnie regains equality ; they lurch so near the easterner that he have to scramble hastily backward and we hear they breathe like man on the rack . close shot -- the easterner his sicken face , wishing it would end , no matter how . cowboy's voice ( o.s. , bellow ) kill he johnnie ! kill he ! kill he ! close shot -- the cowboy by the middle of the forego line . his face be contort like one of that agony mask in museum . close up -- scully scully ( icily , to cowboy ) keep still . the cowboy lean into the shot , puzzle and offended , look at scully and scully at he . SOUND o.s. , of a sudden loud grunt , incomplete , cut short ; they eye toward the fight . medium shot -- from angle of scully and cowboy johnnie 's body swing away from the swede and fall with sicken heaviness . the swede , with a kind of wild animal snarl , ( roughly , arghrgh ) be obviously about to swing himself headlong on johnnie . upward shot -- across johnnie SOUND o.s. , of run as the swede hover . the cowboy run into medium closeup and interpose a arm . cowboy ( to the swede ) no you do not ! wait a second ! scully hurry into the shot , nearer we , stand but lean over he son like a mother to a crib . scully ( tenderly ) johnnie ! johnnie , I boy ! johnnie ! can you go on with it ? ( he be look anxiously down ) bring camera down into a close shot , almost upside down from we angle , of johnnie 's bloody , pulpy face . scully squat and he head return into the shot , close above johnnie 's . a moment of silence . johnnie ( in he ordinary voice ) yes , I ... it ... yes . scully 's arm under he nape and then he shoulder , tenderly , nearest to we ; clumsy , humiliate and piteous get - up and help - up , mostly back - to the camera . camera lifting to level of the stand man , bring in the cowboy and the swede in b.g. , cowboy ( still rumbling ) you wait a second . the easterner step into the shot at r.s. , a hesitant hand toward scully 's sleeve . as johnnie get fully to he foot , the camera pull around he leave shoulder ; scully still have a arm across he back ; the easterner come closer into the shot on the far side of scully . but the moment he get he foot , johnnie move to throw off he father 's arm and veer toward the swede , fist readying , but obviously weak . scully wait a bit now till you get you wind . cowboy's voice ( o.s . ) you wait a second . easterner ( a hesitant hand at scully 's sleeve , a low sick voice , plead ) oh , this be enough ! this be enough ! let it go as it stand . this be enough ! during this speech , the camera have pulled around so that scully be in full face close up , the easterner a pinch profile at the side . scully act exactly as if he have not hear except that he face get hard as iron . we hear the SOUND of johnnie 's wavy breathe but he face be not in the shot . scully ( coldly ) Bill . medium close shot -- cowboy -- from scully' angle -- swede behind he the cowboy say nothing ; a enquire look . medium close shot -- scully at CENTER , easterner and johnnie scully ( still more iron in he voice ) git out o' the road .

Ice and snow be on he face like a break mask . scully be you any good yet , johnnie ? nothing from johnnie . with he free right hand , tenderly as a woman , scully smooth back the clotted hair from the smear , smooth , very young - look forehead , and wipe away the ice and snow . johnnie gasp and open he eye languidly . johnnie ( after a moment ) no ...

( the merchant be deeply move by admiration for all this ) ... even we regret it most painfully , perhaps most painfully of all if I may say so . after all , every responsible person in Fort romper , every self - respect man in this part of the State , know you as a square gambler . you have never yet be know to take advantage of any man who do not , in every sensible person 's ... uh ... in the opinion of every sensible person , richly deserve it , one might say " ask for it " . you family life be exemplary . you companionship be a pleasure which all of we hope to share for many year to come ( even more earnestly and gently ) but we do hope you understand , sir. after all , ( he voice all but crack with earnestness ) the pollywog Club be a pleasure club . oh , stake , perhaps modest stake , but among amateur as it be ; ( a feeble would - be - charming smile ) greenhorn . of course there be not a single member of we little club who could imagine that you would ever ... ever , well , as it be , uh , well , violate , uh , take advantage of ... ( by now he be thoroughly miserable ) ... I do hope you understand I , sir. ( the invisible man just let he fry ) but a professional gambler , after all . it 's just the principle of the thing you know . the ap ... the appearance of the thing . no personal offense in the world .

I be deeply grateful for that candor . allow I to meet you with equal candor . I think I need say only this : if I be a member of the pollywog Club , and my own name or that of any other professional gambler be bring to a vote , I would have act precisely as you have do , for precisely the same reason , and with precisely the same sentiment , before , during , and after . in a word , I would have blackball myself from the pollywog without a second think . during this speech the Doctor and the merchant have turn they eye slowly to he in wonder and almost in unbelief , and the lawyer 's eye have stay on he , burn with a steadily increase light of deep emotion . by the end of it they be all look at he practically as if he be Jesus and could cook into the bargain . the lawyer 's eye be brim ; he clear he throat but he can not speak yet ; the merchant look at he and now he eye brim too . at last the lawyer rise ( the other hurriedly follow suit ) with he glass . lawyer ( all choke up ; very quietly ) let we stand , my friend , and drink : to a gentleman ! medium close shot -- the gambler as he rise quickly ; he be elegant , histrionic ; quietly dignify , cold as ice . gambler ( with a slight bow ) to you : gentleman : and my good friend . they all touch glass and drink with they respective idea of 18th century elegance . the merchant , overwhelm with emotion , clearly have the sudden idea of smash he glass and make the start of a gesture toward that end . barkeeper' voice ( o.s. , gently but alarmed ) hey -- hey ! the merchant shrivel up with humiliation like a spider in a flame ; the gambler 's amused delight be beautifully conceal . he do not look around at the barkeeper , but modestly at the table . both other glance sharply at the barkeeper . medium shot -- barkeeper from they angle , about halfway up the bar . his forehead be still wrinkle with dismay ; he be awfully embarrassed to have speak so sharp to such respectable folk . barkeeper ( in a low voice ) ' scuse I , folk , it just slip out . close group shot between the lawyer and the Doctor , on the merchant and the gambler . the lawyer , by he slight stiff turn of head away from the barkeeper , do not even deign to grant he pardon . the gambler be very quiet ; a almost tenderly sympathetic smile behind which he be reveling in a cruel delight of ironic amusement . the Doctor 's head rugge and quiet , a little more scraggy look than before . the merchant , crumpled with embarrassment , be just carefully set down he glass . the lawyer save the situation virtually unimpaire by bow slightly and formally to the gambler , who return it to the table at large ; the Doctor bow , and the merchant , a trifle late ; as they sit down , the lawyer gently , manfully clap the merchant on the shoulder ; a glance from the merchant of spaniel - like gratitude . they noble mood be addle but not utterly destroy : they seek to repair it . by the gambler 's smile we know exactly the smile , from the lawyer , which elicite it ; the merchant be try to smile too when there be the o.s. SOUND of the front door open and a stamp in the vestibule between the street door and the swinging door : all glance toward the door except the gambler , who watch the lawyer . long shot -- the front door top rim of the bar in ras . the rim of the bar be exactly level in perspective and sprout from exact center of the right edge of the screen . a almost instantaneous shot as the swede start come through the swinging door . close shot -- swede at head height , as he come through . he be as high and glow as before , though slightly less wild ; the sudden warmth hit he like a shock of peace and good prospect ; he face soften and swell ; he eye flick the joint . again a very brief shot ; he be step forward . long shot -- the table face and eye just at the end of casually look at he ; resume they private conversation . this shot be as quick as a glance . medium close shot -- barkeeper at he station near mid-bar . eye quick from the table to the swede , a quick size - up ; underplay and , again , as quick as a glance . close shot -- down on the swede's valise and right foot he plant he right shoe on the rail ; it be clogge with snow ; he stomp and scrape rather loudly , try to clear it . medium long shot -- the table Quick , gentlemanly glance of annoyed wonder what it be , find out , gentlemanly ignore of the boorishness ; back to they mutton . close shot -- barkeeper a sharp little glance toward the table and toward the noise ; annoyance ; a tinge of refinement . close down shot -- valise and foot the swede get he foot hang comfortably . close shot -- the swede he settles he elbow at the bar . he be tired , almost sleepy with the sudden warmth ; glow like a stove ; still on top of the world but become very peaceful . swede ( eye to barkeeper ) gimme some whiskey , will you ? the barkeeper walk quietly into the shot with a high - grade bartender 's faintly insolent politeness toward a low - grade customer ; he plant a bottle on the bar , a whiskey glass , and a glass of ice-thick water . the swede pour himself a abnormal portion and drink it down in three gulp . while the swede pour and gulp , the barkeeper , past he , pretty close in the shot , be make the pretension of blindness which be the distinction of he class , but it can be see that he be furtively study the halfraise bloodstain on the swede 's face . barkeeper ( indifferently ) pretty bad night . no answer . barkeeper bad night . ( he meaning be clearly double and quietly discourteous : bad night for you , bud , that 's clear enough ) swede ( pour more whiskey ) oh , it 's good enough for I . he root under he coat and deep into he britches - pocket , slap down a coin , and toss off the new drink , eye follow the barkeeper . medium shot -- barkeeper -- from swede's angle put the coin through a highly - nickel cash register with a brilliant clanging of the bell . closer shot -- swede as he finish he second drink ; he be heavier now yet still tremendously elate and at peace with himself : he pivot eye and head in a slow benign sweep down the bar and in the direction of the table , look toward the man , o. s. , with tower benign vanity and self - confidence , and friendly interest . SOUND o.s. , of a coin slap on the bar , rouse he from this boozy muse . camera " adjust " about as heavily and clumsily as the swede do , to get the barkeeper into the shot . swede ( a wave of the hand ) keep it , keep it . barkeeper ( with a tinge of sarcasm ; the change be only a nickel ) thank you sir . swede ( grandly ; abstractedly ) buy yourself a cigar . a pause . the barkeeper be look toward the table ; the swede at the barkeeper . the swede be try to cogitate . he 's somewhat disappointed ; nothing be go as he have wildly imagine it would go with people , from now on ; but he have just enough sense to realize : after all , this guy do not know I for what I be . better let he in on it a little . swede no , this be not too bad weather . it 's good enough for I . barkeeper ( languidly ) so ?

" over brass disc of music of suppertime , very faint , scully , easterner , cowboy rush to congratulate he by he tree just after the fight . over same music , indoors by the stove , johnnie , batter and sheepish , nod and grin as he lift the swede 's hand as the victor 's . over same music , a little louder , swede in close up , he arm around johnnie 's shoulder , both face beat up , both grin as scully , grin , in l.s. , offer the yellow - brown whiskey bottle . over the SOUND of transcontinental express , a unknown good look well - breed blonde woman of a ripe thirty - five lose a look of hauteur and smile up at he promisingly . over train and disc music a whole parlorfull of flozzy in negligee hasten , happily , to swarm around a advance camera . a fearsome heavily - mustach blond man in clothes of lower middle - class Sweden ( circa 1860 , -- he father ) , glaring down into the lens over the SOUND of whipping and child 's cry , suddenly smile beautifully and benignly : total approval and respect as eye and lens lift and come level : no whipping SOUND : then scowl again . the immense vague tender face of a young woman , shot from the angle and nearness of a baby look up from the crook of she elbow ; over the SOUND of a warm untrained contralto half - hum a lullaby or folksong in a foreign language , she gaze with infinite tenderness and pity into the lens . SOUND of impact of a tremendous blow , explode 398- h into a white flash and recover into a close image of johnnie past he still landing fist . easterner , from earlier , he mouth say , " I do not understand you " : but silent . from the swede 's viewpoint : johnnie do something shady with the card . a long line of hard man in a dark bar look up rather dangerously at the advance camera over the SOUND of swinging door . close detail - shot of " the stag at Bay , " very dark .

SOUND of the Doctor 's footstep ; the gambler 's eye move steadily with he : he come across close , l.s. to r.s. ; the gambler 's eye on he . the Doctor do not look at he ; he be so scrawny and rugge with shock and distress he look sick and ten year older . he cross the shot and out . the gambler 's eye very quietly to l.s. again : 3 flick of he eye , to height of the lawyer , the merchant and then the lawyer again , swinging with they . they enter and cross the shot , side by side ; the merchant on the far side of the lawyer and almost totally obscure by he . merchant ( half -moan ) o my gaaahhhdd - uh , my gaaahhdd - uh . he say this about every five second from the time he start to he exit , ever more moistly , softly , calflike , never louder . the lawyer 's head , close , high in screen , be desperate icy granite , noble Roman ; he eye , which look straight forward , unsee as a statue 's . the gambler 's eye follow as they exit right screen . long shot -- the front door the rim of the bar in the middle of the edge of r.s. , and level in perspective . the lawyer very erect , a arm across the merchant 's shoulder ; the merchant cave in and stumbling as a widow . now they either just avoid stumbling , or stumble brutally against , the swede 's valise ; then on , not look back , and out the door . medium shot -- the gambler SOUND of close door . very slowly he lift he knife and look at it . again by terrific effort he bring the tremble of the blade down to just perceptible . after a long pause he lift he eye toward the barkeeper , o.s . gambler ( very quietly ) May I have you bar-cloth , please . medium shot -- barkeeper barkeeper ( limply ; almost inaudibly ) yes , sir . he walk unsteadily up the bar for the cloth , toward the edge of the shot , while the gambler walk even more slowly to the bar ; he back , like he front , expressive of terrific shock and incredible control . medium close shot -- gambler and barkeeper as they converge at the bar , barkeeper extend the cloth delicately and the gambler take it as delicately . gambler nod thank you . the gambler wipe he blade and as he do that he hand and knee start tremble badly in spite of himself . with a almost suicidal effort he control the tremble and make the faintest beginning of hand the cloth back to the barkeeper , who wince very faintly ; then , reach carefully rather than toss , he put the cloth on the bar . he fold he knife and put it in he pocket . gambler ( in a unearthly calm , dry voice with a scratchiness underneath ) Charlie , you tell them where to find I . I will be home , wait for them . the barkeeper try to speak ; he can not ; he nod , then nod again . the gambler walk into the shot and past the camera and return , within a couple of second , walk into the shot and away , back - to ; he hat be already on ; as we first see he he be finish shrugging into and settling he overcoat ; and now , by faint motion of hand and elbow , as he continue , we know he be buttone it . it must be clear that though he walk very erect , calm , and even , he be scarcely able to stand up . he take a long slant line to avoid the valise ; rectify the line the instant he pass it ; and so out the door . ( under all this exit use SOUND of foot on sand floor ) . the barkeeper , who lean back against the bar as the gambler go for he coat , stay there very still a moment after the door shut ; then up the bar , knee wobbly , a hand on the bar sustain he now and then , to the bottle on the bar at the swede 's place . he lift the bottle and the swede 's glass , put down the glass and drink from the bottle , deeply . the inevitable violent reaction of a kind of writhe of he whole interior ; a kind of gobble SOUND . then a great huh expulsion of breath : then loud deep breathe , stunne eye wander vacantly . then we see that they must light on the swede , o.s. , for they stop abruptly , and so do the breathe . then after a couple of second the breathe begin again , great huh , but this time much more terrible shatter with shock and with a kind of dry sobbing : a off - balance pump : huh -- uhhhhh : dead silence : huh -- uhhhhh : dead silence . he take two almost sneaky step toward the door ; hand reach behind and untying he apron : then sprint ungainly , he apron foul leg and foot and kick aside as if it be a snake , with another awful huh -- uuuhhh carry he at high speed through the door . no SOUND of close door , but SOUND of the scream of the storm , very far down . barkeeper' voice ( o.s. ; retreate in the street and muffle in the storm , bawling , bestial ) helllllp ! murrrrrder ! helllllp ! hold shot on bare bar and perspective of its rim , through this line . full shot -- the whole interior ( orthochromatic film ) a formal shot from the dead center of the front of the room : a shot model on postcard of 1890 - 1910 : we first full view of the nicest bar in a small town : pathetic but not completely unsuccessful in its effort at a kind of barren charm and grace . the sand on the floor in the f.g. be sweep in pretty curclicue ; this be scuff along the bar and where the fight take place . hold three or four second , long enough to register fully the swede and the cash register , dead - opposite each other , at exact middle of they side of the room . no storm SOUND : pure silence . extreme close up -- the swede's left eye ( orthochromatic ) occupy the whole screen except enough to show a little of a contuse cheekbone and across it , a crooked rill of dry blood and a snailtrack shine of a not yet dry tear . the eye , if technically possible , be glaze as we watch . silence . extreme close shot -- the cash register ( orthochromatic ) the ornate cast- iron top of the nickel - plate cash register . its florid shape recall the florid cornice of the Blue Hotel . the cash amount be below -screen . the stamp lettering of the legend be fiercely cold , glitter , massive and hard -- a little ornate like much of the lettering of the time : this register the amount of you purchase o.s. SOUND of a door open . hold the shot a couple of second after it . fade out : fade in : medium close shot -- the easterner as he come through the swinging door , advance a couple of pace , and stop dead in he track as he eye find the swede . a impulse to go to he be instantly arrest ; it be so clear that he be beyond help . almost unconsciously , he set down he travel bag . a freezing anguish of guilt enter he still face . after a sufficient pause to make clear they do not come with he , scully , johnnie and the cowboy come in , quietly , but wind . they also look , see , and be silent . they try to subdue they breathe . they have leave the street door open and we can see that there be no more storm or SOUND outside . the easterner be aware when they come in ; we feel that he even know who they be . but throughout the scene , he never shift he eye from the swede ; and they shift theirs only rarely . throughout , they stand behind easterner . after a considerable silence : scully ( in a subdued voice ) how do it happen ? the easterner say nothing . a pause . cowboy ( quietly too ) you ask I , that feller be lookin ' for trouble . a ' he sure find himself a plenty . a pause . easterner ( in a strange , vague voice ) look ...? ( more firmly , but very quiet ) like all troubled men. ( pause ) and we help he find it , and we trap he into it . a pause . the three man behind now glance at each other . scully ( a little less subdued ) see here , mister . the easterner say nothing . scully just one thing . easterner ( quietly ) go home . scully just one little thing . johnnie a ' I live in this town . we do not want no storey shpread around that ye ... easterner ( as quietly ) go home . stop worry . tell whatever story you please . scully ye mane ye -- ye will not ... easterner you conscience be you business . each one of you . my own be enough for I to cope with . they linger , unsure and weary . easterner ( with deep exhaust bitterness ) so just go home now . leave I alone . ( pause ) if you please ! a silence . scully ( quietly and solemnly ) we do not have no part in it . the three shake they head , but they do not look at each other . easterner every sin be a collaboration . everybody be responsible for everything . the three look unsurely at each other ; they be obscurely abash . scully ( with a slight gesture and a almost inaudible whisper ) come on . each look a last time toward the swede , each in he own strange way , kind of gloomy , shy , forebode reproach and resentment ; and each , one by one , turn away from the camera and walk quietly outdoors and out of the shot . we hear only the SOUND of the faint squeaking of they shoe on snow , and soon this die . with the absolute silence a even more fierce and live quiet intensify in the easterner 's face and become , as well , sorrow , pity , tenderness , a passionate desire for , and hopelessness of , expiation . the face rise on a high wave of realization , almost transfigure , on the verge , even , of mysticism , yet iron , virile , tragic -- as , very slowly , he eye still fix toward the swede , he walk into extreme close up and past the camera out of the shot . the camera hold for a few second on the swinging door , whose subtle breathe stop . Beyond they , through the open door , the air be utterly still . long shot -- the blue HOTEL -- same as that which opened the picture Three tiny figure walk in single file down the home stretch . in the immense silence we can just hear they foot . they go in . Light gape and vanish , as the door open and close . after a few second , light appear in the upstairs window . after a few more second , the downstairs light go out . then one upstairs light . then the other . the sky be emblazon with a freezing virulence of pattern star . almost inaudibly , deep in the distance , o.s. SOUND of a train whistle . in the silence after it , the cold star sharpen ; and very slowly , like a prodigious wheel , the whole sky begin to turn . fade out : the end
