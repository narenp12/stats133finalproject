" erik the viking " screenplay by Terry Jones blackness flame begin to lick upwards from the bottom of the screen . suddenly all hell break loose . scream , yell . Black figure flash across the foreground , with the flame still burn behind . there follow a confusion of burn , raping , kill and looting -- we do not clearly see what 's go on . suddenly we cut to the interior of a hut . the door be in the process of be break down . the camera pan onto the close - up face of a attractive girl who be stare in horrify fascination at the door . her arm be white with fresh dough and flour . suddenly the door burst open and a wild - look Viking leap into the hut . he hold a sword . he look around wildly and then he eye come to rest on the girl . this Viking , I be afraid , be Erik . we be about to see he in the worst possible light so be prepare . the girl , whose name be helga , cower , and look terrify but resolute . Erik glance round . then slowly he advance on the girl , force she back onto a chest . Erik hold he sword to helga 's throat with he right hand , while he leave hand search to find the thongs hold up he trousers . he be clearly have difficulty try to hold he heavy sword to helga 's throat at he same time as undoing he trousers . he fumble and lower he sword for a moment . helga have you do this sort of thing before ? erik I ? of course ! I have be looting and pillaging up and down the coast . helga ( look skeptical ) loot and pillaging , eh ? erik ( on the defensive ) yes . helga what about the raping ? erik shut up . helga it 's obvious you have not rape anyone in you life . erik sh ! he cover she mouth with he free hand , and look round to make sure no one 's hear . then he carry on try to undo he trousers , but he be now somewhat more than half - heart about it . helga watch suspiciously . helga do you like woman ? Erik be clearly shocked and stung by the insinuation . he stop . erik of course I like woman ... I love them . helga ( point out the obvious ) you do not love I . erik no ... right ... this be rape ... Mark you , I be not say I could not get to like you ... in fact ... well , to be quite honest , I prefer it when there 's some sort of mutual feel between two people ... helga what -- rape ? erik no . it be not rape then , be it ? helga oh , get it over with . erik ( hesitates again ) I do not suppose ... no ... helga what ? erik I do not suppose you ... you do like I at all ? helga what d' you expect ? you come in here , burn my village , kill my family and try to rape I ... this be too much for Erik . we wither under the irony . erik I will kill you if you say anything about this to anyone . helga ( puzzle ) about raping I ? erik about not raping you ... helga you don 't like it , do you ? erik well it just seem a little bit crude , that 's all . helga what about the kill and looting ? that 's just as crude , be not it ? erik oh well -- you have got to do they . helga why ? why have you get to go round kill and looting ? erik to pay for the next expedition , of course . helga but that 's a circular argument ! if the only reason for go on a expedition be the kill and looting and the only reason for the kill and looting be to pay for the next expedition , they cancel each other out . erik oh ! stop talk as if we be marry ! helga well you start it . erik I just say I do not feel like raping you . helga and I be just say that rape be no more pointless or crude than all the kill and looting that go on . Erik vent of he frustration on the already shattered door . erik scream . helga ah. erik louder . helga aaagh ! rape ! erik ( he would forget about that ) oh , thanks . two more Viking burst in with eye blaze . they have the very unfortunate name of Ernest and Jennifer , but it do not really matter , for reason which will become obvious very quickly . they be also slightly drunk . ernest rape ? jennifer where ? Jennifer the Viking sway and lean against a door post . the marauder 's eye come to rest on Erik and helga who be stand , fully clothed , about six foot apart . they look slightly puzzle . helga he rape I stand up . there be a pause . Erik look up at helga . why have she save he face by tell this lie ? Jennifer the Viking turn to Erik . jennifer you finish , then ? erik oh ... yes ... I suppose so ... ernest right ! I first ! jennifer no ! I ask ! Ernest leap on top of helga and pin she to the ground . Jennifer join in . Erik look stunne for a moment . then he suddenly leap to helga 's defense . erik leave she alone ! he pull Jennifer off , but Jennifer fight back . Erik force Jennifer back until he fall into the knead trough . they fight in the dough for some moment , until Erik run Jennifer through . the dough be stain red , and the film be rid of such a inappropriately name Viking once and for all . Erik then turn he attention on Ernest who be still on top of helga . without a moment 's hesitation , Erik run he through the back . Ernest scream . so do helga . Erik turn white , and pull out he sword . Ernest fall over into a heap with he co-misnomer , and Erik kneel beside helga to find a bloodstain under she breast where he have inadvertently run she through . she be clearly not long for this world . helga thanks for save I from a fate worse than death . erik I do not mean to ! helga ( gasp for breath ) oh , that 's all right then ... it 's the think ... that count ... Erik cradle she head and try helplessly to staunch the blood . erik you tell they I rape you -- why ? helga ( die ) I dunno ... you look so ... so vulnerable ... erik why should you care ? helga ( die ) why ... should you care ? erik tell I you name ? helga look up at he , but die in he arm , without ever say she name . erik tell I ... what be it ...? Erik realize she have go . he gaze at she for some time . he look around at the two dead body beside they . then he listen to the sound of raping and slaughter continue on the outside . scream and bloodthirsty shut echo alongside the roar of flame and the cry of animal . the camera track into a big close - up on Erik . superimpose the title : " erik the viking " second title : " tim robbins " mix through to wide shot of the burn village . figure run here and there . superimpose the rest of the open title . by the last of the open title the last of the flame be die down . cut to a close - up of a very loud-looking Viking scream into the camera , as he hurl a axe . this Viking 's name be thorfinn Skull - splitter . the axe thud into the wall a few inch away from the face of a frighten girl , unn , who be pin to the wall with she braid spread out . the Viking be hurl axe at she a la kirk Douglas in " the Viking " . several Viking sit at ale - bench , laugh in a rather unpleasant way . Erik , however , frown . he be sit at a table on a dais , next to he grandfather , the chief of the village . his grandfather almost choke with merriment . Erik 's mother glance at he with some hostility . meanwhile the drunken thorfinn have just lift the totally legless ivar the boneless up off the floor and press a axe into he hand . a tremor of nervousness ripple round the female in the mead Hall . ivar be clearly in no condition to throw anything , except , perhaps , the content of he stomach . unn wince . finally , amidst much giggle , ivar throw wildly , and the axe smashes into a jug be carry by one of the serve girl . the menfolk erupt into drunken hysterics at this . the woman clearly feel that the occasion be get out of hand . but before any of they can work up enough courage to intervene , thorfinn Skull - splitter have thrust a axe into the hand of the even more plaster sven the berserk . now sven be not the Viking to let a little matter like not be able to see straight stop he heaving the axe at a young maiden . he take the axe and whirl it wildly over he head . even the other drunken Viking realize this could be dangerous , and they cower behind the table . sven let go of the axe . unn shut she eye prepare for the worst . there be a dull thud and a grunt and then a whoop of mirth . unn open she eye to find that the axe have come to rest in the back of a totally stupefy Viking who merely slump forward onto the table he be sit at . on the opposite side sit harald missionary , a rather seedy cleric who have long since give up try to convert the pagan and find solace in they mead . he think about intervene , but decide that it 's a bit late really and that he might as well finish off he ale - cup instead . grimhild housewife ( he only admirer ) refill it for he . at this moment , however , the axe -thrower have run out of axe , so , as they go to retrieve the one they have throw , harald missionary salve he conscience by lurching across to the unfortunate unn . he poke he dog -ear bible under she nose . harald if you be think of convert , my dear , this would be a ... ideal opportunity ... unn not now ! harald ( who be use to rebuff ) no , of course not ... ( he hesitates ) you might not get another chance , you know ... unn go away . at this moment another axe thud into the wall , speed up harald 's desire to get back to the ale-bench . harald yes , of course ... I will pray for you anyway , my dear ... suddenly a axe shatter a large earthware vessel . harald yes .. that 's what I will do ... harald scuttle back to the ale - bench as fast as he can . Erik meanwhile , stare in astonishment as , for a fleeting moment , he see helga , the girl he accidentally kill , stand there with she braid spread out in place of unn . he shake he head and the vision pass . in the meantime , however , ivar 's mum ( perhaps the toughest lady in the village ) have decide that enough be enough . ivar' mum let she go ! thorfinn why ? viking yes , why ? sven the berserk why should we let she go ? thorfinn we have not hit a single braid yet ! the Viking all guffaw . ivar 's mum have have enough . she throw the content of a jug of ale over thorfinn . he be shocked , but after the first shock he grin evilly , because now he 's be give carte blanche to do the thing he enjoy do most . without another think he throw a vicious right hook at ivar 's mum and lay she out cold . Erik react with disgust . his granddad , however , give a whoop of glee . grandad whoah ! heee ! that show she ! meanwhile a little shrivel old man be jump up and down . ingemund the old hey ! he hit my wife ! ingemund start to go for thorfinn , but thorhild beat he to it . she grab one of the long -handle cooking griddle from the fire and swing it at thorfinn . thorfinn , however , duck , and the red-hot griddle hit sven the berserk , who be stand with he back to thorfinn . sven scream and go berserk , turn round and hit thorfinn who be now stand upright again . ingemund the old leave he alone . ingemund hit sven . thangbrand hit ingemund and a general fight break out . Erik 's granddad clearly consider this the highlight of the evening , but Erik look at it in disgust and at he granddad in despair . eventually he get up and walk out of the mead Hall . his granddad notice and frown . he know something 's wrong with he grandson but have not a clue what it could be . Erik 's mother frown and nod to he granddad . grandad get up and fight he way through the melee to follow Erik out of the Hall . the snow lie thick over the village as Erik 's grandfather join he grandson beside the little quay . Erik be stare broodily into the night . grandfather what 's the matter , son ? Erik do not reply . his grandfather glance back at the mead Hall , whence the sound of the fight drift across the snow . grandfather we be miss all the fun ... erik what 's it all about ? grandfather what ? erik we toil and labor , we loot and pillage , rape and kill ... and yet ... grandfather you talk piffle , son ? erik where do it all get we , grandpa ? grandfather who have you be talk to ? erik I meet this girl ... grandfather it 's always the woman that start the trouble . erik she get I think ... grandfather so ? what would you do to she ?

Erik take the rope and begin pay it out . with grim face the Viking turn and face towards the roaring of the water , as Erik edge the ship further into the mist . the noise be deafen . it would be almost impossible to hear any voice above it . the face of the Viking betray they fear as they find themselves emerge from out of the mist at the Edge of the World . they gape as they find themselves confront by a waterfall of Seas -- stretch on either side of they -- as far as the eye can see -- water fall and plunging over the lip of the world . and in front of they -- the blue sky continue on down and down until it shade into blackness strewn with star beneath they foot ... sven , sven 's dad and keitel edge to the prow and gasp . aud no ! do not look over the Edge ! Erik let out a little more rope , until the ship be protrude over the edge . sven , he dad and keitel peer over the side , and stare down into the abyss . they gasp . from above we see the prow of Golden Dragon and the back of the Viking ' head in plain view against a backdrop of star below they . erik let I see ! aud hold he back . aud no. do not look ... the abyss will suck away you strength . erik I must look ! keitel ! hold this ! Erik turn to see sven and keitel tremble ... they hold onto the side of the ship but they leg can barely support they . sven there be nothing we can do ... sven' dad helpless ... keitel start to laugh . keitel ha ha ... I believe loki ... I believe I have a duty to blacksmith ! ha ha ha ! keitel laugh a little hysterically . aud turn urgently to Erik . aud you still want to go to asgaard ? erik of course . aud do you believe I love you ? erik I ... but I ... aud you do not have to love I . just : do you believe I love you ? erik yes -- I believe you do . aud then let go ! Erik hesitates , then he decide to believe in aud . he throw the rope away . at once the ship shoot off over the Edge of the World into space ... everything seem to slow down , as the longship drop down and down ... the ship twist slowly as it drop .... round and round . the Viking gaze about they in wonder , as they find they ship if fall in silence amongst the star . harald come to once again . harald I be still see star . keitel look round at he . keitel we be all see star . harald no ! I be hit on the head . the longship fall and fall through the star-strew space until it softly land in a white wilderness . on the deck the Viking be huddle up , cover with rime - frost . it seem as if they have be lie there half - freeze for some time . perhaps the entire adventure have all be a dream , and they have be stick in the Arctic pack - ice the whole time . the hallucination of man near to death . aud try to wake Erik . aud do not sleep ... wake ... look ! Erik open he eye and , for a instant , he see helga . he blink and realize it be aud who be call he back to consciousness . suddenly color light begin to play to he face . erik bi-frost ... the rainbow Bridge . above they the aurora borealis stretch up , magnificent and awesome in the sky . Erik make he way through the other Viking . erik wake up ! the other slowly begin to rouse themselves from they icy slumber and sit up , awed by the sight . keitel ( whisper ) be we dead ? viking the rainbow Bridge . they all peer up at the ever-chang color of the aurora borealis , hang in the sky above they like organ-pipe . but something be happen . the light begin to fade to reveal a magical city on a mountain . the Viking realize that this be journey 's end ... they have reach asgaard ... the City of the god . the Viking all catch they breath and gaze in awe . erik asgaard ! harald missionary where ? sven' dad up there , you fathead . harald missionary up where ? harald look round quizzically at the other . it be clear that he can see nothing . erik look ! it 's real . harald look around at the other . harald hallucination be real . it 's no use ; harald can see nothing . the Viking , transfix by the sight of they fable home of the god , rise to they foot . aud whisper to Erik . aud the second note . erik the second note to wake the god ... Erik kneel in front of the horn . aud gently ... Erik blow ... a soft gentle note ... he take he mouth away , and smile at aud . once again the horn star to vibrate and the note get louder ... the ship start to vibrate ... louder and louder ... the whole landscape start to vibrate ... louder and louder grow the note until even the star in the sky be vibrate and then a magical thing start to happen ... the note fade as one by one the shimmer star start to fall out of the night sky ... they fall like silver snow ... until the ship ... the Viking ... asgaard ... the whole landscape be cover in sparkling dust ... then in the ensue silence the first light begin to glow in the hall of asgaard ... then another ... and another ... Erik stare as be bewitch and slowly begin to climb out of Golden Dragon .... but aud try to pull he back . aud Erik ! you have do what you come to do ! erik not quite ... aud look at he . aud blow the third note ! the note to take we home ! erik there be something I must ask the god ... aud no live man have ever set foot in the hall of asgaard ... the god will never let you return . Erik look at she ... for a moment ... but he know he have no choice . sven I come to find my grandfather . erik I have to go ... aud then I shall come too . erik ( stare at she ) no ... no ... aud I do not want to live without you . erik but , aud ... I ... I come to find someone ... aud be about to say " her ? " , but she bite the word back and look down at the ground . erik I be sorry , aud ... I really be . aud kiss Erik , who then turn and climb out of Golden Dragon and set off across the ice . sven follow . sven' dad wait for I ! I will be dead soon anyway ... keitel you can not go without I ! they follow . even harald missionary start to follow . harald where be they all go ? aud be not you afraid ? harald oh ... there 's nothing for I to be afraid of . harald smile and set off after the other . aud follow . the star have fall to form a shine , wind pathway up to the City of the god . this be what the Viking head for . between they and the citadel strange huge form rise up . the Viking approach and find the vast skeleton of the slain giant . the Viking be but tiny gnat-size figure wend they way between the vast figure . they climb the stairway - path of star , up the wind road and eventually fin themselves outside the massive door of asgaard . erik valhalla ... sven turn on harald . sven there ! it 's real ! it 's solid ! now do you believe we ? he pat the wall of valhalla -- the great Hall . harald reach out , but he hand go right through the wall . harald there be not anything . harald missionary walk straight through the wall and disappear from sight . the Viking gasp , and run up to feel the point where he disappear . the door be perfectly solid to they , and they jump pout of they skin as harald suddenly reappear again . harald you be have I on , be not you ? erik it 's valhalla -- where the warrior slain in battle go . aud it do not exist for he . sven' dad he 's just 's cynic . at this moment there be a creak and the great door mysteriously swing open . as if mesmerize , the Viking enter the hall of asgaard . the door slam behind they . they spin round , but the door have vanish ... no man have ever enter the hall of asgaard and leave alive ... Erik slowly start to cross the vast floor look around he as he do so . one by one the other Viking follow . after a while Erik stop . erik listen ! the Viking listen . they hear the sound of child laugh and shouting . Erik and he man follow through the column towards a pool of light . the scene that greet they eye be not at all what they have be prepare for . valhalla be not full of the warrior slain in battle , quaffing mead on the ale - bench and relive old battle -- it be , instead full of child romping , laugh , shouting , quarreling and play game ... chess , fencing ... dice ... tag , etc. , around a wide hearth fire . woman be cooking and do other housewifely thing ... weaving , make bread , etc . it be a thoroughly domestic scene . suddenly one of they turn at Erik . it be helga , whom Erik accidentally kill in scene one . she be once again knead dough . she have a red stain under she breast . helga oh good ! it 's Mr. wonderful ! Erik leap to she side . erik I have come to take you back to the land of the live . helga what a stupid idea . erik ( mortally hurt ) why ? helga what 's the point of be dead in the land of the live ? erik I will ask the god to give you life again ! helga look at Erik very skeptically . she obviously think he do not know what he 's talk about . aud react . Erik take helga 's hand -- and get cover in dough . helga have you try to ask the God for anything ? erik well ... no ... harald missionary who be he talk to ? aud sh! helga odin ! one of the child , throw penny against the wall , look round . child - odin I be busy . the Viking be recover from they surprise . viking odin ? helga ( get back to she knead ) he 's busy . erik be that odin ? helga you will have to wait till he 's finish he game . erik ( shouting across ) odin ! odin leave he game and saunter towards Erik . erik we have come from the world of midgard ... the child whom odin be play with point he hammer at the ground near Erik and a lightning bolt zap into it . Erik jump . child - thor clear off . odin no , wait , thor . erik you must help we . odin we do not have to help anybody . erik fenrir the Wolf cover the sun -- man fight and kill each other the whole time . odin why should we care ? erik because ... you be ... you be the god .... odin so ? erik bring the Age of ragnarok to a end and stop all this fight and bloodsh . harald look around at the Viking in increase desperation . harald this be ridiculous . viking sh ! harald right ! the other child - god have stop play around now and be watch Erik and odin . odin Erik the Viking ! the thing you seek be not in we power . we do not make man love each other or hate each other . erik but you be the god ! odin look ... Erik ... odin whistle . the other child look over they shoulder . from out of the darkness of the perimeter of the Hall , shadow emerge ... shadow that , as they shuffle and stumble into the light , reveal themselves to be the heroes that the Viking have expect to find in valhalla . but they be not hale and hearty giant quaffing mead and relive they great battle ... they be , in fact , a sorry lot ... the slain - in - battle still bear the hideous deformity of they fatal wound . most have a sword or a axe bury in some part of they anatomy . one have be cleft in twain ... the Viking react to this grisly gather as more and more of they emerge from the shadow . they gasp as they notice snorri , ivar , thorfinn , loki and leif the lucky . erik snorri ! ivar ! harald here we be stand on a bare mountain top talk to thin air . we notice that harald 's cloak be be blow about as if he be indeed on a bare mountain top . the other 's cloak be still . sven 's dad be gaze across at one horribly mutilate specimen . sven' dad dad ! keitel ( disbelievingly ) how can you tell ? sven' dad I will never forget he ! the bastard ! sven react . sven 's dad start to go berserk . sven' dad he drive I mad ! sven easy , dad ! sven' dad and he " you will never be a berserk if you lose you temper " ... sven dad ! sven' dad I hate you ! I hate you ! sven 's dad collapse against sven and sven comfort he , understandingly . a figure emerge from the throng of dead . it be thorfinn . sven look up at he . thorfinn you win , sven . loki what right have you to try and stop man fight , Erik the Viking ? there be glory in battle . there be rich to be make and win ... keitel make by you , loki ! loki by you -- keitel blacksmith ! do not you know , Erik , that be why he go with you ? ragnarok be good for he business ... keitel it 's not my business any more ! suddenly there be a howl ... a bitter howl that echoe above and around the hall of asgaard and that get more distant and more distant . everyone ( include the dead heroes and the god ) freeze and look up , listen . perhaps we cut away to the boil sky as it resolve itself into the shape of a wolf that snarl and slink away . odin turn to Erik as the howling recede . odin fenrir the Wolf have go , Erik . but will man cease fight each other ? that be not in we power ... odin start to laugh . all the other child start to laugh ... so do the dead heroes . Erik and he man look round uneasily . erik I have one more request before we return ... Erik turn towards helga , who be still stand at she trough of dough with she arm up to she elbow in flour . aud watch Erik with sadness in she heart . odin return ? you have set you foot in the hall of asgaard , Erik . you can not return . aud look round to see how the other react . it be as she have fear . Erik pale . the blood drain from the other 's face . aud whisper something to harald . harald look at she blankly . aud ( whisper ) please ! harald but you be all imagine this ... whatever it be . aud ( earnestly ) you be the only one who can . please . harald look around at the dumbfounded Viking . then he shrug and wander off , disappear through the close door of valhalla . erik you mean ... we must stay here forever ? as he say this Erik 's eye turn again towards helga . he be clearly think at least there be compensation ... odin , however , be laugh again . odin stay here ? ha ha ! this be valhalla . this be reserve for that slain - in - battle . horribly slain warrior ( grin cheerfully ) yeah ! we be the lucky one ! horribly slain friend of he yeah . it 's much better than die of old age . the ghastly and dismember dead warrior all chortle no end at the dismay write on the face of Erik and he man . at the same time there be a grind , wince sound . all that around the hearth - place fall back as a vast grate be wince up from out of the flame . the Viking look at each other . odin for you there be only the pit of hel ! as odin say this there be a roaring sound and the flame and smoke be suddenly reverse and as the roaring increase the flame be suck down altogether to reveal the black pit of hel itself . and now the pit be suck the Viking into it ... they hair blow ... they try to withstand the force that be draw they towards the abyss ... the god look on in some amusement . but some of the dead be concerned . sven' grandfather Son ! my son ! sven' dad get lose ! sven dad ! grandfather ! sven try to reconcile he father and grandfather , but it 's no use . he be suck towards the pit . viking help ! erik ( to helga ) I try to save you ! helga why should you care ? erik I do not know ! I just do ! Erik can no longer withstand the force that be suck he down to the pit of hel . suddenly , however , snorri have leapt from the rank of the dead . he grab Erik and try to stop he slide towards the pit of hel . but it 's no good . erik no ! let go , snorri ! snorri I have get you ! erik you will be suck down too ! snorri no! arrgh ! meanwhile , ivar and thorfinn and leif the lucky have also leapt forward to save they comrade . they put up a fantastic struggle but remorselessly they be all suck down . viking aagh ! the Viking clutch at the stone floor , they finger trace blood as they try to cling on ... but to no avail . the first be already toppling into the pit . viking noooh ! viking ah ! and the rest -- include aud -- soon follow . the mouth of the pit of hel , through which the Viking be now tumble higgledy - piggledy , be a round white disc set in the unutterable blackness of the pit . however , as the Viking free - fall slowly towards camera , they be light up by a faint , reddish glow from below . they be stare , wild - eye and scream as they fall . as they fall , Erik manage to smash he axe into the side of the pit. thorfinn grab he leg and hold onto sven 's foot . leif clutches at sven 's belt . sven 's dad hang onto sven 's foot . ivar clutches thorfinn 's foot . Erik clutches ivar 's leg and aud clutches Erik 's . they dangle like this for some second , and look fearfully beneath they . then they can see the infernal region of flame and molten lava ... somehow suggest the face of a huge and sinister creature . no wonder they be scared out of they wit . meanwhile , odin and thor appear at the top of the pit and look down with mild amusement . thor casually point he hammer and a streak of lightning zap Erik 's axe . it instantly glow red hot . Erik scream . suddenly we hear a new sound -- a long , high , sweet note . aud listen ! listen ! the third note ! but it 's no good . Erik have to let go of the red-hot axe . everyone scream as they start to plunge down towards the pit of hel . CUT to : golden dragon harald missionary be blow the horn resounding . harald missionary ( to himself ) I want to go home ... oooh ! suddenly Golden Dragon , the horn resounding and harald missionary shoot up into the air and disappear from sight . CUT back to : the pit of hel the Viking be look down as they fall -- they be still scared but gradually start laugh ... laugh as they fall down and down and down until they fall out of sight . we be leave with a blackness and just the white disc of the mouth of the pit of hel above , until the disc change magically into the moon . there be a series of splashes . the note begin to fade and the camera slowly pan down to reveal the Viking all fall into the duck pond back at ravensfjord . they be laugh and whooping and splash each other . erik I do not believe it ... ha ha ha ! it bring we home ! leif but who blew it ? ivar oh ! who care ? we be home ! thorfinn mum ! dad ! sven we be back ! sven embrace he father and dance he around with joy . all yo hoo ! we be here ! we be ... suddenly the joy drain from they face and they each gape in horror . what be it they see ? we cut to see that out of the hut the woman and child and old man be emerge -- but they be anything but happy . in fact they be all bound and gag . behind they emerge the sinister figure of halfdan the Black , gisli and maybe half a dozen armed man . halfdan and he croney no longer look sleek and self - assure . they be haggard and desperate . they face be streak with dirt and sweat , and they clothes be tear and soile . they have clearly be go through a lean time , since ragnarok end , and have descend on the village for revenge and for whatever plunder they can find . they have a few sackful of booty with they . they herd the woman , child and old man into a pathetic huddle in the middle of the village . halfdan be spitting evil and hatred . halfdan throw down you weapon -- or we shoot the child first . Erik hesitates ... the other look at he . what choice have they ? reluctantly , Erik throw he weapon into the pond . the other follow suit . halfdan watch . his man stand around he in a tight group with they back to each other . halfdan good ... good ... right , now we will just shoot the child anyway ... Erik be paralyze . what can they do ? half halfdan 's man be aim they crossbow at Erik and he comrade , and half be aim at the woman and child . they raise the crossbow to shoot . they finger tighten on the triggers . suddenly there be a scream from above . harald look out below ! everyone look up and , amazingly , out of the sky fall Golden Dragon and land fair and square on top of halfdan and he gang , squashing they flat . harald missionary stagger blearily from the wreckage . grimhild housewife harald ! she rush to harald , while the Viking rush to release they love one . great celebration all round . ivar look ! they all turn and see the sun rise . the villager gasp in wonder . they have never see the sun before . Erik look around and see thorfinn and sven with they arm round each other . aud look up as Erik smile at he and hold she to he . then they all turn and gaze at the spectacle of the sun return to the world . fade out : the end
