Wyatt 's group careen up and around the high mountain wall as if on a roller - coaster , follow the tiny , narrow path at a breathtaking clip , the trail finally plunging they back into the draw behind the Cowboys . they speed up to the opposite mouth of the cut , draw they pistol as the Cowboys gallop into the desert before they , unaware . wyatt Lay on ! they charge forward . see the empty desert ahead , the Cowboys pull up , look around in confusion . suddenly a volley of gunfire hit they from behind , knock several from the saddle . they spin around just as Wyatt 's group slam into they head - on , gun blazing , Cowboys tumble from the saddle leave and right , horse rear and toppling over backwards . pony deal run ! the remain Cowboys turn and dash into the desert . Wyatt shout : wyatt come on ! Wyatt 's group charge , the thoroughbred close the distance in second . vermillion stand in he stirrup , roaring like a animal as he plunge into they , swinging he quirt like a saber and lashing a cowboy across the face , make he tumble to the earth and bounce over the rock like a rag doll . McMasters close with another , throw a arm around he and jerking he from the saddle , snapping he neck .
