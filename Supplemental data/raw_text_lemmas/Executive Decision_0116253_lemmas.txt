' travis so , what 's the punch line ? grant refer to a open folder before he . grant less than a week ago , a small Russian army convoy be ambush outside of ashkhabad , near the iranian border . ten man be kill , a truck hijacked . he place several satellite photograph on the table , show the burn wreckage of several jeeps and soldier lie on the road . grant Recent intelligence give we strong reason to believe jaffa 's group be responsible . ( beat ) the cargo of that truck consist of 42 canister of dz - 5 , be relocate to a secret storage facility . ( continued ) 50 23 . continued : ( 4 ) 50 Travis stiffen slightly at the mention of the word . grant dz - 5 be the latest generation of a biogenic nerve toxin , far more lethal than any chemical weapon we have ever see ... he place several photograph on the table show Middle Eastern tribesman and soldier , lie in contort and misshapen heaps ; one photograph show a kurdish tribe - woman clutching a baby , they face freeze mask of agony , gasp for they last breath of life . travis ( sober ) I be aware of its capability , Captain . grant stop , he briefing finish for the moment . he look to director Nelson , the dci , who pick up a computer printout . dci a cross -check of the passenger and cargo manifest , Colonel , indicate a shipment of ' art object , ' lead pottery , 250 kilo in weight , on board Flight 343 ... ( beat ) the point of origin , final destination and the person assign to that shipment be all non - existent . Kaplan now resume , but Travis clearly understand the situation , grant carefully study he reaction . kaplan we have to consider , Colonel Travis , the strong possibility that gain the release of jaffa be only the first phase of a larger plan ... travis ( grave ) a major strike against the U.S. again grant speak up , refer to he note . he be obviously well prepare for this briefing . ( continued ) 50 51 through 53 24 . continued : ( 5 ) 50 grant assume only 10 canister , airburst over Washington ... we could expect between 50,000 to 100,000 death . anything inside a hundred mile of the coastline would be disastrous . a freeze moment and then Kaplan look directly at Travis . kaplan ( gravely ) meaning , Colonel Travis , if this scenario be true , the President would have no other choice but to order the plane destroy . travis ( confuse ) yes , sir , no other choice . but I be at a loss , Mr. Kaplan . if this be all true , where do my team fit in ? Kaplan glance at grant , then to the dci . kaplan because , we have be tell we may have another option , Colonel . which do concern you . ( to Nelson ) let 's get on with it , gentleman . Nelson nod to one of he aide who leave the room . omitted dci it 's a wild card , Colonel , but under the circumstance , it 's all we have get . you have already meet , I think , Peter cahill , a aeronautical engineer at darpa , a pioneer in stealth technology ... 51 through 53 54 25 . int . operation CENTER - day 54 close on a video screen where a computerize blueprint be display , a draw of a double - wall , ovoid cylinder , at the top of which be a inner and outer o-ring device : a series of circular , sucker - like cup , attach to a collection of pneumatic pump . the image change , a engineer 's draw , show the cylinder , similar to a submarine 's con tower , attach to the top of a radically design executive - style jet with stealth characteristic , feature sweep - back wing and a horizontal , rather than vertical , tail . another draw show the cylinder telescope upward , several time its original size , the delivery plane now position beneath and mate with a aircraft many time its size , a giant xb - 70 bomber . suddenly Travis get the picture , understanding where he fit into the loop . travis Jesus H. Christ ... all eye be on Travis . travis Excuse I , Mr. Kaplan , but I see where you be go with this . my team be thoroughly verse in carry out assault on hijacked aircraft . but on the ground , not five mile above the earth . ( beat ) I inform Mr. cahill two year ago that we have little use for this ' aircraft 's in special ops . this thing be design to transfer flight crew to and from strategic bomber , require special adaptation to the aircraft . ( look at cahill ) its application with a civilian aircraft be dismiss as pose too great a risk to the passenger . a hijacked aircraft eventually have to land somehwere where we can deal with it ... Travis realize the irony of he last statement , even before Kaplan speak up . ( continued ) 54 continued : 26 . 54 kaplan this do appear to be the exception to the rule . ( beat ) we say this be a wild card , Colonel . but if you team can board that airplane , determine if there be a bomb and take control of the situation , we at least have a fight chance . otherwise , four hundred and six passenger will have to be sacrifice . ( sober ; intense ) the President do not want to shoot down that plane , Colonel ... but he will . he cannot risk 50,000 american life . ( beat ) in he word this be a hail Mary pass . he have no other option . Kaplan continue to look at Travis . travis how much time ? grant speak up . grant you have to be airborne within the hour . Travis think a moment and then nod , the soldier 's acceptance of duty . he look at cahill . travis one question . you have enough confidence in this gadget to stake you life on it , under this circumstance ? cahill it 's be modify ... the pump 's much stronger ... even without the mate collar there be a appropriate hatch on the 747 and the wide surface area of the aircraft should be sufficient for a link - up ... ( beat ) I would have to say I have extreme confidence in its application , even under the less than optimum circumstance . ( continued ) 54 54a 27 . continued : ( 2 ) 54 travis well , good . because I want you to go along . I do not want anything leave to chance . cahill be stunne . he start to speak but a wither look from the dci shut he up . cahill look sick . Kaplan speak up , deal he last card . kaplan I think one addition to the team be call for , Colonel . a expert in Arabic dialect , someone who have make a careful study of Ali 's life , who know how he think , how he operate ... Travis turn and look at grant , they eye lock . this be unanticipate by grant and he face show it . the Major - General , Travis 's boss speak up . major-general I see absolutely no need for Captain grant 's involvement in the actual operation . he can accomplish a advisory role right from here in Operations . kaplan on the contrary , General , I think he actual presence could prove crucial . Captain grant might be able to forecast something Ali be go to do , before he do it . major -general Mr. Kaplan , it 's go to be difficult enough for the Colonel and he man ... Travis speak out . travis Excuse I , General . i'11 take he . he could prove useful . he fix grant with a look that say , " okay , let 's see how you handle the real thing . " ext . airforce base - OPEN jeep - dawn 54a move swiftly across the flight line , pass hangar and military aircraft . ( continued ) 54 a 28 . continued : 54a Travis 's special force driver be at the wheel , Travis in the front seat , grant in the rear . grant , windblown and chill , seem uncomfortable and nervous , a mark change from he confident bear at the Pentagon . Travis turn in he seat . travis curious why I do not vote against you come , Captain ? grant be curious but remain silent . travis because this whole operation be you idea , be not it ? you little brainstorm . the look on grant 's face say it all . grant that 's what I get pay for , Colonel . travis and my boy get pay for put it on the line . I be not fault you idea , Captain . like Kaplan say , under the circumstance it 's a brilliant plan . and crazy enough that it just might work . ( beat ) except we know we should not be do it in the first place , do not we ? grant ( uncomfortable ) I be not sure I follow you , sir . travis then I will enlighten you . where you intel boy fuck up be cooking up this hare - brain scheme to put jaffa on trial in the first place . grant you be mistaken , Colonel . we have nothing to do with jaffa 's abduction ... ( continued ) 54 a 29 . continued : ( 2 ) 54a travis oh , horse shit . I know a hell of a lot more about what go on in you world than you think . it be a c.i.a. op , a executive decision from the beginning . we both play for the same team , Captain . the only difference be , you do not have to pull the trigger . grant I have no involvement with that operation , Colonel . ( beat ) but I agree with it in principle . jafa be a international criminal and have to be bring to justice . Men like that have to know they be not beyond the reach of the law . travis Law ? the only law animal like jaffa and Ali understand come from the end of a gun . ( beat ) you should have kill they all when you have the chance . grant reflect on this . grant well , that 's all a moot point , be not it ? no matter what , jaffa be home free . a cold look from Travis . travis do not count on it , Captain . the Jeep pull to a halt beside a massive hangar , just as a ch-46 helicopter roar into view over the top , quickly settling to the tarmac , Travis and grant turn to avoid the prop wash . emerging from the helicopter be seven man , wear watch cap , dark green pullover , black cargo - pockete pants , and light weight , crepe-sol boot . quickly they unload dark duffel bag and abs plastic suitcase . Travis swing from the Jeep , leave grant behind , make he way to the team . they cluster momentarily , Travis warmly greeting they . ( continued ) 54 a 30 . continued : ( 3 ) 54a grant see a very close - knit , highly motivate and bond team , but he see as well the fear in they eye , the adrenaline rush , and as they glance towards he , the automatic distrust of outsider . travis ( shouting ) outstanding , gentleman . any problem ? one of the man , baker , good - nature , wide beam face speak up . baker ( shouting ) almost miss cappy . caught he in he driveway , pole in he hand , head for the key . Travis look across at cappy , 48 , black , lean , chisele , intelligent feature , wear in contrast to the other a black insulate jumpsuit , cover with dozen of pocket and pouch . on he head be a floppy fatigue hat , several trout fly in the brim . cappy ( shouting ) damn near make it , too . several of the man look up , see grant as he approach . Travis turn , look at grant . travis boy , this be Captain grant , i.s.a . he 's along in case we get into any serious trouble . let 's go . we will brief in flight . the man pick up they gear , walk towards the hangar . another of the man , a wiry , intense chicano , nickname " rat " for he expertise in surreptitious entry , look around he , search for something . rat Colonel , I do not see the support van . be we takin ' it ? travis not this time , Rat . we be travel light . the huge door begin to part ... 55 55 a 31 . int . hangar ( AIR force base ) - day 55 as the door rumble open , the man walk forward , casting long backlit shadow before they as they step through the hangar door . they stop , stare at something inside the cavernous hangar . baker what the hell be that ? charlie ( pilot 's drawl ) well , it be not make the cover of popular mechanic . reverse angle 55 a we see a hawk - like aircraft of black , anodize titanium , so rakish and streamline it look almost in flight just sit on the ground . a flight crew , finish last minute service and check on the high - tech bird , remove they service equipment , the pilot enter the craft . as the team approach the plane , cahill appear from inside . he call out to Travis , gesture towards the man . cahill ( shouting ) too much weight ! never design for this many -- never get off the ground ! ( beat ) and we be run late . for every minute we be here , we have to make up ten in the air . get to go ! Travis turn to the man , point to the equipment . travis ( shouting ) cut it down ! Close - quarter weapon , bomb kit , detection and surveillance gear , and the sleep agent . dump the rest ! let 's go ! immediately the team begin digging through the equip - ment , take only the essential item , leave the rest on the hangar floor . as Travis and grant stand next to each other , Travis 's Driver appear . driver Sir , I have you call to s.a.s command in London . ' cousin Reggie ' be on the scrambler . grant seem very curious as Travis take the call ona sat - com briefcase unit , but Travis 's word be drown out as the powerful engine on the jet begin to power up . 56 57 57a 58 59 32 . ext . runway - day 56 the delivery plane have taxi into position and hold , engine whining . the plane pivot hard , aim down the runway , the engine revving to full burner , heat wave obscuring frame as the jet accelerate ... omitted 57 int . military base ( england ) - prison cell - day 57a where in the dim light of the cold cell , jaffa sit on he bunk , dress in gray overall . suddenly the heavy steel door swing open and several american mps enter , pull jaffa to he foot , put he in handcuffs . as the startle jaffa be lead from he cell , he see a american diplomat , stare at he coldly from the hallway . as he 's ushere down the hall , jaffa realize something significant have take place . ext . english countryside ( near london ) - day 58 a convoy of U.S. and british military vehicle fly past on a country highway , the access road block by military police . a sign read : " london 150 km " be see in the f.g . in the third vehicle from the lead , jaffa sit in a armored Range Rover , surround by soldier , the diplo - mat seat beside he . int . delivery plane - day 59 we pull back to reveal the interior , spartan but func - tional . fold -down jump seat accommodate the team , the rear of the jet devote to rack of miniaturized elec- tronic and navigational gear . the predominant feature of the jet , however , be the dome-like appendage swell from the ceiling near the cockpit . a pressurize hatch be locate in the center of the dome , surround by a series of gauge , lever and switch . the ship be intermittently buffete by turbulence , obviously not the best of fly condition . the man be intense and highly focus as they listen to Travis ' briefing of the bizarre mission they be about to undertake . grant be obviously the outsider , sit near the rear of the aircraft . ( continued ) 59 33 . continued : 59 travis the stake be high on this one , gentleman , the most important mission we have ever be hand . this assault be untest and carry more than the usual element of chance , but under the circumstance , it 's the only chance that people on board have . a quick look to grant , then to cahill . travis otherwise , it 's a standard suppression op , just as if we have board on the ground . ( beat ) all right , let 's go through it . Baker . Baker turn to a video screen , part of a portable high - tech communication and tracking system . he plot a simulate course , show a intercept point of the 747 and the delivery plane over the Atlantic . baker the 747 's transponder and radar be off , but the e2 now have a fix on they . we intercept should be about here , roughly a hour out of London . ( beat ) that give we four hour on board before she reach the hundred mile limit . travis give I that schematic . Baker snap a explode - view cell , show the 747 in intricate detail , into a light box . the team study the glow , back - light schematic . travis grant , you be up after Baker , find a hole and sit tight while Baker set up the intercom link with the Pentagon . sleep - agent be next .

I have be brief on , the effect on most subject be a gradual drowsiness for about thirty second before unconsciousness . travis ( curious ) correct . what 's you point ? grant thirty second may be too long . Ali be highly intelligent , act instinctually , by nature suspicious of everything . the slight indication he mission have be comprise could result ina disastrous reaction on he part . Travis consider this . travis good point . Baker ? baker I can increase the saturation . it will put ‘em out instantly but it 's pretty risky . we could lose someone before we cycle the gas out . Travis look at grant . travis increase it . we will take the chance . catman , you ready to fly it ? catman , smooth , confident , a pilot 's manual for a 747 open on he lap , look up . ( continued ) 59 continued : ( 3 ) catman 35 . 59 once we clear the flight crew from the cockpit , no problem . should be on auto pilot but even if it be not , plane pretty well fly itself . travis once we have get control , Rat , you and cappy start the sweep through the forward baggage compartment . if we find a bomb we divert . Baker . catman ( check he map ) s.a.c. base at mcneil , Greenland be we best bet . rat and if this bitch have a cappy , resolve , open a fold , case contain a fantastic array he look up . cappy well then , I guess you all mine . a sober moment pass through the travis all right . that 's it . you equipment . short fuse ? three -section soft of miniature bomb tool . ass be group . see to grant look over at cahill , busily at work on a small , calculator - like device . grant last minute calculation ? cahill ( sheepishly ) no .
