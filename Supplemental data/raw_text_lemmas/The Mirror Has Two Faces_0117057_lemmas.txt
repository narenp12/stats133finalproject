Gregory and Henry sit in the back of the classroom while Rose give a impassion lecture to she spellbound student . rose Â«+ . I believe it 's we addiction to illusion like perfect sex and true love that be actually keep people today separate and alone . " falling in love " be a man-made conceit . before the industrial Revolution - before man leave the home for business and woman become the leisure class - before sex and beauty be use as marketing tool for the propagation of the species - she refer to daguerreotype and tintypes depict image of woman as object of beauty . rose ( cont would ) what draw man and woman together ? I can tell you one thing - it must have be a lot more real than what 's draw they today . a fifty percent aivorce rate among marry couple - more single parent than you can count . which be fine - but why ? because people want child and not relationship . Relationships be too hard . why ? because we be ask to meet ridiculous , romantic standard ! Gregory be mesmerize . rose ( cont would ) do you know how many lonely people there be wait for this perfect , romantic love - this illusion when actually they perfect mate might be right in front of they only they can not recognize it . ( more ) comtinued continued : 34 . rose ( cont would ) and sex , well , how often have you hear '' oh he be not my type " , " oh she 's do not turn I on " and people stay alone . this obsession with beauty and lust while everything around we be decaye ... everyone 's lover have to be attractive and successful and funny and charming and the truth be , there simply be not enough funny , successful , attractive , charming people to go around . we be human ~ we spit and sweat and gain weight and age and why be not that all right ?! because of the malicious fantasy create by fashion designer and commercial about deodorant share that tell we it 's not . " do not settle for second best " " be the best , smell the best , get the beautiful guy , lose the weight and marry a adonis " - " perfect love do exit ~ right , here in this bottle for only 29.99 . " and whether we be conscious of it or not , we fall for it . the idea of have to " fall in love " have become the most contagious and deadly virus of twentieth century ~ kill relationship before they can even begin ... leave man and woman who have so much to offer - exclude . as if relationship be only mean for the select , the beautiful and the few instead of be everyone 's birthright . Rose be panting . she have give this speech without a breath . the class , and Gregory , sit stunne . wait . Rose feel expose for a moment , and try to sum up . rose ( cont would ) ( genuine belief ) we live in such a transitory world . people marry for love , which fade ... or beauty or passion ... which fade . you ever notice how most friendship last longer than most marriage .? ( more ) continued 35 . continued : ( 2 ) rose ( cont would ) be it even possible anymore for a man and a woman to truly see each other and come together for something real ?.... I do not know .... ( pause ) question , comment . the class break out into applause . Rose smile , feel great love for this kid . Gregory look as if he 's be transformed by a revelation . ext . campus ~- day .

Henry stop , surprised . gregory I do not notice how she look . henry that 's my point . gregory I have have beautiful woman Henry . I have have great sex . and I be alone ... I want to meet she . henry look - you be come off of jessie again . you be not think straight . ( more ) continued continued : int , rose 36 . henry ( cont would ) beside , in my opinion , sex be the only . reason people get together because it 's the only divine act human can accomplish . it fulfill everyone 's inherent desire to return to God . it be my belief that come will replace praying in the 2ist century . I be think of write a theological treatise on it and call , it " theoboffism " . gregory all I know be , I be lonely . maybe jessie be my one real love - so what ? maybe my mother be right or maybe we be only allow one a lifetime and I get stick with someone I can not have . but maybe there 's something else I can have . something I can trust , feel safe with , build with ... henry with she !? gregory well ... I do not know . maybe . why not ? she 's seem like a fascinating woman . henry Fine . but no matter what you want in a woman , you can not deny the fact that there have to be a physical attraction too . gregory I be not so sure .
