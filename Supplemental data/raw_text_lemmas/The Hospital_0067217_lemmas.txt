( she take she drink and cross to the sofa ) that be to say , he suddenly sink to he knee at the back of the room and begin to talk fluently in a language which no one have ever hear before . this sort of thing happen frequently at pentecostal meeting , and they begin to happen regularly to my father . ( she sit ) it be not unusual to walk into we home and find my father sit in he office , utterly serene and happily speak to the air in this strange foreign tongue . I be , at that time twenty year old and have my obligatory affair with a minority group , in my case a hopi indian , a post - graduate fellow at Harvard do he doctorate in the aboriginal language of the Southwest . one day , I bring the indian boy home just as my father be sink to he knee in the entrance foyer in one of he trances . the indian wheeled in he track and say , " well , I will be a sonofabitch . " you see , my father be speak a Apache dialect , a obscure dialect at that , speak only by a rag band of unreconstructed Indians who have reject the reservation and be live in total isolation in the Sierra madre Mountains of northern Mexico . well ! what do you say to that , Dr. bock ? bock ( who have be stare at she as if she be insane ) what the hell be I suppose to say to that , miss drummond ? Barbara throw back she head and roar with laughter . bock I be sit here booz and , all of a sudden , you start tell I some dement story about you father 's religious conversion . barbara no , no , you miss the point , Doctor . not my father 's conversion -- mine . you see , I have be hit the acid pretty regularly at that time . I have achieve a few minor sensory deformity , some suicidal despair , but nothing as wild as fluency in a obscure Apache dialect . I mean , like wow , man ! I mean , here be live afflatus right before my eye ! within a week , my father have close he beacon Hill practice and set out to start a mission in the mexican mountain . and I turn in my s.d.s. card and my crash helmet and follow he . it be a disaster , at least for I . my father have receive the revelation , not I . he stand gaunt on a mountain slope and preach the apocalypse to solemnly amused Indians . I masturbate a great deal . we live in a grass wickiup and eat raw rabbit and crush piñon nut . it be hideous . within two month , I be back in Boston , a hollow shell and dizzy with dengue , disenchant with everything . I turn to austerity , comb my hair tight and enter nursing school . I become haggard , drive and have shamelessly incestuous dream about my father . I take up with some of the senior staff at the hospital . one of they , a portly psychiatrist , explain I be generate by a unresolved lust for my father . I apparently crack up . one day , they find I walk to work naked and scream obscenity . there be talk of institutionalize I , so I pack a bag and go back to my father in the Sierra madre Mountains . I have be there ever since . that 's three year . my father be , of course , mad as a hatter . I watch over he and have be curiously content . you see , Doctor , I believe in everything . she pause , she story over . throughout , bock have be try to keep he glower eye on the desktop . during she long narrative , he once seize the bottle and take a swig . mostly he be find the experience murkily sensual . his glance keep darting out from under he brow to surreptitiously look at the beautiful long tan leg ; or , when she bend for the drink she set on the floor , to peer down the flap open scallop neck of she dress ; she be bra-less . she , on the other hand , have be crossing and uncross she leg , bend , stretch , so that she short dress have ride up almost to she waist and be save from utter exhibitionism only by the darkness of the shadow . she seem unaffected by bock 's voyeuristic interest in she , but she be surely not unaware of it . it be hard to believe she be not court he attention . bock now what be that all about , miss drummond ? barbara I think I be obvious as hell . I be try to tell you I have a thing for middle - age man . bock I admire you candor . barbara you have be admire a lot more than that . bock look up , and they suddenly find they eye lock . the dark , dense air in the room fairly steam with incipient sexuality . bock ( look down again ) you be waste you time . I have be impotent for year . barbara rubbish . with a crash of he fist on the desktop , bock stand ; he be in a drunken rage . bock ( lurch about ) what the hell 's wrong with be impotent ? my God , you kid be more hang up on sex than the victorian ! I have get a son , twenty - three . I throw he out of the house last year . pietistic little humbug . he preach universal love and despise everyone . he have a blanket contempt for the middle class , even its decency . he detest my mother because she have petit bourgeois pride in she son the doctor . I can not tell you how brutishly he ignore that rather good old lady . when she die , he do not even come to the funeral . he think the chapel service a hypocrisy . his generation do not live with lie , he tell I . " everybody life with lie , " I say . I grab he by he poncho , drag he the full length of we seven-room despicably affluent middle - class apartment and flung he out . I have not see he since . but do you know what he say to I as he stand there on that landing on the verge of tear . he shriek at I : " you old fink ! you can not even get it up anymore ! " that be it , you see . that be he real revolution . it be not racism and the oppress poor and the war in Vietnam . the ultimate american societal sickness be a limp dingus . hah ! ( he lurch about , laugh rustily ) my God , if there be a despise and misunderstand minority in this country , it 's we poor impotent bastard . well , I be impotent and proud of it ! impotence be beautiful , baby ! ( he raise a militant fist ) power to the impotent ! right on , baby ! barbara ( smile ) right on . bock ( stare drunkenly at she ) when I say impotent , I do not mean merely limp . disagreeable as it may be for a woman , a man may sometimes lust for other thing , something less transient than a erection , some sense of permanent worth . that 's what medicine be for I , my reason for be . when I be thirty - four , miss drummond , I present a paper before the annual convention of the Society of clinical investigation that pioneer the whole goddam field of immunology . a breakthrough ! I be in all the textbooks . I happen to be a eminent man , miss drummond . and you want to know something , miss drummond ? I do not give a goddam . when I say I be impotent , I mean I have lose even my desire for work , which be a hell of a lot more primal a passion than sex . I have lose my raison d'etre , my purpose , the only thing I ever truly love . it 's all rubbish anyway . transplant , antibody , we manufacture gene , we can produce birth ectogenetically , we can practically clone people like carrot , and half the kid in this ghetto have not even be inoculate for polio ! we have assemble the most enormous medical establishment ever conceive , and people be sicker than ever ! we cure nothing ! we heal nothing ! the whole goddam wretch world be strangulate in front of we eye ! that 's what I mean when I say impotent ! you do not know what the hell I be talk about , do you ? barbara of course , I do . bock I be tired , I be terribly tired , miss drummond . and I hurt , and I have get nothing go for I anymore . can you understand that ? barbara yes , of course . bock then can you understand that the only admissable matter leave be death ? he suspect he be go to cry and turn quickly away . he sit heavily and fight he tear . barbara sound to I like a familiar case of morbid menopause . bock oh Christ . barbara well , it 's hard for I to take you despair very seriously , Doctor . you obviously enjoy it so much . bock oh , bugger off . that 's all I need now , clinical insight . some cockamamie twenty - five-year-old ... barbara twenty -seven . bock ... acidhead 's go to reassure I about menopause now . look , I would like to be alone , so why do not you beat it ? Close the door and turn off the light on you way out . they be both suddenly conscious of a third presence in the room . they look to the door where Mr. blacktree , fully clothed again and carry he coat , be stand in the doorway . Barbara uncross she long leg and stand . barbara ( crossing to the door ) Mr. blacktree disapprove of my miniskirt , but it be the only thing I have to come to the city with . back at the tribe , I wear ankle - length buckskin . bock swell . just close the door and turn off the light . Barbara regards he hunch form and , murmure in Apache , she exit , close the door . in the subsequent hush , thunder rumble and crash . wind sweep the rain against the window pane . the sound go unheeded by bock , still as marble . slowly , he raise he head and sigh and then fish about in he jacket pocket to bring out the bottle of potassium and syringe . he take off he jacket , roll up he shirtsleeve , poke about for the vein . he remove he trouser belt , which he tie tightly about he upper arm for a tourniquet . now , he tear the wrapping of the syringe and fit the needle to it . fiddle about in the pocket of he jacket , he finally find a crumpled pack of cigarettes . he light one and return to the business of kill himself , puffing expressionlessly as he do . Thunder rumble and rain slashes . he carefully draw just the right amount of potassium from the bottle to the syringe , peer at the procedure against the light of he desk lamp . he set the cigarette on the ashtray , switch the hypodermic to he right hand , hold he leave arm rigidly out under the light of the lamp ... barbara' voice ( off-screen ) what be you shoot , Doc ? he turn slowly to the doorway , he bare leave arm still rigidly extend , the belt dangle , the hypodermic clench in he other hand . Barbara be perfectly frame in the doorway . he stare at she , slowly suffuse with the numb , blind , total rage of the abort suicide . the thunder crash . bock ( barely get the word out ) leave I alone ... she approach the desk affably , turn the potassium around to read the label . barbara potassium . you take enough of this stuff , it will kill you , doc. ( move toward the couch ) it occur to I that I might have read you wrong , that you really be suicidal . so I come back . bock 's rage erupt . he crash the hypodermic syringe down , shatter it . the potassium puddle on the wood . bock ( hysterical rage ) who the hell ask you ! he move around the desk , a shambling bear of a man , a leather belt dangle dementedly from he arm , tear coursing down he cheek . he advance on she in a stuperous shuffle . bock who the hell ask you ! she regards he lumber approach with a faint , grotesquely sensual smile . he reach with he naked leave arm to the neck of she dress and , with one savage wrench , rip she stark naked , sobbing through hysterical tear . bock leave I alone ! why the hell do not you leave I alone ! he be on she , crush she down into the shadow of the couch , ravenous at she neck and shoulder in a brutish assault , sobbing . bock why do not you let I do it ? who the hell ask you ! throughout the scene , camera move slowly in through the flesh and fury to a intense two - shot of this terrify act of love . then slowly over bock 's plunging shoulder to the woman 's face . she gasp at the moment of penetration , then she lovely face slowly shape into smile serenity . bock sob ; even in the shadow we can see the path of the tear on he cheek . abrupt silence . outside the hospital , night . 4:00 a.m. the quiet , black street glisten wetly in the puddle of lamplight . the steinmetz pavilion , tenth floor the night shift be finish up . theresa campanella , r.n. , a high -strung girl in she early twenty , stand at a water tap hold a glass and pop some pill in she mouth . to the room : campanella well , I will see you . tenth floor corridor . night campanella come out of the dialysis room , put on she coat and walk to ... holly pavilion lobby . night campanella move down the empty corridor . all the door be close now ; only the overhead light in the background of the corridor glow weakly . campanella put a cigarette in she mouth , pause to look for match ; she have not any . scowl with annoyance , she continue to the lobby and stop by a partially visible white - jackete figure read a newspaper . campanella do you have a match , Doctor ? she take the match , light she cigarette , inhale deeply , when he suddenly sandbag she from behind . she go down . bock's office . daybreak , wednesday cover by bock 's overcoat , Barbara toss and turn on the couch in a small nightmare . through the window come the first gray wash of dawn . full shot of Barbara , awake and up on one elbow on the verge of a scream . she look around the room . it be dark , empty , silent . across Barbara look through the door to the secretarial office . it be likewise dark , but suddenly the light go on and , a moment later , bock enter . he hold a container of coffee in each hand and have something white drape over he forearm . from under bock 's bulky coat , Barbara watch he lumber to he desk , where he set the container of coffee down . he drop the whitish garment over the back of a chair and then sit . he hoist a bulg folder of correspondence from he filing tray and hunch to work , read . after a moment , he regards the silent figure on the couch across the room . bock you would not be awake . barbara what time be it ? he rise , pick up the second container and white dress from the chair . she reach out a arm for the coffee . bock hold up -- a nurse 's uniform . bock I swipe this for you out of the nurse ' locker room .

God be admit to this hospital last Monday under the name of guernsey ... room 806 . morning . ( flashback ) a cheerless , gray sunlight fill the room as the fragile , white - haire and bearded old guernsey ( whose admittance to the hospital be the open scene of the film ) be be help into the room by nurse Felicia chile . she solicitously help the wispy old man off with he coat and jacket and hat which she put in the armoire . with palsie finger , the little old man unknot he stringy tie and unbutton the collar , which be three size too large . in the other bed , drummond 's eye slowly open . drummond ( off-screen ) I be instantly aware of a divine presence . the old man be slip out of he clothes to expose a thin little body in a tear nightshirt . drummond ( off-screen ) I be convinced this porcelain old man be , in fact , a angel of the Lord ... the old man sit back , wheeze a little . nurse chile smile nicely at he and take she leave . for a moment , drummond lie rigidly on he bed , stare dully into the air and the old man sit with he hunch back to we . the room be silent except for he rheumy wheeze . drummond ( off-screen ) ... perhaps even Christ himself . after a moment , the old man rise and go to the washbasin and , with some wheeze , spit into it . he shuffles back to bed . Dr. schaefer come into the room with a professional smile and the patient guernsey 's chart . drummond ( off-screen ) we savior be , it seem , suffer from emphysema . schaefer perches on the bed beside guernsey and begin to take he history . drummond ( off-screen ) he be relentlessly subject to the benefit of modern medicine . he be misdiagnose , mismedicate , and put into shock by Dr. schaefer ; race off to intensive Care , where the resident compound the blunder and induce a coma . I can tell you with authority that God be indeed dead . he die last Monday under the name of guernsey . close - up of drummond in deep shadow show he sleep . drummond ( off-screen ) a few hour later , he appear to I in a revelation . room 806 . night , 7:00 p.m. the room be light only by the yellow light from the half - open bathroom door . guernsey walk out of the shadow , hand raise . he shuffles to drummond 's bedside and look down on he from he frail height . guernsey ( softly ) rise up , drummond . you be dead , now you be restore . drummond 's eye open and roll to the direction of the voice . drummond be p.o.v. : guernsey , dress only in he hospital shift , be shuffle up and down the aisle of the room , hand clasped behind he back like a mittel - european intellectual , head hunch forward -- a little old man with a white beard talk to himself . guernsey that who kill you and that who kill I will die in we place . you be the paraclete of caborca , the wrath of the lamb . the angel of the bottomless pit . guernsey close he eye in religious ecstacy . guernsey in this fashion have it be reveal to you . drummond start to sob and slowly sit up in he bed , imbue with belief . he look mutely up at the frail old man , who now raise he right hand and he face be transfigure into vast majesty . guernsey ( thunder out ) the age be close ! the end be at hand ! the seal be break ! so say , he revert to the little old man he be , wheeze a bit , and with some effort , climb back on he bed and lie there , eye close . his thin , high nose project from the whiteness of he face . he sigh the rattling last sigh of life and die . camera dolly slowly to close - up of drummond lie motionless on he bed . his eye be wide , glint in the shadow , a man imbue . his cheek be wet with tear of exaltation . drummond ( off-screen ) well ! not quite the burn bush perhaps but prodigal enough for I . I be to avenge the death of God and my own brutalization . I be to kill doctor schaefer , ive and welbeck and the dialysis nurse miss campanella , whose negligence cause my coma . full shot of drummond . he raise he leave hand , flex he finger . then he move he other arm , he head , he shoulder . obviously , he be regain he faculty . drummond ( off-screen ) I await a further sign from God , which be give to I later that evening . Dr. schaefer , it seem , have arrange a assignation with a girl from the hematology lab name Sheila . across drummond to the now empty other bed . all the light be on . pan on nurse penny canduso and a orderly wheeling away the wrap body of guernsey . intern schaefer , at the door , consider the empty bed with interest . move to the bedtable , he pick up the receiver of the phone . schaefer ( on phone ) hey Sheila , this be Howard , Sheila . hey listen , I get we a bed for tonight . a real , honest - to - god bed . room 806 . night reprise the scene originally play under credit where Dr. schaefer and he girlfriend Sheila sneak into the room and undress . giggles and shushing , goose and fondle . sheila Boy , I sure hope nobody walk in . during the replay , however , a additional segment be add . at one point , the girl , hang she dress in the armoire , turn and hold something up . sheila what 's this in you pocket ? schaefer that 's my insulin . put it back . sheila what do you take insulin for ? diabete ? I do not know you be a diabetic . schaefer it be not contagious , do not worry about it . they head for the unoccupy bed . close - up on drummond 's profile . room 806 Dark , hushed . schaefer 's girl be leave ; she tiptoe to the door , peek out . apparently , the coast be clear . she quickly slip out . room 806 . day drummond on he chair . Barbara perch on one side of she father 's bed , bock on the other . William mead sleep on . bock and you put schaefer 's insulin into the i.v. jar . drummond yes . and then a second nurse come and plugge the i.v. jar into schaefer .
