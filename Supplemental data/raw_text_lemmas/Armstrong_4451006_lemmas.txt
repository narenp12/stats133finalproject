armst : rong by josh Singer base in part upon the book first man by James hansen writer 's revise draft May 11 , 2016 over black : static . and then faint , choppy military comm . playback from a old reel - to-reel . slowly we realize ... it 's in Russian . a voice begin to translate ... gagarin ( on tape , russian ) slow rotation , stage cutoff . english translator calculate orbit achieve . slow rotation , stage cutoff . calculate orbit achieve . credit over black . small font , the corner of the screen . but we focus remain on what we be hearing . [ note : this scene be play entirely over black as credit roll ] gagarin ( on tape , russian ) a sense of weightlessness ... english translator I see , I be over America . a sense of weightlessness , I see , I ... I be over America . murmur . a reaction . then a click ; the comm go silent . as credit continue , we hear papers shuffling ; chair creaking . voice # 1 ( sorenson ) Jack need a public response . this voice be a bit clearer . but only a bit . it still feel like lo-fi tape of a meeting . a important meeting . voice # 2 ( low ) shepard 's schedule ... in 2 week . sorenson gagarin orbite three time , a suborbital flight 's not a response . voice # 3 ( weisner ) ( hard to hear ) why not ... something ... clearer long - term benefit . desalinization -- sorenson Salt water 's not gonna sell , Jerry . ( then ) be there no way we current program can compete with the Soviets ? voice # 4 ( gilruth ) not we current program . the Soviets be too far ahead . we feel the room turn to this new voice . quiet . command . we do not know it yet , but this be bob gilruth . gilruth the only way to win be to pick a mission so far off , require so many new scientific development that we could be first to get there . sorenson you have something in mind ? we hear paper shuffle . a report dropped on a table . gilruth it 's ... speculative . a beat . more paper shuffling . sorenson how much will this -- low thirty five , maybe forty . weisner forty million doll ... gilruth billion . forty billion dollar . weisner Jesus Christ . we hear a door open . a whisper . sorenson Jack 's ready for we . the sound of chair pushed back . Men shuffling out . then .. sorenson Bob , hold up ... ( sotto ) he will not like the price tag but if I can sell it , where would we start ? gilruth well . we be gonna need more man . the credit end . a moment of silence over black . then we hear it . a low rumble . it grow louder ... then louder still . a scream engine . and howling wind . burst of static . faint comm . it surround we , fill we with dread , pounding US into -- int . x-15 cockpit , high range , above edward afb - day a pair of blue eye . ticking back and forth . rapidly . we be knock out by this first image , by the eye , oblivious to the RAW and frightening wall of SOUND all around we . joe ( comm ) data check ? neil ( 0.c. ) 2 apu on . cabin pressure be good , 3500 on # 1 , 3355 on # 2 . platform internal power . pull back to find neil armstrong , 31 , in a silver pressure suit and helmet . Neil be intense and intensely focused , impressive give the severe turbulence that bang he around the cockpit . joe ( comm ) what 's you mixing chamber ? neil ( into comm ) - 44 and - 45 . butch ( comm ) two minute point . neil ( into comm ) mh circuit breaker on ... Neil flip a switch on the low tech console . he glance up from the analogue dial and out the cockpit window ... and if the plane look like a rocket , it 's ' cause it be . this be the X - 15 . and as we be about to see , it 's the fastest fucking aircraft ever made . but just now , it be not fly ... or rather , not fly alone . Neil 's X - 15 be attach to the wing of a b-52 -- ball 8 , a four engine behemoth that 's shaking even more than the X - 15 . it 's more than a bit terrifying , but Neil calmly hit another switch as he 's knocked across the cockpit . neil ( into comm ) protocol be off . Little bumpy . it 's classic armstrong understatement ; underscore as we see the B - 52 pilot ( butch ) tossed against the window of he plane . butch ( comm ) worst it 's ever be , real rough up here , fluctuate a half degree each side . this just drive Neil into deeper focus . neil ( into comm ) velocity 900 fps , altitude joe ( comm ) 44,500 , pitch attitude level . copy . Neil , we be read you heart rate at 145 . no reply . Neil 's eye tick methodically from gauge to gauge . joe ( comm ) Neil , we be read you heart rate at 145 , do you copy ? neil ( into comm ) copy Joe . igniter ready to light . Neil 's not gonna engage . whatever adrenaline spike he body be experience , Neil 's determine to remain detach . a beat . we can almost hear joe WALKER , on the other end of the comm , debate whether to abort . at last , he relent . joe ( comm ) okay . Arm switch lite neil ( into comm ) check . go to prime . ammonia up . in the bumpy cockpit , Neil spring back into action . butch ( comm ) neil ( comm ) twenty second to drop -- rog , precool on , lox pump bear plus eight . butch ( comm ) ( cont 'd ) neil ( into comm ) ten second -- igniter idle , ready to launch on 3 , 2 , 1 , release ... suddenly the X - 15 be released from the wing of the B - 52 . through the cockpit window , we see the b-52 rise sharply as the x-15 drop in free fall ... a free fall we feel in we gut because we 're not cutting away . and if you have not figure it out by now , we 're gonna be in the cockpit with neil for this entire heart - pounding ride . so . we be dropping . fast . Neil punch the igniter ... the rocket light and we hear the roar of 57,000 pound of thrust . neil ( into comm ) and I get a good lite and aw ... the word be literally leave behind and Neil 's thrown back into he seat as the rocket take off at a violent rate . Neil fight off 6 G 's , reach for the stick . neil ( into comm ) Roll . he tilt the stick slightly and the plane buck to the right , tossing Neil like a rag doll and taking our breath away . joe ( faint , comm ) good on track , 15 second . neil ( into comm ) pull up , I be indicate Mach 3 . Neil pull on the stick and rise sharply towards the heaven . he 's pressed into he seat and we see the plane 's blue nickel nose , glow cherry red from the heat . sweet Jesus . joe ( fainter , comm ) seem to be a tad steep . neil ( into comm ) okay , I be ... Neil 's eye tick to the altitude gauge , spinning up past 150,000 foot . he make a adjustment as the x-15 push through the horizon , blue sky now turning to black ... neil ( into comm ) I be indicate 5,800 , push over . yes , that 's Mach 5.8 , almost 4000 mph , and we feel every bit of it ... ' till we pass 170,000 foot and Neil cut the engine ... ..- jolting he against he harness ... and into microgravity . for a moment all be still . quiet . we hear a buzz over the radio , but it 's garble . Far away . neil ( into comm ) 190,000 foot , no radio reception , set instrument to record high altitude flight response . Neil punch a few button as a logbook float past he ... because we 're suborbital , high as the first mercury flight . so yeah , thing float . oh , and the view be pretty good too ... Neil look out , take in the earth stretch , curving away below the black sky . the star . the moon . neil ( into comm ) 207,000 foot . top view , look out , can see a awful long way . everything be quiet save for the low purr of the apus . Neil turn he attention to the g-limiter gauge as the X - 15 slowly fall back to earth , the altitude gauge start to spin ... the plane shake , but Neil stay focus on the g-limiter , creep towards 2.5 G 's . which be when we hear it ... a odd SOUND . a mechanical whine . it seem out of place . Neil ignore it as gravity take hold , pressing he forward against he seat strap . we hear garble buzz over comm . neil ( into comm ) still no radio . 150,000 foot , little shake in the yaw . again , armstrong understatement ... the plane shake violently as the altitude gauge spin down past 120,000 , the black sky fading back to blue as we fall back into the atmosphere . joe ( faint , comm ) okay , brake out , check the rcs off . wind whip over the plane . Neil reduce he angle of attack , still focus on the g-limiter , still ignore that odd whine . neil ( into comm ) rcs off , brake be out , G - joe ( comm ) limiter not quite at 5 G as. okay , 25 Â° stabilizer , hard deat turn . Neil pull on the stick , eye fix on the g-limiter , failing to notice the plane be not turn ... that the altitude gauge be holding at 115,000 feet . slowly , it begin to climb ... 116 , 117 , 118 ... the sky turn from blue to a chilling black . the shaking stop , the whipping wind fade to eerie silence . joe ( comm ) we show you balloon , not turn . the comm be drown out by the odd whine . Neil , fixated on the g-limiter , do not see the altitude gauge flipping up ... joe ( comm ) lot more leave there . Neil ! Joe 's voice cut through the whine , which fade . Neil blink , notice how quiet it be ... the plane have stop shaking . Neil 's eye tick from the black sky to the altitude gauge ... 120 , 121 , 122 ... shit . he realize he 's fuck up . neil ( into comm ) joe ( comm ) rog , I be read -- you be bounce off the atmosphere , hard leave ! Neil yank on the stick , eye darting from the dynamic pressure gauge to the vista sailing by below . neil ( into comm ) aerodynamic control not respond . unlike Joe , Neil remain calm ... but as we push in on he eye tick from gauge to gauge , we see the intensity , the focus . neil ( into comm ) switch over to reaction control . Neil drop the stick , grab the ballistic control . we hear a hiss as a burst of peroxide gas shoot out from the nose of the plane and Neil 's tossed back in he seat ... ... the plane 's nose flying up toward the sky , the horizon now above Neil 's head ; the black sky , the star , below he foot . and we realize ... neil flipped the X - 15 on its back , the nose be sticking straight up in the AIR ! holy shit !!! the canopy view be crazy , mountain above , sky below , the world upside down , but Neil keep he eye on the altitude gauge , inching up . 123 , 124 ... then holding at 125,000 feet . a beat ... then it begin to drop . 123 , 120 , 115 , 105 ... the sky once again fade to blue and we hear a slight wind under the plane . Neil 's eye tick from the altitude gauge to the dynamic pressure gauge ... neil ( into comm ) surface pressure rise , switch over to aerodynamic control . Neil reach for the stick ... but the atmosphere grab the plane , pulling it down on its back ! fuck ! Neil strain to hold on as he 's thrown around the cockpit with 9 g's of force ! the altitude gauge spin down at terrifying speed . 95 , 90 , 85 ... shit. Neil struggle , wrestling with the stick ... until he manage to flip the lifeless plane right - side up . Jesus . as Neil point the plane towards Edwards , the radio squawks -- joe ( comm ) Neil , can you give we a visual estimate of you location ? Neil scan the landscape , search for the desert runway as the plane dive like a brick towards the mountain ... neil ( into comm ) look like I be pretty ... in pretty bad shape for the south lake bed . joe ( comm ) okay , work the contingency for a landing from the south . Neil 's eye tick over the horizon , but he know what 's come -- joe ( comm ) Neil , there be no contingency . you need to get back to Rogers . Neil bear down , try to glide the engine - less plane farther than ever . yes , the X - 15 be built to land without power ... but generally , a pilot have a_lot more altitude to work with . the plane shimmy back and forth , wind howling at 300 knot . neil ( into comm ) I can see the base , runway 35 , it 'il have to be a straight in approach . his eye dart from the distant desert landing strip to the altitude gauge , drop 20,000 foot per minute . Neil flip he head bumper ... and smoke pour from the instrument panel . joe ( comm ) can we get a visual estimate ? the cockpit be filled with smoke ... neil ( into comm ) ... pretty hard to tell from here ... Neil hit a button . whoosh ! the plane dump peroxide and the smoke clear the cabin , but the view be hardly a relief ... neil ( into comm ) I be a little short than I think . Neil pull the stick to hold altitude , but he keep dropping . 9,000 ... 8500 ... 8000 foot ... fuck . it 's go to be close . we see butch 's b-52 swing up on Neil 's right . butch ( comm ) you ventral be still on ! Neil react , annoyed at himself . he hit the ventral button . the ventral fin blows off and the plane pitch forward ... Neil struggle with the stick ... 4000 , 3,500 , 3,000 foot ... butch ( comm ) start you flap down now ! Neil punch the flap . the plane buck up , reach towards the runway ... and now the odd mechanical whine return . push in on Neil , intensity burning as the whine crescendo ... 2,000 , 1,000 , 500 foot ... the plane hurtle past the edge of the brush , just clearing the joshua tree !!! butch ( comm ) you be in ! go head and put she down ! Neil pull up hard , flaring the plane , nose up , skid down ... the plane slam down with a bang . it skid roughly across the desert ... shaking violently ... and just as we think it might break into a million piece , Neil hit the back fin brake ... the plane go into a controlled slide ... kick up a huge cloud of dust ... and tossing neil across the cockpit ... until at last , the plane ease to a halt . for a moment , all be still . Silent . then Neil stir ... lean forward and take he helmet off . neil ( into comm ) I be down . butch ( comm ) joe ( comm ) Son of a bitch ! ( clearly relieved ) very nice , Neil . posse will get there shortly . as the dust clear and Neil look out towards the fire truck in the distance roll towards he , we CUT to -- ext . landing strip 35 , rogers dry lake bed , eafb - later a Air Force jeep wipe frame ... revealing edward afb FIRE truck , NASA pick ups and tech surround Neil 's X - 15 . the period car be cool , but we eye be draw to the x - 15 . it 's we first real look at the hypersonic rocket plane . the long fuselage , the thick dorsal wedge fin , the NASA signage ... it 's every bit as awesome as the flight we just witness . push in on the OPEN cockpit . NASA Engineers take reading off the instrument panel while Neil make note in he logbook . a beat , then Neil finish up and climb out of the cockpit . butch think you set a couple record . a familiar voice . ' butch 's butchart , 30 , flight gear , walk up with Neil 's boss , Joe Walker , 40 , thoughtful . butch grins . Neil nod stiffly as a tech with a map call out . 10 . tech butch , you mind walk I through the release data ? butch head off . Joe turn to Neil . joe you okay ? neil uh huh . I do not think anyone 's experience that kind of atmosphere bounce , we should try to replicate it in the sim -- joe Neil . neil yeah ? Joe look at he , concerned . but Neil 's not go there . a flight surgeon who 's be wait by the plane intercede . flight surgeon hey Joe , I gotta do he work up . Joe nod . Neil follow the surgeon off . Joe turn back to he jeep , only to find a grizzle AIR force colonel , late 30 . colonel yeager ( 0.c . ) kid 's a good engineer , but he 's not too good a airplane driver . bounce up in the thin air where you can not turn , it 's not too bright . joe he be focus on the g-limiter . it be a core flight objective . but it 's not clear Joe believe that . the Colonel 's tag glint in the sun . c. yeager . colonel yeager Three mishap in three month . it 's not my call , but I have ground he . yeager head out . as we hold on Joe , wonder if yeager 's right , we hear it again ... that odd mechanical whine ... the same unnerve sound Neil hear in the X - 15 . it take we to -- int . room , daniel FREEMAN memorial hospital - day close on a 2 - year- old girl ( karen ) . quiet , self -contain . 11 . pull back to see a cobalt radiation machine hulking over she . the source of the now familiar whine , it beam gamma ray into she brain as she lie on a gurney . hold for a awful beat ... then reverse to the observation window . Neil and he wife , janet , 27 . watch . int . observation room , memorial hospital - continuous Janet blink back tear , reach for Neil ... he take she hand , but he 's focus on the nearby instrument panel ... he ever alert eye ticking across the console as a tech adjust radiation level , set the dial ... 1.17 . 1.33 . Neil slip he hand out of Janet 's , pull out a logbook to jot down the number ... all while try to block out that SOUND . hold on Neil as the whine crescendoe . relentless . int . upstair hallway , armstrong cabin - night quiet . Janet on the floor outside Karen 's bedroom , she son , rick , 4 , asleep in she lap . in soft b/g , Neil sing softly to Karen , then kiss she forehead ... hold on Janet try to keep it together as Neil walk out . neil I ' 11l put he down . Janet nod . exhausted . Neil tousle she hair then gather Rick in he arm . as he carry Rick off , CUT to -- int . rick 's bedroom - moment later Neil tuck Rick in , methodically straighten the sheet . he spot a mess of a unfinish model plane on the desk . Neil compulsively move to tidy it up ... then pause . and sit ... ..- in the half light , he glue on a wing and gently blow it dry . the precision be calming . he have keep at it , but the doorbell ring . reluctantly , Neil stand and we CUT to -- int . foyer / kitchen , armstrong cabin - moment later Neil lead Joe Walker in . Joe carry in a casserole . neil can I offer you a beer ? joe sure. 12 . neil ( off the casserole ) that be not necessary . joe can not imagine Janet 's be up to much cooking . no. Neil hand Joe a beer . they drink . joe how 's Karen ? neil she 's do fine . Neil do not want to talk about it . a awkward beat . then -- joe Dick Day call from Houston , Bob gilruth be ask after you . neil for Gemini ? Joe nod . Neil 's eye tick to the NASA X - Press newsletter in a pile of mail on the table . NASA to Select more astronaut . joe I tell they it 's probably not the right time . neil Gemini and Apollo be speculative . we be up as high as the mercury flight , not sure why I have leave now . Joe clock the emotional denial , but do not comment on it . joe well . it â1ll be nice to keep you around . int . basement office , armstrong cabin - later that night a small space . a desk , some shelf . a light click on . Neil walk down the stair , over to the desk . he sit . we now see neatly stack medical book , mimeograph copy of scientific research paper . all mark and tabbed . Neil open a large computational notebook fill with tidy note . he write cobalt session no.2 ... then pull out he logbook . he transfer the radiation level . 1.17 . 1.33 . 13 . a beat . he add a new head . side Effects . Neil pause . then ... fatigue . dizziness . extreme headache . vomiting ( repeat ) . Hair loss / scalp irritation . loss of appetite . Neil stop write . he scan the list , then grab a stack of papers on cobalt therapy and tuck they into a manila folder that he place on a shelf . beside a dozen other folder . Neil take a breath , then reach for a dog-eare research paper from johns hopkins . pre- adolescent glioma of the pon : experimental treatment & therapies . it 's well-marked . Neil 's clearly read it achund time . yet he pick up a high - lighter and start to read . again . determine . off Neil , we prelap the chill sound of a mechanical crank -- ext . joshua memorial park - lancaster , CA - day close on a crank . turn . lower a small coffin . tight on Neil with Janet and they son , Rick . all in black . Janet and Rick cry as karen 's coffin sink . Neil do not . he 's impassive ... but he hug he family close . tight . the SOUND of the crank take we to -- int . live room , armstrong cabin - day a long push in over trays of food . Dark suit and dress . quiet murmur . no laughter or smile , no pleasant small talk . there be no pain like the loss of a child . we pass Joe and he wife , huddle with Janet . Neil 's by the window nearby . watch Rick toss a ball in the yard ... barely enduring the condolence , the soft pat on the back . just when it look like Neil might break , he slip away . winding through the crowd . towards the basement door . int . basement office , armstrong cabin - later that night the desk now a mess . marked up medical book and scattered papers . Neil 's notebook , now filled , lie open . we hear the door . Neil walk down the stair , move to the desk . his eye tick over book ... papers ... the notebook . a beat , then Neil close the notebook ... slowly pull together the paper and the book ... ... - and , up on a high shelf , carefully stack they all away . 14 . Neil 's eye tick over the empty desk . then he turn off the light . and exit . we hold on the shelf , then CUT to -- int . bedroom , armstrong house - early morning close on a westclox electric alarm clock , hour hand near six . a beat , then we pan over to Neil . stare up at the ceiling . Wide awake . the alarm trill . Neil turn it off as Janet stir . groggy , she roll over , reach for he . janet Neil ? but he 's already go . off Janet , alone ... int . test pilot office , NASA frc , edward afb - early morning Joe , butch and another pilot enter , coat and coffee . jawing , laugh ... until they spot Neil . work at he desk . the man pause , awkward . surprised to see he . butch ( cont âd ) pilot hey , Neil . Neil . neil hey . butch , you have time to talk through the data on the bounce ? butch ... sure , yeah , of course . lemme just put my thing down . butch and the other pilot head to they desk . Joe lean in . joe you can take a few day , you know . neil I know . Joe see he 's not go anywhere , start to head off when -- butch you gotta be kid I . butch clutches a xeroxed memo . he hold it up . a diagram of a strange , spider - like contraption , a cockpit on top . butch they want a free fly trainer to simulate a moon landing ... how the hell be we gonna do that ? 15 . joe I think that 's the question . butch they have not even figure out how to get to the moon . I be not waste time on impossible problem . butch toss the memo , exit . as Joe go after he , Neil glance at the memo , contemplate the challenge . his eye tick over the diagram , curious , absorb ... alive . a beat , then Neil reach for the memo and we smash to -- int . exam room one , ellington AIR force base , houston , TX - day close on a syringe pump water into a man' ear . astronaut selection , Project Gemini August 13 , 1962 the syringe empty . a tech dip it in a bucket of ice water , refill it and turn back to ... Neil . in he underwear . tech tell we when you want to stop . Neil eye a second tech with a stopwatch as the whoosh of ice water in he ear propel we into a series of short scene -- isolation room two tech walk Neil into the empty , windowless room . tech come out after two hour . they leave and close the door . the light flick off . it 's pitch black . Silent . a beat . then we hear Neil hum . neil Three hundred and sixty man in a board house bed , roll over , roll over . one turn over and the other man say , roll over , roll over ... interview room a stack of ' test ' be drop on a desk in front of Neil . he eye the first test . for each of the pair statement below , select the statement that best fit you personality . Neil dig in : ( 1 ) I worry a lot about thing in the future that could go wrong ; ( 2 ) it take a lot for I to get angry . 16 . a beat . Neil circle number two and move on ... exam room two a foot plunge into a ice bath . tech take it out when it 's too cold . a tech start a stopwatch , watch Neil . who settles in . isolation room ( pitch black ) we see nothing , hear nothing ... but Neil . neil two hundred three man in a board house bed , roll over , roll over ... exam room one more ice water shoot into Neil 's ear . the tech nearby glance at he stopwatch . Neil 's jaw set . interview room a last pair : ( 1 ) I like to help friend when they be in trouble ; ( 2 ) I like to do my best in whatever I undertake . Neil read , think and circle number two . then he put the test aside and reach for the next one . draw a picture of yourself . a beat . as Neil start to draw -- exam room two Neil 's foot in a ice-bath . turn white . the tech with the stopwatch jot down a note . Neil do not move . interview room Neil finish a fairly generic stick figure draw of himself . he turn the page . draw a picture of you family . Neil harden . as he stare at the blank page , we CUT to -- isolation room ( pitch black ) neil .-- but in the struggle , he neck get break , roll over , roll ... Neil trail off . a long beat . we feel he struggling . then , just when we think he might to break ... 17 . neil eighty nine man in a board house bed , roll over , roll over ... exam room two Neil 's foot in a ice bath . now blue . Neil bear down . neil ( 0.c. ) ...he turn over and no one say roll over , roll over ... exam room one whoosh ... the tech unload another syringe into Neil 's ear . push in on Neil , blank , numb . and as we go tight on he eye , we see it again . the pain there . the deep , deep pain . neil ( 0.c . ) the last man think it would be a great joke , to keep on roll when ... int . isolation room ( pitch black ) neil ( 0.c. ) ... not a soul speak , but he fall on the floor and he neck get break , roll over , roll over . Neil bang on the door . it open , the light jarring . Neil blink , then walk out . he follow a tech down the hall ... but we hold on a man in a tie and shirtsleeve . meet deke slayton , 37 , slightly gray , macho back when that be appeal . deke turn to the tech with the stopwatch . deke slayton how long ? the tech show deke the watch . 2:03 . int . hallway , office build , ellington afb - later the hall line with chair , candidate read project gemini briefing book . find Neil look for a seat ... when pete conrad , 32 , a wick witted wasp from Princeton call out . pete conrad Air Force ? navy ? ... leatherneck ? Neil look at he , blank . ed white Christ , another egghead . 18 . Pete smirk , trade a look with ed white , 32 , a lanky Texan with easy - go charm . but Neil do not engage . instead , he head to the end of the hall , find a seat and open a packet . elliot see civilian ? Neil glance at elliot see , 35 , a flight test engineer from ucla , older than the rest . and more cerebral . Neil nod . elliot see I too . elliot see . neil Neil armstrong . Neil turn to he packet , but elliot , anxious , keep talk . elliot see tough morning , huh ? I barely last two minute in the ice bath . I see one of the military guy keep he foot in so long it turn blue . neil I think NASA 's more interested in psychological reaction than physiological performance . elliot see I just figure he probably do not do so well on the intelligence test . this draw a smile , maybe the first we have see from Neil . a SMALL connection . which for Neil be no little thing . deke armstrong . Neil look up . deke stand by the door at the end of the hall , a candidate slip out behind he . Neil stand . elliot see good luck . int . conference room , ellington afb - moment later a empty chair in front of a panel of men , include Bob gilruth , 48 , who 's voice we hear earlier . in person , gilruth be tall , hawkish and as commanding as he sound at the top . deke lead Neil in , introduce he . 19 . deke gentlemen , Neil armstrong . Neil , you know Bob gilruth , head of the manned Space Center ; Chris kraft , we flight director ; and we ask John Glenn to sit in . I figure you watch he flight with the rest of the country . if Neil 's impressed he do not show it . he shake hand with gilruth ; CHRIS kraft , 37 , look like a 5as ad rep ; and JOHN glenn , 40 , clean cut , very much the american hero . Glenn smile as Neil sit in front of the panel . JOHN glenn deke say you fly for the navy in Korea . panther , right ? neil yes , sir . yes , Neil be a navy combat pilot . and if you be surprised he do not mention that in the hall , you be not pay attention . JOHN glenn good lateral control , but pretty stiff in pitch , be I right ? neil never bother I much . JOHN glenn ( laugh ) well , I do not fly as many mission as you . but I bet I take more flak . Glenn warm , smile ; Neil do not . awkward . gilruth jump in . gilruth Neil , we have be chat with candidate about the program so we can get a idea of how everyone think . now , as I be sure you know , we decision to forego direct ascent in favor of lunar - orbit rendezvous have have a major impact on Gemini . CHRIS kraft do you have any thought on that decision , Neil ? neil I think it be a good decision . 20 . a awkward pause . a beat . the JOHN glenn would you care to elaborate on that ? neil even take von braun 's initial criticism into account , the payload save by parking the primary vehicle in lunar orbit seem well worth the result challenge . kraft what do you see as the challenge ? neil ( consider ) cislunar navigation for one . you be aim for a narrower target , insert a craft into lunar orbit . of course , you have also need to design the smaller lunar excursion ship and figure out how to land it . panel wait . deke prompt Neil . deke be that all , Neil ? neil .-- well , the most difficult hurdle would be rendezvous and docking . but that 's only assume you want to get the man back . be he serious ? a beat , then Glenn laugh . the room follow suit , laugh hard , assume Neil be joke . of course , it 's not clear that he be . deke do anyone have anything else ? gilruth yes . Neil , I be very sorry to hear about you daughter . Neil nod , impassive . neil what 's the question ? gilruth well ... how 's you wife ? 21 . neil I think she 's handle it well . off gilruth , satisfied with Neil 's answer , we smash to -- int . armstrong cabin - night Neil , Jan and Rick eat supper . deathly quiet , a pallor hang . rick can I go play outside ? janet just stay in the backyard where we can see you . Rick scurries off . Neil barely notice . a painful beat ... it 's a relief when the phone ring . Janet get up , answer . janet ( into phone ) hello ? yes , one second . Neil ? Neil look up .
