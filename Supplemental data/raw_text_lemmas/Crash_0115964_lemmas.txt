James Dean be on he way to a automobile race in salinas , a dusty town in northern California . the two would only meet for one moment , but it be a moment that would create a Hollywood legend . at this point vaughan , who be dress in light - blue cotton 1950s mechanic ' overall , see James and helen in the thin crowd and wave to they , as though they be long -stand aficionado of crash spectacle . he do not wait to see if they react , but immediately step into the passenger side of the porsche , microphone still in hand . vaughan ( over speaker ) you will notice that we be not wear helmet or safety pad of any kind , and we car be not equip with roll cage or seat-belt . we depend solely on the skill of we driver for we safety , so that we can bring you the ultimate in authenticity . all right , here we go . the fatal crash of James Dean ! vaughan hand the microphone to a still cameraman who also function as a assistant , and then sink down into the silver car . seagrave start the porsche , which settles quickly into a husky idle . a few blip of the throttle , and then the porsche be reverse down to the edge of the light strip of road . when the porsche stop , the excited crowd go quiet . a assistant with a walkie-talkie kneel beside the silver car on the driver 's side , co-ordinate the start with he opposite number stand next to the Ford over the hill . there be a calculate pause before anything happen , and then the porsche spin its wheel and accelerate up the hill . from they vantage point in the stand , James and helen can clearly see that the Ford have also start and that the two car be head toward each other , each in its respective lane . the porsche accelerate hard , the Ford lumber along at a moderate pace , sway clumsily on its soft spring . as the car approach each other , James notice a fresh clear at the side of the road at just about the point where they seem likely to pass . sure enough , when the car be about thirty yard apart , the Ford wander over the center line . as the porsche approach it , it seem to move back into its own lane , but then suddenly swerve again as though make a leave turn . the porsche , in its turn , swerve to avoid the big american car but they collide , the immense chrome grill punch into the side of the fragile race car , crumpling it like a wad of tin foil and shunting it unceremoniously off the road into the clear that have be prepare for it . as the porsche hobble to a stop , vaughan seem to stand up on he seat and then throw himself out of the car , roll over what 's leave of the front hood on to the ground . seagrave remain slump in the driver 's seat . vaughan lie still where he land , a few foot ahead of the crumpled nose of the race car . the door of the Ford open and trask stumble out . he begin to walk around in a daze and agitate manner , and the crowd , which have be buzzing , go silent again . trask walk away from the crash site and disappear into the shadow at the edge of the road . ext . country road . grandstand -- night there be no movement from either seagrave or vaughan . James be not sure how to react , but helen seem genuinely worried . jame be that part of the act or be they really hurt ? helen I do not know . you can never be sure with vaughan . this be he show . a still cameraman run out of nowhere and kneel beside the apparently stricken vaughan in the weed at the side of the road . it be not clear whether he be take he picture or minister to he . it soon become clear that he have hand he a radio microphone because vaughan 's low , melodramatic growl now ripple out of the wood from the tree speaker . vaughan ( over speaker ) rolf w√ºtherich be throw from the porsche and spend a year in the hospital recover from he injury . Donald turnupseed be find wander around in a daze , basically unhurt . James Dean die of a break neck and become immortal . ext . country road -- night vaughan now leap to he foot , hand raise in triumph . seagrave stir behind the wheel , then raise he hand . trask emerge from the wood , wave to the now - supercharged crowd . seagrave try to get out of the collapse porsche but be jamme behind the wheel . without miss a beat , vaughan dance over to the car and begin to haul seagrave out of he seat . colin hold I .

Internal politics . it 's a joke . they have no idea who we really be . in the gather darkness of the wood , it be apparent that James do not really know who they be either . int . vaughan' lincoln -- night vaughan drive the lincoln through a scar , bleak landscape . in the front seat with he be helen and James . seagrave be lie down in the back seat with he eye close . vaughan that be glib , be not it ? ' James Dean die of a break neck and become immortal . ' but I could not resist . vaughan put he hand between helen 's thigh . she seem not to notice , but she eye close dreamily every once in a while . James watch microscopically . sometimes , when the flow of traffic allow , vaughan stare intently at James while he hand work away between helen 's thigh , and James look away , flushed , like a schoolgirl . ext . seagrave's garage -- night the lincoln turn into the forecourt of seagrave 's garage and showroom . his business , which have clearly see better day , be hot-rodd and customize car . behind the unwash glass of the showroom be a fiberglass replica of a 1930s brookland racer , fade bunt stuff into the seat . they get out of the car , help the woozy seagrave through the door at the side of the showroom , which lead to the stairway up to the apartment above the garage . int . seagrave apt . -- night the seagrave apartment be dirty and depress , feature cheap , cigarette -scarre leatherette furniture . James watch helen and vaughan steer seagrave into the live - room , where two people sit on a couch watch television with the sound turn off : gabrielle , a sharp - face young woman who be roll a hash joint ; and seagrave 's wife , Vera , a handsome , restless woman of about thirty . Vera stand as they come in and rush over to the shaky seagrave . vera oh , God . what happen ? here , lie down . Vera and helen lay the confuse seagrave down on the three - seat sofa , while vaughan sit next to gabrielle and help she prepare another hash joint . James , awkwardly leave stand , notice long scar on Vera 's thigh and leg . helen they do the James Dean crash . it seem to go perfectly . but he start to feel nauseous on the way back . I be sure it 's concussion . vera ah , well ... we be familiar enough with that , then , be not we ? James watch gabrielle and vaughan . as she roll a small piece of resin in a twist of silver foil , vaughan bring a brass lighter out of he hip pocket . gabrielle cook the resin , and shake the powder into the open cigarette wait in the roller machine on she lap . on gabrielle 's leg be trace of what seem to be gas bacillus scar , faint circular depression on the kneecap . she notice James stare at she scar , but make no effort to close she leg . on the sofa beside she be a chromium metal cane and , as she shift she weight , James see that the instep of each leg be hold in the steel clamp of a surgical support . it now become obvious from the over-rigid posture of she waist that she be also wear a back - brace of some kind . gabrielle roll another cigarette out of the machine , but do not offer it to James . instead , vaughan get up and take it over to seagrave , who have manage to sit up . vaughan I would really like to work out the detail of the jayne mansfield crash with you . we could do the decapitation -- she head embed in the windshield -- and the little dead dog thing as well . you know , the chihuahua in the back seat . I have get it figure out . seagrave take the light joint and draw heavily on it . he hold the smoke in he lung for a while , study the grease on he hand before he answer . colin you know I will be ready , vaughan . but I will want to wear really big tit -- out to here -- so the crowd can see they get cut up and crush on the dashboard . James turn to go , leave helen to she conversation with Vera , but vaughan follow he through the door , hold he arm in a powerful grip . vaughan do not leave yet , ballard . I want you to help I . int . vaughan' workshop -- night James follow vaughan down a cramped corridor to a photographic workshop form out of a warren of small room . vaughan ease James into the first room and then carefully close the door behind they . jame do you live here ? with seagrave ? vaughan ( laugh ) I live in my car . this be my workshop . pin to the wall and lie on the bench among the enamel pail be hundred of photograph . the floor around the enlarger be litter with half - plate print , develop and cast aside once they have yield they image . vaughan make a sweeping gesture that take in all the photograph . vaughan and this be the new project , ballard . as vaughan hunt around the central table , turn the page of a leather - bound album , James look down at the discard print below he foot . most of they be crude frontal picture of motor- car and heavy vehicle involved in highway collision , surround by spectator and police , and close - up of impact radiator grill and windshield . vaughan open the album at random and hand it to James . he lean back against the door and watch as James adjust the desk lamp . the first thirty page record the crash , hospitalization , and post-recuperative romance of the young woman gabrielle -- a social worker , the photo suggest -- who be currently get very stone in the next room . by coincidence , she small sport car have collide with a airline bus at the entry to the airport not far from the site of James 's own accident . vaughan have obviously be there , shoot film , moment after the crash . the incredibly detailed photo end with she affair with she physical therapy instructor . the remainder of the album describe the course of James 's own accident and recovery , and include he sexual encounter with Renata , helen remington , and he own wife , Catherine . vaughan stand at James 's shoulder , like a instructor ready to help a promise pupil . James close the book . jame what kind of help can I possibly be to you ? you seem to be everywhere at once as it be . at that moment , there be a knock at the door , and then gabrielle enter and take a few stiff step into the room on she shackle leg . she hold out a couple of joint to vaughan . gabrielle think you might be miss this . ( to James ) so here you be at the nerve centre . vaughan make everything look like a crime , do not he ? vaughan take the joint and light they both . he hand one to James , who take it gratefully . jame what exactly be you project , vaughan ? a book of crash ? a medical study ? a sensational documentary ? Global traffic ? vaughan it 's something we be all intimately involved in : the reshaping of the human body by modern technology . int . film studio . james' office -- day James watch Renata and Catherine talk animatedly at the other end of he office . he can not hear what they be say , but Renata be show Catherine layout of ad involve image of private plane fly in formation . they touch each other from time to time without seem to notice it , but James notice it . ext . various large CITY road -- day James and Catherine set off for home in they own separate car . at time , they be within sight of each other and James watch she microscopically , as though he do not know she , as though , perhaps , she be not human . at one point he see she with she hand rest on the steering wheel , she right index finger pick at a old adhesive label on the windshield . and then , abruptly , James be aware of the dent fender of vaughan 's lincoln only a few foot behind Catherine 's sport car . vaughan now surge past James , crowd along the roadway as if wait for Catherine to make a mistake . startle , Catherine take refuge in front of a airline bus in the nearside lane . vaughan drive alongside the bus , use he horn and light to force the driver back , and again cut in behind Catherine . James move ahead along the center lane , shouting to vaughan as he pass he , but vaughan be signal to Catherine , pump he headlight at she rear fender . without think , Catherine pull into the courtyard of a fill station , force vaughan into a heavy U -turn . tire scream , he swing around the ornamental flower - bed with its glaze pottery plant , but James block he way with he own car . heart racing , Catherine sit still in she car among the fuel pump , she eye flash at vaughan . James step from he car and walk across to vaughan , who watch James approach as if he have never see he before , scar mouth work on a piece of gum as he gaze at the aircraft take off from the airport . jame vaughan , what the hell be you do ? be you try to create you own famous crash ? vaughan hook he gear lever into reverse . vaughan it excited she , ballard . you wife , Catherine . she enjoy it . ask she . vaughan reverse he car in a wide circle , almost run down a pass pump attendant , and set off across the early afternoon traffic . int . ballard apt . -- night James and Catherine lie naked in bed , she with she back to he , buttock press into he groin . he be inside she . catherine he must have fuck a lot of woman in that huge car of he . it 's like a bed on wheel . it must smell of semen ... jame it do . catherine do you find he attractive ? jame he 's very pale . cover with scar . catherine would you like to fuck he , though ? in that car ? jame no . but when he 's in that car ... catherine have you see he penis ? jame I think it 's badly scar too . from a motorcycle accident . catherine be he circumcise ? can you imagine what he anus be like ? describe it to I . would you like to sodomize he ? would you like to put you penis right into he anus , thrust it up he anus ? tell I , describe it to I . tell I what you would do . how would you kiss he in that car ? describe how you would reach over and unzip he greasy jeans , then take out he penis . would you kiss it or suck it right away ? which hand would you hold it in ? have you ever suck a penis ? do you know what semen taste like ? have you ever taste semen ? some semen be saltier than other . vaughan 's semen must be very salty ... they both have huge orgasm within moment of each other . int . helen' car -- day we be close on the distract , solicitous face of helen remington . helen have you come ? helen remington and James be have sex in the back seat of helen 's car , helen sit on James 's lap with she back to he . she dismount he and touch he shoulder with a uncertain hand , as though he be a patient she have work hard to revive . ext . airport car - park -- day helen 's car be park on the upper level of the airport car - park , which be currently quite busy . stream of traffic , both pedestrian and vehicular , flow past the car . int . helen' car -- day James lie against the rear seat of the car while helen dress with abrupt movement , straighten she shirt around she hip like a department - store window - dresser jerk a garment on to a mannequin . jame please finish you story . helen the junior pathologist at ashford Hospital . then the husband of a colleague of mine , then a trainee radiologist , then the service manager at my garage . jame and you have sex with all of this man in car ? only in car ? helen yes . I do not plan it that way . jame and do you fantasize that vaughan be photograph all this sex act ? as though they be traffic accident ? helen yes. ( laugh ) they feel like traffic accident . int . road research lab -- day we be witness a spectacular road accident re-create under laboratory condition in the immense confines of the Road Research Lab . a motorcycle be in the process of have a head - on collision with a sedan bear a family of four -- a extremely violent and disturbing crash , despite the use of cradle , dummy , rail , cable and extensive metering and recording technology . among the many witness to the crash , include numerous engineer , technician and Transport Ministry official , be James , helen and vaughan . vaughan be energetically masturbate through he jeans , shield by a sheaf of publicity folder which he hold in he other hand . there be a terrific metallic explosion as the motorcycle strike the front of the sedan . the two vehicle veer sideways towards the line of startle spectator . the motorcyclist and he bike sail over the hood of the car and strike the windshield , then careen across the roof in a black mass of fragment . the car plunge ten foot back on its hawser and come to rest astride its rail . the hood , windshield and roof have be crush by the impact . Inside the cabin , the lopsided family lurch across each other , the decapitate torso of the front - seat woman passenger embed in the fracture windshield . the engineer wave to the crowd reassuringly and move toward the motorcycle , which lie on its side fifty yard behind the car . but it be vaughan -- a black - jackete figure stride on long , uneven leg -- who arrive first at the bike . for a moment it seem that he might try to lift it up himself , but he then back away to where technician be pick up piece of the motorcyclist 's body , and then turn away completely and rejoin helen and James . vaughan hold up the bundle of technical hand - out in he grip . vaughan get all the paper you can , ballard . some of the stuff they be give away be terrific : ' mechanism of occupant ejection ' , ' tolerance of the human face in crash Impacts ' ... helen take James 's arm , smile at he , nodd encouragingly , as if urging a child across some mental hurdle . helen we can have a look at it again on the monitor . they be show it in slow motion . a audience of thirty or so gather at the trestle table to watch a slowmotion replay on a huge television monitor . as the hypnotic , grotesque ballet unfold , the crowd 's own ghostly image stand silently in the background , hand and face unmove while the collision be re-enacted . the dream - like reversal of role make they seem less real than the mannequin in the car . James look down at the silk -suite wife of a Ministry official stand beside he . her eye watch the film with a rapt gaze , as if she be see herself and she daughter dismember in the crash . int . vaughan' car -- night James ride in vaughan 's car . vaughan drive aggressively , roll the heavy car along the access road , hold the batter bumper a few foot behind any smaller vehicle until it move out of the way . vaughan I have always want to drive a crash car . jame you could get you wish at any moment . vaughan no , I mean a crash with a history . camus 's facel vega , or Nathaniel West 's station wagon , Grace Kelly 's Rover 3500 . fix it just enough to get it roll . do not clean it , do not touch anything else . jame be that why you drive this car ? I take it that you see Kennedy 's assassination as a special kind of car crash ? vaughan the case could be make . they approach a major intersection . for almost the first time on this drive , vaughan apply the brake . the heavy car sway and go into a long right -hand slide which carry it across the path of a taxi . floor the accelerator , vaughan swerve in front of it , tire scream over the blaring horn of the taxi . as they settle down , vaughan reach behind he and lift a briefcase off the back seat . vaughan take a look at this and tell I what you think . James open the briefcase and slide out a thick packet of glossy photograph , all of they mark up with coloured ink pen . the photo be cull from a variety of source -- newspaper , magazine , video still , film frame -- blow up to uniform 8 ' x 10 ' size . each one depict a famous crash victim in the prime of life , and each one have the wound to come mark up very explicitly -- line circle they neck and pubic area , breast and cheekbone shade in , section line across they mouth and abdomen . handwritten note complement the circle and arrow . a second packet of photograph show the car in which this famous people die . each photo be mark to show which part of the car destroy or fuse with which famous body part : for example , a close - up of the dashboard and windshield from the camus car -- Michel gallimard 's facel vega -- be mark ' nasal bridge ' , ' soft palate ' , ' leave zygomatic arch ' . jame it 's very ... satisfy . I be not sure I understand why . vaughan it 's the future , ballard , and you be already part of it . for the first time , a benevolent psychopathology beckon towards we . for example , the car crash be a fertilize rather than a destructive event -- a liberation of sexual energy that mediate the sexuality of that who have die with a intensity impossible in any other form . to fully understand that , and to live that ... that be my project . jame what about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology ? I think that be you project . vaughan a crude sci-fi concept that float on the surface and do not threaten anybody . I use it to test the resilience of my potential partner in psychopathology . the traffic have jamme up to a walk pace . use he horn , vaughan force the driver in the slower lane to back up and let he across on to the hard shoulder . once free , he accelerate past the line of traffic , occasionally scraping the right flank of the lincoln against the cement divider . in the distance the airport car-park loom . int . airport car - park -- day the lincoln spiral its way up toward the upper level of the airport carpark . James just spot a sharp - face young woman in a very short skirt , a airport whore , provocatively bent over a railing ostensibly to watch airplane land and take off , when vaughan slam on the brake and jump out of the car . vaughan you drive . the startle James numbly obey , slide over into the driver 's seat as vaughan approach the whore and begin to negotiate with she . James gingerly maneuver the boat-like car to one side to allow traffic to pass as vaughan return with the gum -chew whore in tow . as the girl , with short black hair and a boy 's narrow - hipped body , open the passenger door , vaughan hand she a joint and light it for she . then , lift she chin , he put he finger in she mouth and pluck out the knot of gum , flick it away into the darkness . vaughan let 's get rid of that . I do not want you blow it up my urethra . ext . airport road -- night James drive the lincoln along the bizarrely light road that ring the airport . vaughan and the whore be in the back seat . int . lincoln -- night James adjust the rear-view mirror so that he can see into the rear seat . vaughan be have strange , disconnect sex with the whore . James realize that he can almost control the sexual act behind he by the way in which he drive the car . it be , in that sense , a sexual threesome -- or , more properly , a foursome , because the sex between vaughan and the whore take place in the hood grottoe of the luminescent dial , surging needle and blink light of the black , brood lincoln . int . film studio . james' office -- day James and Renata sort through some storyboard together at the architect 's table . Renata take a few cast - off and walk past the window toward the filing cabinet . she take a quick peek out the window on she way . renata you friend 's still out there . James leave the table and look out the window . vaughan be sit in he car in the center of the parking - lot . most of the staff be leave for home , take they car one by one from the slot around vaughan 's dusty limousine . renata what do he want from you ? jame hard to say . renata I be go to leave now . do you want a lift ? jame no , thanks . I will go with vaughan . ext . film studio . parking - lot -- dusk James walk out into the nearly desert parking - lot to find two car park in front of vaughan 's lincoln : a police patrol car and Catherine 's white sport car . one policeman be inspect the lincoln , peer through the dusty window , with vaughan fidget beside he . the other stand beside Catherine 's car , question she . James slow guiltily as both policeman begin to talk to vaughan . Catherine spot James and walk crisply over to he . catherine they be question vaughan about a accident near the airport . some pedestrian ... they think he be run over intentionally . jame vaughan be not interested in pedestrian . as if take they cue from this , the policeman walk back to they car . vaughan watch they go , head raise like a periscope . catherine you would better drive he . he 's a bit shaky . I will follow in my car . where be yours ? jame at home . I could not face all this traffic . catherine I would better come with you , then . be you sure you can drive ? as Catherine and James walk toward vaughan , he reach into the rear seat of he car and pull out a white sweatshirt . as he take off he denim jacket , the fall light pick out the scar on he naked abdomen and chest , a constellation of white chip that circle he body from the leave armpit down to he crotch . ext . jammed motorway -- night the lincoln have enter a immense traffic jam , and brake - light flare in the evening air . vaughan sit with one arm out the passenger window . he slap the door impatiently , pound the panel with he fist . a police car speed down the descent lane of a flyover , headlight and roof-lamp flash . ahead , two policeman steer the traffic from the nearside curb . warning tripod set up on the pavement flash a rhythmic ' slow ... slow ... Accident ... Accident ... ' eventually , they begin to edge past the accident site , which be light by a circle of police spotlight . Three vehicle -- a taxi , a limousine and a small sport sedan -- have collide where a on-ramp join the main roadway . a crowd have gather on the sidewalk and on the pedestrian bridge that span the road . beside the taxi , its three passenger lie in a group , blanket swathing they chest and leg . first -aid man work on the driver , a elderly man who sit upright against the fender of he car , face and clothes speckle with drop of blood . the limousine 's passenger still sit in the deep cabin of they car , they identity seal behind the star internal window . int . vaughan' car -- night Catherine have half hide herself behind the passenger seat . her steady eye follow the skid mark and loop of bloodstain oil that cross the familiar macadam like a battle diagram . vaughan , by contrast , lean out the window , both arm ready as if about to seize one of the body . in some recess in the back seat he have find a camera , which now swing from he neck . sire whining , a third ambulance drive down the oncoming lane . a police motorcyclist cut in front of James and slow to a halt , signal he to wait and allow the ambulance to pass . James stop the car . ten yard from they be the crush limousine , the body of the young chauffeur still lie on the ground beside it . Three engineer work with surreal hand - tool and hydraulic cut and pry equipment at the rear door of the limousine . they sever the jamme door mechanism and pull back the door to expose the passenger trap inside the compartment . the two passenger , a pink -face man in he fifty wear a black overcoat , and a young woman with a pale , anemic skin , still sit upright , stare blankly , in the rear seat . a policeman pull away the travel rug that cover they leg and waist . the woman 's leg be bare , the older man 's foot splay , apparently break at the ankle . the woman 's skirt have ride up around she waist , and she leave hand hold the window strap . as the older man turn to the woman , one hand search for she , he slip sideways off the seat , he ankle kick at the clutter of leather valise and break glass . the traffic stream move on . James ease the car forward . vaughan raise the camera to he eye , lowering it from sight when a ambulance attendant try to knock it from he hand . the pedestrian bridge pass overhead . half out of the car , vaughan peer at the score of leg press against the metal railing , then open the door and dive out . ext . motorway verge -- night as James pull the lincoln on to the verge , vaughan run back to the pedestrian bridge , darting in and out of the car . James and Catherine get out of the car . as James close the door , he notice that the blood of one of the accident victim have somehow be splash on to the door handle , and that some of it be now on he hand . he find a section of newspaper at the side of the road and wipe the blood off he hand . when he look up , he realize that Catherine have follow vaughan back to the accident site . ext . jammed motorway -- night James walk back alone , eventually spot they among the throng of spectator , Catherine watch vaughan 's scar face intently , provocatively , as he photograph every aspect of the accident . there be a calmly festive and pervasive sexuality in the air among the onlooker , and even a congregational feel as one group of engineer work on the crush sport sedan , pry at the metal roof which have be flatten on to the head of the occupant . and now vaughan pose a only slightly reluctant Catherine against the backdrop of the stricken taxi as though she be one of the shake survivor of the accident . when the roof of the sport sedan be lever up , the hair of the driver , its only passenger , come off with it as though scalp , stick to the roofliner with drying blood . but it 's soon apparent that it 's not hair , but rather a cheap , tangle , platinum blond wig . vaughan make he way over to the sedan , intrigue by the dangle ' scalp ' , which be almost phosphorescent in the road - rescue work light . Catherine trail obediently behind he , like a harshly discipline puppy . when the body of the driver be expose to the light , the effect be doubly grotesque , for not only be the driver dead and partially crush , but he be also a cross-dresser : seagrave , in jayne mansfield drag . his long , greasy hair be tie up in a knot on he head , he be unshaven , he huge , fake bosom be bloody and askew ; he bloat , muscular body strain against the pink 60 skirt and jacket , the blue suede boot with high heel . there be also a dead Chihuahua bitch inside the car with seagrave , which vaughan manage to move with he foot until a cop , outrage , shoos he away . the dog be stiff with rigor mortis , obviously dead long before the crash . a excited vaughan have spot James and now approach he , breathless . vaughan it 's seagrave . he be worried that we would never do jayne mansfield 's crash , now that the police be crack down . so he do it himself . vaughan turn back to look at the wreck again , almost reverent . this be seagrave 's own solitary work of art . vaughan ( shake he head ) the dog -- God , the dog be brilliant , perfect . I wonder where he get it ? now vaughan turn to James , he face flushed , incandescent with joy . vaughan come with I , James .
