the last flight written by John monk saunder fade in ext . battlefield - night on a freeze frame of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal no - man 's land , surround by tree and overhange branch . the distant roar of battle rumble ominously . superimposed title appear and hold for a moment . abruptly , the image spring to life . the gun fire deafeningly . the nearby branch shake violently . another set of title appear . the image freeze again as a lone bugle play a charge . again and again and again , the image move , the gun discharge noisily , the image freeze and more set of title appear with every firing . on the last discharge , the trumpet fade and all hell break loose : war montage nothing but fast , brutal flash cut of : cannon fire in all direction . massive explosion on the battlefield that light up the night . troops march across a bridge as a shell hit the river below send water tower into the sky . a entire cavalry division gallop hard over the battlefield , blaze mortar fire visible above they on the horizon . brief shot of the horse , they grim rider hang on for dear life , they muscle flex , hoof pound the dirt .

Francis seem to have suffer the great toll psychologically . a narcoleptic , strangely detach and unemotional much of the time , always on the verge of doze off , he speech slur even when he be not drunk . only the athlete of the group , Bill -- a burly Texan whose full name be William Talbot -- be in outstanding physical shape . but he be reckless , restless , and temperamental , cover up unnamed insecurity with bravado and force exuberance . cary how ' bout a cocktail ? shep not a bad idea at that . as a group , they turn and head into a nearby building . brief dissolve to : a glowing sign make of light bulb , outside the building . it spell out claridge's -- a popular parisian drink establishment for anglo -american . dissolve to : int . claridge be - night numerous shelf hold numerous bottle of liquor . employee in white jacket hurriedly rush in and pull down a few bottle . dissolve to : int . claridge's bar - lengthy panning shot the place be pack with well - dress man and woman . the bar be crowded with man ( and man only , for no woman be allow to sit at claridge 's bar ) smoking , drink , converse . at the end of the pan , we discover we heroes enter , greet by a employee who take they hat . another view - near the bar a attractive young woman with a wide , vacant stare stand against a wall opposite the bar hold a champagne glass in she hand . her name be nikki and she seem to be in a world all to herself . we four handsome heroes file past she , intent on find a table . only cary pay any attention to nikki . after they have all pass she , he pause to turn and stare . she 's extremely nearsight and do not notice he . he look at the glass in she hand , puzzle . he start off but then pause . after a second uncertain look , he move off to join he friend who stand together and peer around the crowded room , unable to find a place to sit . cary keep look at nikki . he glance at the other and they follow he gaze : nikki still wear a blank expression , clutches the glass in two hand . the glass in she hand . between she finger , we glimpse its content -- a complete set of man 's false tooth . we pull back to discover that cary have approach she . he 's stand right next to she and be stare at the glass . she finally notice he . cary I beg you pardon . but , if I be not too inquisitive , would you mind tell I what be that you be drink ? nikki teeth . cary teeth ? after another look , cary turn to he friend . cary hey , it 's tooth ! bill ( o.s. ) teeth ?!
