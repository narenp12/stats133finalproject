fade in : int . DC - 10 airliner - night jacob johnson be sleep . it do not look like a pleasant experience . he be sixteen , dirty blonde , he eye visibly move under close lid as he sit huddle under a blanket in he window seat . the light be dim -- the shade on the window close -- a bead of sweat dribble down he forehead . the humming of the jet 's engine vibrate through the cabin . the boy 's eye snap open . Jacob glance around nervously . he look like a escape convict who just accidentally walk into the policeman 's Ball . a greyhaired man two seat away from he give the teenager a cursory glance , then go back to he book . Jacob lay he head back and try to relax . the engine continue to drine . until a new noise start . a whooshing noise . the sound be very faint . but distinct from everything else . Jacob frown . the noise get louder . Jacob 's sure he 's hearing it now . he look at the greyhaire man . the man catch he eye and the two of they stare at each other for a heartbeat - then Jacob turn away . the man return to he book . and Jacob immediately turn back to he . jacob do you hear that ? the man give he a annoyed look as the whooshing get louder . greyhaired man hear what ? jacob that noise . greyhaired man I do not hear anything . the man turn back to the book as the sound get even louder - - like it 's come closer . Jacob squirm in he seat -- sneak a look at the man again . how can he not hear that ? a stewardess walk by and Jacob catch she attention . jacob Excuse I . stewardess yes ? the whooshing be completely obvious now . the greyhaire man try to ignore the two people talk over he . jacob what be that sound ? stewardess that 's just the engine , sir . jacob no , it 's different . it 's not the engine . it 's get louder . the man sigh -- the stewardess smile patronizingly . stewardess we be just gain altitude to get above some rough weather . that 's the sound of the engine speed up a bit . everything 's fine . jacob um...okay . the stewardess walk away as Jacob sit back and start to bite he nail . the whoosh be really start to blare now . he look between the seat in front of he -- twist around to look behind . he snap back to the greyhaire man . jacob ( cont would ) can not you hear that ? greyhaired man ( lose patience ) look , kid . will you relax ? it 's just the damn engine , okay ? the man glare at he , and Jacob back off . the sound have grow deafening . Jacob grind he seat like he 's go mad . he look at the close window . he reach out he hand , grab the handle then rip up the shade for all to see : a 747 come right at US . Jacob scream . the plane crash . Impact - decompression - explosion . the hull of the cabin buckle violently - moan like a die elephant - peel inward revealing red and GREEN striping on the outside . a huge wing section rip through the structure - barely miss Jacob - take the greyhaire man 's head clean off - nail the stewardess in the gut and shove she body across and out the other side of the cabin . and Jacob 's seat drop down - send he and we into : ext . sky - night like a intricate ballet , Jacob , he body strapped to he chair , tumble away from the DC - 10 and 747 as they seem to merge and bend into some kind of mutant DC - 47 - wing and tail wrapping around each other as debris bloom out like a flower and together they explode - a fiery ball lighting the nighttime cloud and Jacob 's shriek face . and Jacob fall and fall and fall , he hair stick straight up from the blast wind . that 's when corpse start fall past he . the captain of the plane - the stewardess , she body bent in half - the greyhaire man , he head go but he book still in he hand . more man , woman , crew people - and child . but this child be not dead body . two little girl and one little boy , all dress in white , plummet down next to Jacob , head first , like high diver . and they be sing : the child one two , freddy 's come for you ... the child turn around in the sky so that they be travel foot first . the Little Boy 's pants puff up and the Girls ' skirt poof out and rip upward - the wind take away they clothes and they skin and they body and they hair ... the child ( cont would ) Three four , better lock you door ... leave three tiny skeleton - taunting and laugh as Jacob scream and cover he eye . the child ( cont would ) five six , grab you crucifix ... and the skeleton sprout wing - leathery and veiny - the wind catch they and send they up and away as they voice echo in the sky . the child ( cont would ) Seven eight , gonna stay up late ... Jacob take he hand away from he face and start to frantically pull on he seat belt . SNAP - it fly off he back and miraculously turn into a parachute . rope swirl into the air - the wind grab the canvas - and Jacob 's body slow with a violent jerk . but at least he 's not fall anymore . Jacob catch he breath as he start gently float through the sky . he smile . this be not so bad . this be actually kind of fun . not for long , though , because he new upward momentum carry he back up to : the winge child 's skeleton . Jacob 's eye bug out as he rise into they and they start to circle . they move closer and we can see something in they hand : scissor Jacob twist he body , try to steer he parachute away from the demon . one of the skeleton swoops up to he face and poke its scissors inch away from Jacob 's eye . it sing alone : child nine ten , never sleep again ! the skeleton crank its arm back - ready to plunge the scissor 's blade into Jacob 's socket . the arm swing toward he - then suddenly divert up past he head , head for : the chute string the skeleton flap its wing and poise its scissors at one of the rope . the other two skeleton join it over Jacob 's head . the three of they look down at Jacob , they boney jaw in a perpetual smile . jacob no ! the skeleton nod " yes " . snip - snip - snip - they cut away at Jacob 's parachute as he swing underneath they , try to pull away - snip - snip . the parachute flutter away - the skeleton cackle - and Jacob plummet . on jacob we stay with he as he scream and shriek and yell and the cloud part and the ground rise quickly up to meet he . the ground become a town , the town become a block , the block become a house , the house become a roof , and ... int . jacob be bedroom - night ka-blam ! the ceiling explode as Jacob 's body plow through , slam down , shatter the bed , and we immediately : CUT to : int . jacob be bedroom - morning Jacob 's eye blast open as he sit up from bed in a cold sweat . a dream . the worst fuck dream from hell anyone would ever want to have -- but still just a dream . he take a few deep breath as a soft knock be hear at the door . jacob yeah .. alice johnson open the door and stick she head in . she 's thirty - two , blonde , with a caring smile . alice you okay , honey ? jacob yeah , Mom .
