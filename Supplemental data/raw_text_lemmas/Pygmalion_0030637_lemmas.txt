" but my need be as great as the most deserve widow 's that ever get money out of six different charity in one week for the death of the same husband . I dont need less than a deserve man : I need more . I dont eat less hearty than he ; and I drink a lot more . I want a bit of amusement , cause I be a think man . I want cheerfulness and a song and a band when I feel low . well , they charge I just the same for everything as they charge the deserve . what be middle class morality ? just a excuse for never give I anything . therefore , I ask you , as two gentleman , not to play that game on I . I be play straight with you . I aint pretend to be deserve . I be undeserve ; and I mean to go on be undeserve .

I wouldnt speak to they , you know . pickering . better wait till we get you something really fashionable . higgins . besides , you shouldnt cut you old friend now that you have rise in the world . thats what we call snobbery . liza . you dont call the like of they my friend now , I should hope . theyve take it out of I often enough with they ridicule when they have the chance ; and now I mean to get a bit of my own back . but if I be to have fashionable clothes , I will wait . mrs . pearce [ come back ] now , eliza . the new thing have come for you to try on . liza . ah-ow-oo-ooh !

I know you be generous to everybody with money . but it be from you that I learn really nice manners ; and that be what make one a lady , isnt it ? you see it be so very difficult for I with the example of Professor higgins always before I . I be bring up to be just like he , unable to control myself , and use bad language on the slight provocation . and I should never have know that lady and gentleman didnt behave like that if you hadnt be there . higgins . well !! pickering . oh , thats only he way , you know . he doesnt mean it . liza . oh , I didnt mean it either , when I be a flower girl . it be only my way . but you see I do it ; and thats what make the difference after all . pickering . no doubt . still , he teach you to speak ; and I couldnt have do that , you know . liza [ trivially ] of course : that be he profession . higgins . damnation ! liza [ continue ] it be just like learn to dance in the fashionable way : there be nothing more than that in it . but do you know what begin my real education ? pickering . what ? liza [ stop she work for a moment ] you call I miss doolittle that day when I first come to wimpole Street . that be the beginning of self - respect for I .
