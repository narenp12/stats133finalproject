[ 1 ] steward Fine ! Fine ! she ought to like this . ( to the guard ) open the door . guard ( without move ) who 's gonna take it in to she ? you ? steward oh , no .

( he wheel on the steward ) why do not you do it yourself ? steward ( more afraid than the othersustammering ) why '' iwell , I never think about lacey ( shove he aside ) I never hear of such a thing ! afraid of a mere girl . ( move to the tray ) I will take it in myself . they all stand around and watch he , much relieved . he pick up the tray and start toward the door of the cabin . lacey ( as he walksutter ) can not get a thing do unless you do it yourself . ( as he approach the door ) open the door . we see he at the cabin door as the guard quickly and gingerly unlock it . lacey afraid of a mere girl ! ridiculous . lacey stalk in bravely , the tray hold majestically in front of he , while the steward and waiter form a circle around the door , wait expectantly . there be a short pause , follow which lacey come hurl out backwards and land on he back , the tray of food scatter all over he . the steward quickly bang the door shut and turn the key as the waiter stare silently . the scene dissolves to the MAIN deck of the yacht , first afford a close view of a pair of well - shod masculine foot , as they pace agitatedly back and forth . then as the scene draw back , the possessor of the pace foot be discover to be Alexander andrew , immaculately groom in yachting clothes . in front of he stand a uniform Captain , but andrew , brow wrinkle , deep in think , continue he pace . ? 209 ? andrews ( murmure to himself ) on a hunger strike , huh ?

( to the guard ) open the door . the Guard unlock the door and andrew enter . then we get a view of the cabin at the door , as andrew enter and close the door behind he . he look around and he eye light on he prisoner , follow which the view swing over to ellie , a beautiful girl in she early twenty . at the moment , she hold a small vase over she head ready to heave it , and she eye flash angrily . at sight of she new visitor , however , she lower the vase and set it on a small table . ? 210 ? ellie what do you want ? andrew do not stir from the door . andrews what 's this about not eat ? ellie ( sit ) I do not want to eat !

( to the waiter ) put it right here . ellie glare at she father , and wander over to the window seat , while the waiter occupy themselves set the table . andrew putter around the food , lift the lid from which tempting aromas emanate . he shut he eye , murmure " ooh " and " ah . " a close - up of ellie show she , too , drink in the invite aromas ; and for a moment she weaken . a close view of andrews show he glance toward ellie to see she reaction ; whereupon ellie 's face ( again appear in a close - up ) freeze . then andrew and the waiter come into view . first waiter anything else , monsieur ? andrews no. everything seem quite satisfactory . I may want some more of that delicious gravy . I will ring . waiter very good , monsieur . the waiter bow they way out as andrew peck at the food . andrews ( make cluck noise ) heavenly ! now ellie appear in the foreground , with andrew at the table in the background . ellie ( disdainfully ) smart , be not you ! so subtle . ? 212 ? andrews ( chew on a mouthful of food ) if Gandhi have a chef like Paul , it would change the whole political situation in India . ellie you can not tempt I .

( scream ) I be sick of it ! and as andrew ignore she , she start move around the table toward he . '' next she appear sit on the edge of andrew ' chair , and she throw she arm around he shoulder . ellie ( plead sweetly ) aw , listen , dad . let 's not fight like this any more . I know you be worried about meand want I to be happy . and I love you for it . but please try to understand . you be not be fair , darling . this be not just a crazy impulse of mine . King and I talk about it a lot before we decide to get marry . lookwhy can not we give it a triallet 's sayfor a year or so . if it 's wrong , King and I will be the first to know it . we can get a divorce , can not we ? now , be a dear , and let I off the boat . keeping I prisoner like this be so silly . andrew have be listen silently throughout the speech , give no indication of he feeling in the matter . andrews ( unimpress ) you will be set free when the marriage be annull . a close - up of ellie , she eye blaze angrily , show she slowly edging away from she father , while he continue . andrews ' voice ( carelessly ) so there 's no use be a stubborn idiot . ellie ( hiss ) I come from a long line of stubborn idiot ! andrews ( again see with she ; calmly ) a time will come when you will thank I for this . ellie ( wildly ) I will not thank you ! I will never thank you ! ? 215 ? andrews please do not shout . ellie I will shout to my heart 's content ! I will scream if I want to . andrews ( reach for it ) ah ! coconut layer cake . Nice and gooey , too . just the way I like it . he be about to insert the first bite in he mouth when ellie , she temper vanish completely , overturn the small serve table , dump its content into she father 's lap . the movement be so unexpected that andrew , the fork still suspend near he mouth , stare at she stupefy . then realize what she have do , he eye flash in anger . drop he fork , he rise and go over to she , while she stand face he defiantly . without a word or warning , he slap she a sting blow across the cheek . for a moment she do not stir , she eye widen in surprise , and stare at he unbelievingly . then turn abruptly she bolt out of the door . andrew remain motionless , he eye shutting painfully ; it be the first time he have strike she , and it hurt . andrews ( call ) ellie ! ( and he start for the door ) next on the deck , at the open cabin door , andrew be see , stare off at something and a amaze , frighten look come into he eye . then , as view from he position at the cabin door , ellie appear stand on the rail ; and with a professional dive , she leap into the water . a full view of the deck reveal the crew and the officer scurrying around , several of they shouting : " somebody overboard ! " andrews it 's my daughter ! go after she . captain ( shouting ) lower the boat ! General excitement reign ; several of the crew dive into the water ; other release the boat line . follow this ellie be see swim furiously against the giant wave . next she appear as a small speck in the distance , while half a dozen of the crew be swim in pursuit . at the side of the yacht one of the boat have already be lower , and two man jump in and grab the oar . the man seem to be gain on ellie . in the distance several small motor boat be anchore , and over the side of the boat they owner be fishing . ellie seem to be head in they direction . one of the motor boat appear closer . a middle - age man sit on the stern , hold lazily to he line , he foot dangle in the water as the boat be toss around by the turbulent wave . ellie be then again see swim . she look back , and the next scene show the man row toward she , and gain on she . thereupon we see ellie ducking under the water . ? 216 ? the middle - age fisherman be suddenly startle by ellie 's face which appear from under water , right between he leg . ellie put she finger up to she lip , warning he to shush , and he be too dumb-founded to say anything . as the pursue boat come near , ellie duck under the water again and the boat scoot right by the fisherman . then ellie 's head bob up ; she peer ahead of she , and see that she pursuer have pass she , she smile victoriously . ellie ( to the fisherman ) thanks . ( and she start swim toward shore ) the scene dissolves to the deck of the yacht as ellie 's pursuer clamber aboard , andrew wait for they . a man sorry , sir . she get away . andrews ( disappointed but proud ) of course she get awaytoo smart for you . captain what a hell cat . no control this modern girl . ( murmure ) they be terrible ! andrews ( resentfully ) terrible ! nothing terrible about she . she 's great ! marvelous youngster ! get a mind of she own . know just what she want . ( smile ) she 's not go to get it though . she will not get very far . have no money . captain what about that diamond wrist watch she have onshe can raise some money on that ? andrews ( he face fall ) Holy smoke ! I forget all about that . ( to the officer by he side ) send a wireless at once , " lovington detective Agency . daughter escape again . watch all roadsall transport and railroad station in Miami . have you New York office keep tabs on King westley . intercept all message . want she back at all cost ! " officer yessir . the view draw in to afford a close - up of andrews stare out at the sea , he face wreathe in a broad smile ; then this fade out . part two the railroad station of a active terminal in Miami fade in . the view move down to the entrance gate to the train , passenger hur - ? 217 ? rying through it ; then pick out two man , obviously detective , who have they eye peel on everyone pass through . then the view afford a glimpse of ellie , who stand watch the detective . this scene wiping off , we see a AIR transport , with several plane tuning up in the background . as passenger file through , several detective stand around in a watchful pose . this scene wiping off , the front of a western union office come into view . several people walk in and out . at the side of the door , two detective be on the lookout . this scene also wipe off , revealing the waiting room of a bus station . over the ticket window there be a sign read " buy bus ticket here , " and a line form in front of it . here too there be two detective . first detective we be wastin ' we time . can you picture ellie andrew ridin ' on a bus ? second detective I tell the old man it be the bunk . the view move from they to ellie , who stand behind a post and be watch the two detective apprehensively . as the two ( view from she position ) stand by the ticket window , one of they turn toward she . thereupon , we see she slip behind a post , conceal herself . just then a little old lady approach she . old lady here 's you ticket , mar 'am . ellie oh , thank you . thank you very much . ( she take the ticket and change from the old lady , and hand she a bill ) here . old lady oh , thank you . thank you . ellie when do the bus leave ? old lady in about fifteen minute . ellie thank you . she pick up a small overnight bag from the floor and hurry away . she cross to the entrance of the wait room and disappear through the door . the view then wing over to a telephone booth near the entrance . cluster around the booth be half a dozen man of varied appearance . the inside of the booth be light , and a young man , Peter warne , wave he hand wildly as he shout into the phone , although it be impossible to hear what he be say . a close inspection of the man surround the booth ( the scene contracting to a close view ) reveal they as be slightly and happily intoxicate . a short man approach the door of the booth . ? 218 ? shorty hey , what 's go on here ?

I guess he know now what I think of he job ! ( expansively ) be my chariot ready ? ? 220 ? first man you chariot awaiteth withouteth , oh mighty King . men make way for the King . Long live the King . make way . with head hold high , he strut majestically out of sight , follow by he admirer , follow which the scene dissolves to the bus station . his inebriated admirer stand around the entrance to a bus , while Peter stand on the step , he suitcase in he hand . peter ( make a grand speech ) that 's right , my friend . cling to you job ! remain slave the rest of you life ! scum of the earth ! newspaper man ! not I ! when I be bask in the glorious arm of the musewhat will you be do ?

Philadelphia , New York . all aboard . group look out . get back . farewell . farewell . peter scram . the scene cut to the interior of the bus as view from the front , the view move forward , pass the conglomerate of unprepossessing human being who occupy the seat . every space be take and the occupant seem hot and uncomfortable , which add to they uninvite appearance . mother cling to cry baby . a swedish farm hand and he young wife be already busy open they basket of food prepare for the long journey . a surly -look hoodlum travel alone be slump in he seat , he cap draw carelessly over he eye . the move view pass this and other character until it reach one unoccupy seat in the car , unoccupy except for several bundle of newspaper . stand before the seat be Peter , he suitcase in he hand , speculate as to what disposition to make of the newspaper . peter ( call ) hey , driver ! how about clear this stuff away ! several passenger ( see from he position in the back ) crane they neck to scrutinize the intruder . through a glass partition the driver can be see receive he last minute instruction from a superintendent , who stand on the run board , they voice in - ? 221 ? distinguishable . in answer to Peter 's request , the driver glance back indifferently , and continue talk to the superintendent . a close view of peter show he arching he eyebrow , a amused acknowledgment of the disdainful attitude of the driver . he drop he suitcase and start forward . then we see he arrive at the glass partition , and Peter tap playfully on the pane with he finger - nail , whereupon the driver turn and pull the window down a few inch . driver ( annoyed ) whadda you want ! peter ( pleasantly ) if you will be good enough to remove that newspaper I will have a seat . driver ( irritably ) okay ! okay ! keep you shirt on , young feller . ( with which remark the driver turn away from he ) peter ( look at the back of the driver 's neck for a moment , then confidentially ) just between you and I , I never intend take it off . he wheel around uncertainly and swagger jauntily down the aisle toward the empty seat . en route he bestow genial smile upon several of he disgruntled fellow passenger , and he stop in front of a robust lady who at the moment be breastfeed she baby while a light cigarette dangle from she lip . peter personally , I be raise on a bottle . ( as the woman look up at he , perplex ) when I be a baby , I insisted on it . you know why ? ( as the woman stare up stupidly ) I never like the idea of get cigarette ash in my eye . he move forward , leave the woman unable to make head or tail of it ; and assume that he 's crazy , she shrug she shoulder and turn she attention to the baby . now peter arrive at he seat , and whistling softly , raise the window . unhurriedly , he pick the newspaper bundle up one by one and fling they out of the window . they hit the sidewalk below with a dull thud . thereupon a close view of the driver show he reacting violently to Peter 's unprecedented cheek , and start down from he seat . peter have now clear the seat of all the newspaper bundle and still whistling he favorite melody , he pick up he suitcase preparatory to place it in the rack overhead . at this point , the driver enter the side door of the bus . driver ( pugnaciously ) hey , wait a minute ! ? 222 ?

( Peter , thwart for a moment , just glare at she ) peter ( also call ) Driver ! driver yeah ? ? 224 ? peter this seat accommodate two passenger , do not they ? driver ( hat to give in ) maybe they doand maybe they do not . Peter lift ellie 's overnight bag off the seat and drop it on the floor . part of she coat cover the small space by she side . this he sweep across she lap . peter move over , lady . this be a " maybe they do . " he plop into the seat , the other passenger around they heaving a sigh of relief . ellie flash he a devastating look and deliberately turn she back on he . but Peter suddenly look down toward the floor , follow which a close - up at there feet reveal that ellie 's bag on the floor annoys Peter . with he foot he slowly move it over to she , and ellie 's foot be see push it back , whereupon Peter viciously kick it over to she side again . next we see ellie glaring at he , pick up she bag , and stand on the seat deposit it on the rack overhead . but just then the bus start forward with a lurch which unbalance she , and she fall backward right in Peter 's lap . they nose almost touch . they eye meet , and they glare at each other hostilely . ellie quickly scramble off and get back in she seat , turn she back on he . peter ( amused ) next time you drop in , bring you folk . this dissolves to a country road , and the bus sway perilously as it speed through the night , follow which the view dissolves to the interior of the bus , revealing Peter slump in he seat , he hat draw over he eye . ellie have she head throw back , try to sleep . but the sway bus cause she head to roll from side to side uncomfortably , and finally she give up . ellie ( a order ) tell that man not to drive so fast . ( at which Peter just cock he head slightly ) peter be you talk to I ? ellie yes . tell that man to drive slowly . Peter stare at she a moment , resent she officious manner . peter ( pleasantly ) okay . and much to she surprise , he sigh deeply and relax to he former position , shutting he eye . she glare at he crushingly . the scene dissolves to another view of the bus , disclose the driver , and suddenly the bus come to a stop . ? 225 ? driver ( stick he head in to face the passenger ) Rest station ! ten minute ! the view draw back as some of the passenger rise . the man stretch they leg , and the woman straighten out they skirt . a close view of Peter and ellie then show she rise . Peter accommodatingly shove he foot aside for she to pass , and ellie start up the aisle . but she suddenly stop ; look back , first at she bag and then at Peter ; decide to take she bag with she , and return to take it . she reach for it on the rack , Peter watch she , amused . the scene dissolves to the outside of the rest station with several passenger walk briskly back and forth . the place be dimly light by one or two lamp -post , and Peter can be see lean against one of this post , smoking a cigarette . the scene move in , a close view of Peter show he steal a glance in the direction of ellie . and a view , from he angle , reveal ellie in the shadow of the bus , she bag at she foot . she slowly turn she head toward Peter and then quickly avert it . peter ( see close ) speculate about she . he glance around the place , and the scene move about , follow he gaze . it take in the other passenger , all obviously poor and unculture . the move view reach ellie . the contrast be perceptible . thereupon , we see Peter reacting with comprehension : no doubt about it ! she do not belong with this passenger . then suddenly he see something which startles he , and we see what it be : directly in back of she , the young hoodlum passenger slyly lift she overnight bag from the ground and start run with it . ellie be oblivious of he action . peter spring forward . ellie see Peter come toward she and be perceptibly startle . but Peter whizze by she , and this amaze she even more . she shrug she shoulder , perplex , and resume she smoking . in a few second Peter return , puffing breathlessly . peter he get away . I suddenly find myself in the middle of the brush and not a sign of the skunk . ellie ( see close with peter ) do not know what he 's talk about . she look at he , puzzle . ellie I do not know what you be rave about , young man . and , furthermore , I be not interested . peter ( take aback ) wellof all thewell '' ( hard ) maybe you will be interested to know you bag 's go . at this , ellie wheel around and stare at the spot where she bag have be . ellie oh , my heaven ! it 's go ! ? 226 ? peter ( sarcastically ) yeah .

( with which she disappear from the scene ) a close - up of peter show he glaring after she . ? 227 ? peter ( mumble ) why , you ungrateful brat ! the scene dissolves to the bus , where all the passenger be scatter back to they seat ; Peter be already seat , when ellie arrive . a close view then show she stand uncertainly for a moment , speculate whether to cross over he leg to get she place by the window . Peter feel she presence by he side and glance up . she toss she head and plant herself in the seat in front of he , vacate by the young man who steal she bag . Peter take the affront with a shrug and slide over gratefully to the covete spot near the window . the scene dissolves to a close view of ellie and a recently arrive fat man next to she . she have she head throw back in a effort to sleep , but the fat man , he hand clasped over he protrude stomach , snore disgustingly , and the rumble of the fly bus accompany he . suddenly the bus careen , the fat man fall against ellie , and she awaken with a start and push he back . the fat man 's snore go on uninterrupted , and ellie relax again ; but in a few second the procedure be repeat , and ellie be beside herself . she look around for somewhere to flee . peter , seat in back of she , in he customary slump position , open he eye slightly . it be apparent he have be watch she for some time , for he grin at she discomfiture . ellie 's head turn in he direction and the grin leave Peter 's face . he shut he eye and pretend to be asleep . ellie glance at Peter to make certain he be asleep . the fat man fall against she again and it be all she can stand . she start to rise . Peter see she come and deliberately put he hand on the seat next to he , still pretend to be asleep . just as ellie start to sit , she notice he hand and be embarrassed . gingerly she pick up he limp hand and place it on he knee . she then slide into the seat , sighing with relief , whereupon Peter open he eye and be amused . slowly he head turnsand he scrutinize she , soberly and appraisingly . ellie slowly turn she head for a glimpse of peterand be startle to find he gaze at she . she turn forward , she jaw set forbiddingly . the scene dissolves to the view of a road . it be dawn , and in the distance , against the horizon , the bus , a mere speck , make its lone way over the desert country . this dissolves to a large sign , read " jacksonville , " and then into the bus afford a close view of ellie and peter . they be both asleep , she head rest comfortably on he shoulder , Peter 's topcoat throw over she . then the view draw back . the bus be empty except for ellie and Peter , the last few passenger be just leave . peter 's eye slowly open . he look down at the head on he shoulder and grin . with a sigh , he shut he eye again and resume he slumber . next , at the front of the bus , the driver stand stare at Peter and ellie in this intimate position and he mouth twist knowingly . driver ( murmure ) oh , yeah ? ellie stir , squirm a little uncomfortably and with a sleepy grunt shift she position . just as she settles down , she eye open . she stare out of the window with unsee eye , and then close they ? 228 ? dreamily , give the impression that , still half conscious , she be try to recall where she be . apparently she do , for she eye suddenly snap open and she lift she head . finally ( in a scene include Peter ) , ellie realize that she have be sleep on he shoulder , whereupon she straighten up , embarrassed . ellie oh , I be sorry '' ( feebly smile ) silly , be not it ? she look around , and she find herself alone with Peter add to she embarrassment . ellie everybody 's go . she lift she arm to adjust she hat and become conscious of he coat over she which slip . she stare at it thoughtfully for a momentthen at Peter . ellie ( realize that he put it there ) oh , thank you . ( she hand he he coat ; ill at ease ) we be in jacksonville , be not we ? peter yes . ellie ( nervously ) that be foolish of I . why do not you shove I away ? peter I hate to wake you up . ( she glance at he speculatively ) how about some breakfast ? ellie no , thank you . ( she rise , anxious to get away ) thank you so much . most uncomfortably , she edge away from he toward the front of the bus , Peter watch she leave , he interest definitely provoke . the scene cut to the stand as ellie emerge from the bus . at the foot of the step be the driver . ellie how much time have I ? driver about a half hour . ellie I be go over to the Windsor Hotel . Peter appear in the door of the bus in the background , and a close view then show he stop to listen as he see ellie talk to the driver . ? 229 ? driver' voice the Windsor ! you will never make it in time . ellie' voice you will have to wait for I . driver' voice ( aghast ) wait for you ! a smile flit across Peter 's face ; then a wider view show ellie leave the driver . ellie ( as she go ) yes . I may be a few minute late . she disappear from sight , leave the driver stare at she , dumbly ; and Peter , stand in back of the driver , shake he head in amazement . the scene dissolves to the bus stand later that morningat the same spot where the bus have previously be . it be no longer there , however . a huge crowd fill the space , and the view move down through the crowd , singles ellie out . she have just arrive and look around helplessly . finally she spot a uniform terminal guard and approach he . ellie ( now next to the Guard ) where 's the bus to New York ? guard Left twenty minute ago . ellie why , that 's ridiculous ! I be on that bus '' I tell they to wait ! guard sorry , miss . it 's go . ( and he turn he back on she ) ellie 's face cloud . the crowd surge about she . she look around thoughtfully . suddenly she eye open in surprise at something she see , and the view then move over to Peter , who sit on he suitcase , look toward ellie . peter good morning . Peter be in the foreground , the guard be see in the background . ellie stare at Peter , perplex . peter remember I ? I be the fellow you sleep on last night . ellie seem to I I have already thank you for that . ( turn to guard ) what time be the next bus to New York ? ? 230 ? guard ( turn ) eight o'clock tonight . ellie eight o'clock ! why , that 's twelve hour ! guard sorry , miss . the Guard leave the scene , and ellie 's disappointment be apparent . peter ( sarcastically ) what 's the matter ? would not the old meany wait for you ? ( ellie glare at he , disdain to replythis anger he , and he continue hotly ) say , how old be you anyway ? do not you know this buss work on a schedule ? you need a guardian . ellie ( start away ) what be you excited about ? you miss the bus , too . Peter look at she a moment before replying . peter ( quietly ) yeah . I miss it , too . there be a close view of the two . she turn to he . her interest be provoke by he tone of voice . she glance up into he face . ellie do not tell I you do it on my account ! ( pause ) I hope you be not get any idea that what happen last night be '' ( she interrupt herself ) you need not concern yourself about I , young man . I can take care of myself . peter you be do a pretty sloppy job of it . ( he reach in he pocket ) here 's you ticket . ellie ( surprised ) my ticket ? peter I find it on the seat . ellie ( take it ) oh , thank you . must have fall out of my pocket . ? 231 ? while she be put the ticket away in she purse , Peter speak : peter you will never get away with it , miss andrew . ( this be a shock to ellie ) ellie ( weakly ) what be you talk about ? peter just a spoiled brat of a rich man . you and westley will make a ideal team . ellie ( bluff it through ) will you please tell I what you be rave about ! peter you will never get away with it , miss andrew . you father will stop you before you get half way to New York . ellie you must have I confuse with peter ( interrupt ) quit kid ! it 's all over the front page , you know , I have always be curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King westley . he pull a newspaper out of he pocket and hand it to she . ellie glance at the headline hurriedly . peter ( while she read ) take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami . that guy 's a phony . ellie ( look up at he ) I do not ask for you advice . ( she hand the paper back ) peter that 's right . you do not . ellie you be not go to notify my father , be you ? peter ( look at she squarely ) what for ? ellie if you play you card right , you might get some money out of it . ( a disdainful expression cross he face ) peter I never think of that . ? 232 ? ellie ( frantically ) listen , if you will promise not to do it , I will pay you . I will pay you as much as he will . you will not gain anything by give I away as long as I be willing to make it worth you while . I have get to get to New York without be stop . it 's terribly important to I . I would pay now , only the only thing I have when I jump off the yacht be my wrist watch and I have to pawn that to get this clothes . I will give you my address and you can get in touch with I the minute you get to New York . peter ( furious ) never mind . you know I have you peg right from the start , you be the spoiled brat of a rich father . the only way you can get anything be to buy it . now you be in a jam and all you can think of be you money . it never fail , do it ? ever hear of the word " humility " ? no , you would not . I guess it never occur to you to just say , " please mister , I be in trouble . will you help I ? " no ; that would bring you down off you high horse for a minute . let I tell you something ; maybe it would take a load off you mind . you do not have to worry about I . I be not interested in you money or you problem . you , King westley , you father , you be all a lot of hooey to I . he turn he back on she and leave . a close - up of ellie show she stare after he , she eye blaze angrily . in a telegraph office , Peter address a girl operator as he drop a telegram on the counter , which she read . peter ( brusquely ) you send telegram here ? operator ( recognize he apparently , sarcastically ) I be just fine thanks , and how be you ? ( read ) to " Joe Gordon , care of New York mail , New York . be I laugh . the biggest scoop of the year just drop in my lap . I know where ellen andrew be '' " ( look up excitedly ) no , do you really ? peter ( impatiently ) go on . go on send the telegram . operator " how would you like to have the story , you big tub ofof '' " peter mush . mush . ? 233 ? operator " Tub of mush . well try and get it . what I say about never write another line for you still go . be you burn ? Peter warne . " well , that will be $ 2.60 . peter send it collect . operator collect ? Peter ( firmly ) collect . as the clerk take the wire from he , scene fade out . part Three the bus terminal fade in . it be night now , and the rain come down in torrent . people scurry around to get into the bus as the voice of a announcer be hear : announcer's voice Bus for blah- blah - blah-blah '' charlestonblah -blah-blahand all point North to New York ! this dissolves to the interior of a bus , which be practically fill . Peter be in he seat , read a magazine , while ellie enter hurriedly from the rear door and start forward . as she approach Peter , she hesitates a second , and deliberately pass he , plunk herself into a seat in the opposite aisle . Peter turn just as she get seat . he glance at she indifferently . a close view show ellie seat next to a man who sit read a newspaper which cover he face . her eye be fix forward , she lip set adamantly . a close - up of the man next to ellie make it plain that he be a typical drummer . [ 3 ] at the moment he be absorb in a serial story , but suddenly he become aware of something at he foot , and without lowering the newspaper , he gaze slowly shift downward . at this , the view move down until it reach ellie 's trim ankle . her foot beat a regular tattoo on the floor ; she extreme agitation be evident . the view move back slowly , take in ellie 's shapely leg as far as the knee . then we see ellie and the drummer as he gaze be still fix on she leg . slowly he face break into a lascivious grin , he lower he paper , and turn for a scrutiny of she face . what he see apparently delight he , for he drop he paper completelyand smile broadly . drummer hi , sister '' all alone ? my name 's shapeley . ( ellie favor he with a devastating look which be waste on the drummer ) might as well get acquainted . it 's gonna be a long tripuget tiresome later on . specially for somebody like you . you look like you get class . ( he survey she from head to foot ) yessir ! with a capital K. ( he chuckle at he own sally ) and I be a guy that know class when he see it , believe you I . ? 234 ? a close - up of ellie , as shapeley 's voice continue , show she glance back at Peter , expect he to come to she rescue . shapeley' voice ask any of the boy . they will tell you . shapeley sure know how to pick them . yessir . shapeley 's the name , and that 's the way I like them . ellie again look toward Peter . but peter seem to have find something of unusual interest in he magazine . . . and we again see the harass ellie and the irrepressible shapeley , who continue . shapeley you make no mistake sit next to I . ( confidentially ) just between we , the kinda mugg you meet on a hop like this be not nothing to write home to the wife about . you gotta be awful careful who you hit up with , be what I always say , and you can not be too particular , neither . once when I be comin ' through North Carolina , I get to gabbin ' with a good -lookin ' mama . one of that young one , you know , and plenty classy , too . kinda strike my fancy . you know how it be . well , sir , you could 'a knock I over with a mack truck . I be just warming up when she 's yank offa the bus . who do you think she be ? huh ? might as well give up . the girl bandit ! the one the papers be writin ' about . ( he pull out a cigar , and continuesawed by the recollection ) yessir , you coulda knock I over with a mack truck . ( he light he cigar , take a vigorous puff , and turn to she again ) what 's the matter , sister ? you be not sayin ' much . ellie ( intend to freeze he ) seem to I you be do excellently without any assistance . ( this however only bring a guffaw from the drummer ) shapeley that 's pretty good . . . well , shut my big nasty mouth ! a close - up show ellie endure more of this as shapeley 's voice continue : shapeley' voice . . . look like you be one up on I . nothin ' I like better than to meet a high - class mama that can snap them back at you . ' Cause the colder they be , the hotter they get , be what I always say . now ellie and shapeley be see together , with Peter see in the background . ? 235 ? shapeley take this last town I be in . I run into a damenot a bad looker , eitherbut boy , be she a iceberg ! every time I open my kisser she pull a ten strike on I . it sure look like cold turkey for old man shapeley . I sell office supplies , see ? and this hotsy - totsy lay the damper on I quick . she do not need a thingand if she do she would not buy it from a fresh mugg like I . well , say I to myself '' shapeley , you better go to work . you be up against a lulu . well , I be here to tell you , sister , I open up a line of fast chatter that have that dame spinnin ' like a Russian dancer . before I get through she buy enough stuff to last the firm a year . and do she put on a act when I blow town ! ellie have scarcely listen to he , and have divide she attention between glance back at Peter and stare at shapeley as if he be insanenone of which bother shapeley . he go on with he merry chatter , blow ring of smoke in the direction of the ceiling . shapeley yessir . when a cold mama get hotboy , how she sizzle ! she kinda cramped my style , though . I do not look at a dame for three town . ( quickly ) not that I could not . for I it 's always a cinch . I get a much better chance than the local talent . ( confidentially ) you see , they be kinda leery about the local talent . too close to home . know what I mean ? ellie have now reach the point where she could , without any compunction , strangle he . shapeley' voice ( continue over this glimpse of she desperation ) but take a bird like meit 's here todayand go tomorrow . and what happen be nobody 's business . at this time she turn helplessly toward Peter , but we see peter be deliberately oblivious of she presence , follow which the three be see , with Peter in the background . shapeley but I do not go in for that kinda stuffmuch . I like to pick my filly . take you , for instance . you be my type . no kiddin ' sister . I could go for you in a big way . " fun-on- the-side shapeley " they call I , and the accent be on the fun , believe you I . ( this be all ellie can stand ) ellie ( snappily ) believe you I , you bore I to distraction . ? 236 ? ( but shapeley merely throw he head back and emit he characteristic guffaw ) shapeley ( laugh ) well , you be two up on I now . ( he hold up two finger ) peter ( approach they ) hey , you ! shapeley 's laugh die down . he look dumbly up at Peter , he two finger still hold in mid-air . shapeley huh ? peter ( indicate he own seat ) there 's a seat over there for you . shapeley what 's the idea ? peter I would like to sit with myuhwifeif you do not mind . ( at which shapeley 's face fall ) shapeley ( puzzle ) wife ? peter yeah . come oncome on ! shapeley ( rise ) oh , excuse I . ( edging away ) I be just tryin'you knowto make thing pleasant . and smile sheepishly , he sidle over to Peter 's seat , he two finger still poise in air . Peter plant himself next to ellie and totally ignore she , open he magazine , and resume he read . then ellie and Peter be see close together . she look up at he . ellie if you promise not to snap my head off , I would like to thank you . peter ( without turn ) forget it . I do not do it for you . his voice get on my nerve . she feel herself crush , and venture no further comment as Peter resume he interest in he magazine . a full view of the bus follow , and there be silence for a while as the bus slow down and come to a stop . almost simultaneously a boy make he appearance , sell magazine and candy . ? 237 ? boy here you be , folk . candypopcorncigarettesmagazines as ellie and Peter be see again , she turn and call to the boy : ellie here , boy ! peter ( turn to she ) what would you do ? Wire one of you friend for money ? ellie ( rummage in she purse ) no . it would be useless . Father would get the wire before they would . boy ( as he enter ) yes , mar 'am ? ellie a box of chocolate , please . peter ( to the boy ) never mind , son . she do not want it . ( he gesture with he thumb for the boy to leave ) boy ( puzzle ) but the lady say '' ellie of course I do . what do you mean peter ( to the boy ) beat it ! ( and the boy , frighten by he voice , leave ) ellie ( resentfully ) you have you nerve ! ( she start to rise ) here , boy ! Peter snatch the purse out of she hand and take the money out . ellie stare at he dumbfounded . peter a dollar sixty ! . . . you have four dollar last night ! how do you expect to get to New York at the rate you be go ? ellie ( vehemently ) that 's none of you business . peter ( with finality ) you be on a budget from now on . ? 238 ? ( he fling she purse back at she and pocket the money ) ellie now , just a minuteyou can n't peter shut up ! he return to he magazine , leave she stare at he petulantly as the scene fade out . part four somewhere on the road at night . this be apparently on the outskirt of a town . two local policeman and we bus driver stand in the foreground near a police booth . the rain sweep across they face as they talk . the passenger in the bus , which stand in the background , stick they head out , try to hear what be go on . first policeman you will not be able to pass till morning . second policeman not even then , if this keep up . Peter approach the group and be then see with the officer and the driver . peter what 's up ? first policeman Bridge wash outaround Dawson . driver look like we can not go through till morning . second policeman ( he only contribution ) not even then , if this keep up . first policeman any of you passenger want a place to sleepthere 's a auto camp up yonder a piece . peter ( interested ) yeah ? where ? first policeman ( point ) up yonder . see the light ? peter yeah . first policeman that 's it . dyke 's Auto Camp . peter thanks . ? 239 ? he dash toward the bus . then he appear at the side door of the bus . peter ( call ) hey , brat ! ( he be about to enter when he see ellie ) the view move to the rear door of the bus . ellie stand on the bottom step . ellie ( haughtily ) be you talk to I ! peter yeah . come onwe be stop here for the night . he disappear inside the bus through the side door . with a independent toss of she head , ellie turn and also enter the bus , but through the rear door . the scene dissolves to dyke' auto camp . ellie stand alone on the porch of a small bungalow , shelter from the rain . over she head be a sign read : office - dyke Auto Co.P. D. dyke , prop . she look about she restlessly , give the impression that she have be wait for someone . suddenly she be attract by something and gaze in its direction . then , as see by ellie in a long view , there appear , about twenty yard away , a small cabin , light on the inside ; and from it Peter emerge accompany by a manpresumably Mr. dyke . we can not hear what be be say ; from they movement , however , it be apparent that a exchange of money be take place . dyke wave he hand in departure and start toward ellie . at the same time , Peter call to she : peter ( shouting ) hey ! come on ! we be all set . ( say which he enter the cabin ) ellie hesitates a moment , then start toward the cabin . now she be hurry across the open space . en route she pass dyke . dyke ( as they pass ) good evening . hope you and you husband rest comfortably . ellie keep on run , but suddenly she stop dead and look back at dyke , follow which a close - up of ellie show she eye open wide with astonishment . her impulse be to call dyke back , to make he repeat what he saidto make certain she hear he correctly . but dyke be go , and she turn and glance thoughtfully in the direction of the cabin . then slowly the corner of she mouth screw up in a attitude of cynicism . so that 's it , be it ! he have give she no previous evidence of be " on the make " ; yet now , with the first opportunity '' . her thought , however , be interrupt by Peter 's voice : peter' voice well , bratwhat do you say ! ? 240 ? as she do not stir , there appear a close - up view of peter stand in the doorway of the cabin , look toward ellie . peter ( impatiently ) come on ! come on ! what be you go to do ? stand there all night ? ( he disappear inside ) for a long moment , ellie be lose in speculation as to how to proceed . then , toss she head defiantly , with she lip set grimly , she start toward the cabin until she reach it , stop in the doorway and peer in . as she do this , there be a view of the inside of the cabin , as see by she at the door . except for two cot on either side of the room , a few stick of cane furniture , a small table upon which stand a oil burner for cooking , the place be barren . at the moment Peter be attach a clothes line across the center of the room . his suitcase be already open . and now ellie step inside , surveying the place contemptuously . but Peter , with he back to she , be oblivious of she presence ; and as he work , he hum he favorite melody . ellie finally break the silence . ellie ( sarcastically ) darn clever , this armenian . peter ( see close as he turn ) yeah . yeah , it 's a gift . ( but he finish he hammer and turn to he suitcase ) ellie ( see with Peter ) I just have the unpleasant sensation of hearing you refer to as my husband . peter ( carelessly ) oh , I forget to tell you . I register as Mr. and Mrs. ( the matter - of - fact way in which he say this cause she eyebrow to lift ) ellie oh , you do ? what be I expect to doleap for joy ? peter I kind of half expect you to thank I . ellie you ego be colossal . peter ( blithely ) yeah . yeah , not bad . how 's you 's ? there be silence for a moment , and Peter proceed with the unpack of he suitcase . as she watch he , ellie 's mood change from one of anger to that of sarcasm . ? 241 ? ellie ( appear in a close - up , she face disdainful ) compare to you , my friend , shapeley 's a amateur . ( sharply ) whatever give you a idea you can get away with this ! you be positively the most conceit '' peter' voice ( interrupt ) hey , wait a minute ! ( appear beside she ) let 's get something straighten out right now . if you have any peculiar idea that I be interested in you , forget it . you be just a headline to I . ellie ( frighten ) a headline ? you be not a newspaper man , be you ? peter chalk up one for you side . now listen , you want to get to King westley , do not you ? all right , I be here to help you . what I want be you story , exclusive . a day - to- day account . all about you mad flight to happiness . I need that story . just between you and I I have get to have it . ellie now be not that just too cute ? there 's a brain behind that face of yours , be not there ? you have get everything nicely figure out , for yourself , include this . peter this ? oh , that 's a matter of simple mathematics . this cabin cost two buck a night and I be very sorry to inform you , wifey dear , but the family purse will not stand for we have separate establishment . ( he go back to the business of lay out he thing ) ellie ( start to leave ) well , thank you . thank you very much , buty you have be very kind . ( but the rain outside cause she to hesitate ) peter oh , yeah ? it 's all right with I . go on out in the storm , but I be go to follow you , see ? yeah . and if you get tough I will just have to turn you over to you old man right now . savvy ? now that 's my whole plot in a nutshell . a simple story for simple people . now if you behave yourself , I will see that you get to King westley ; if not , I will just have to spill the bean to papa . now which of this bed do you prefer ? this one ? all right . while he speak he have take the extra blanket from the cot and hang it over the clothes line . this manage to divide the room in half . ? 242 ? a close view at the door show ellie watch he with interest . ellie ( sarcastically ) that , I suppose , make everythinguhquite all right . peter ( the previous scene return ) oh , this ? I like privacy when I retire . I be very delicate in that respect . prying eye annoy I . ( he have the blanket spread out now ) behold the wall of jericho ! [ 4 ] maybe not as thick as the one that joshua blow down with he trumpet , but a lot safer . you see , I have no trumpet . ( take out pajamas ) now just to show you my heart 's in the right place , I will give you my best pair of pajamas . he fling they over to she , and she catch they and throw they on she cot . throughout the scene she have not budge from the door , but Peter now prepare to undress . peter do you mind join the israelite ? ellie you be not really serious about this , be you ? peter ( see at close range , go about the job of undress very diffidently ) all right , do not join the israelite . perhaps you be interested in how a man undress . ( and he hang he coat over the chair ) funny thing about that . quite a study in psychology . no two man do it alike . ( now he shirt be come off ) a close view of ellie show she stand stubbornly . peter' voice I once know a chap who keep he hat on until he be completely undress . ( chuckle ) make a comical picture . . . as the scene include both of they , Peter spread he shirt over he coat . peter year later he secret come out . he wear a toupee . he light a cigarette diffidently while she remain brazenly watch he , she eye flash defiantly . peter I have a idiosyncrasy all my own . you will notice my coat come firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow , accord to hoyle , [ 5 ] the pants should come next . but that 's where I be different . ? 243 ? ( he bend over ) I go for the shoe first . after that i ellie ( unable to stand it any longer ) smart aleck ! and thoroughly exasperate , she go behind the blanket , and plop on the cot . she sit on the edge , debate what to do , feel herself trap . her impulse be to leave , if only to show this smart aleck he 's not deal with a child , and she rise impetuously and move to the window . a close view at the window show she look out . the downpour have not abate one bit , and the heavy raindrop clatter against the window pane in a sort of challenge to ellie , whose jaw drop . she turn slowly back to the room , and as she do so she eye light on the cot . it look most invite ; after all , she have not have any rest for two night . she fall on the cot again , she shoulder sagging wearily . follow this , the view reveal both side of the blanket . Peter be already in he pajamas . peter still with I , brat ? ( there be no answer from ellie ) do not be a sucker . a night 's rest will do you a lot of good . besides , you have get nothing to worry about . the wall of jericho will protect you from the big bad wolf . a close view show ellie glance over at the blanket . despite herself , the suggestion of a smile flit across she face . ellie you have not get a trumpet by any chance , have you ? peter get the idea and smile broadly . peter not even a mouth organ . pull the cover back , he prepare to get into bed , hum as he do so . peter ( hum to himself ) who 's afraid of the big bad wolf '' the big bad wolf , the big bad wolf . ( louder ) she 's afraid of the big bad wolf , tra-la-la-la-la ( he spring into bed ) ellie smile , and wearily she pull she hat off she head . she sit this way a moment , thoughtfully ; then , determine , she look up . ellie do you mind put out the light ? peter not at all . ? 244 ? ( he lean over and snap it off ) the room be throw into darkness except for a stream of light come in the window from the night - light outside the camp . visible be Peter 's face and arm as he stare ceilingward , while on ellie 's side all we can see of she be she silhouette , except for such time as she get in direct line with the window . there be glimpsis of she as she move around in the process of undress , and we see , or rather sense , she dress drop to the floor . she now stand in she chemise ; this be white silk , it stand out more prominently against the darkness . she pick up the pajamas and back into a corner , follow which a close - up of she head and shoulder show she glance apprehensively toward Peter 's side of the room ; and hold the pajamas in front of she with one hand , with the other she slip the strap off she shoulder . she fling she " slip " over the blanket . peter , on he side of the room , look toward the blanket , and react to the " slip " come into sight . then other undergarment join the " slip " on the blanket . peter ( hoarsely ) do you mind take that thing off the wall of jericho ? ( a pause ) it 's tough enough as it be . ellie' voice oh , excuse I . ( and we see the underthings flip off the blanket . ) ellie 's side of the room appear , show she crawl quickly into bed , pull the cover over she and glance apprehensively in Peter 's direction follow which a close view show peter be very conscious of she proximity . the situation be delicate and dangerous ; the room be atingle with sex . he turn he gaze toward the blanket . the view move to the blanket , remain on it a moment . it be a frail barrier . the view then move back to Peter , whose eye be still on the blanket , he face expressionless . a close view of ellie , next show that she , too , have she eye glue on the blanket , a little fearfully . she turn she head and gaze at the ceiling for a moment . then suddenly she eye widenand she sit up abruptly . ellie ( seriously ) oh , by the waywhat 's you name ? peter ( see close ; turn he head toward she ) what 's that ? ellie ( both side of the blanket come into view ) who be you ? peter who , I ? why , I be the whippoorwill that cry in the night .

( he glance from the newspaper to shapeley , wonder how much he suspect ) shapeley if you wanna get anywhere nowadays , you gotta keep in touch with all the news , be what I always say . peter ( eyeing he expectantly ) that 's right . shapeley ( point to paper ) take that story there , for instance . be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smacker . peter ( non-committally ) yeahwould not it ? shapeley it 's a lotta dough . if I be to run across that dame , you know what I would do ? peter what ? shapeley I would go fifty - fifty with you . peter why ? ? 267 ? shapeley Cause I be a guy that do not believe in hoggin ' it , see ? a bird that figure that way wind up behind the eight ball , [ 10 ] be what I always say . peter what 's on you mind ? shapeley ( hard ) five g'sor I crab the work . peter you be a pretty shrewd baby .

( feel he ) get any firework on you ? shapeley ( weakly ) whyno peter ( carelessly ) that 's all right . I get a couple of machine gun in my suitcase . I will let you have one of they . ? 268 ? ( shapeley be beginning to realize he be in for something he have not bargain for , and stare speechlessly at Peter , who continue blandly ) expect a little trouble up North . May have to shoot it out with cop . the perspiration start appear on shapeley 's brow ( as we see he in a close - up ) . Peter 's voice continue : peter' voice ( with emphasis ) if you come through all right , you five G 's be in the bag . maybe more . I will talk to the " killer " see that he take care of you . shapeley ( finally find he voice ) the killer ? peter ( see with shapeley ; watch the latter to gauge the effect of he word ) yeah the " big boy " '' the boss of the outfit . shapeley ( shakily ) you be not kidnap she , be you ? peter ( tough ) what else , stupid ! you do not think we be after that penny - ante reward , do you ?

( he reach into he coat threateningly ) I gotta good mind to plug you . ( argue with himself ) I should not take any chance on you . shapeley ( break down ) you can trust I , mister . I will keep my mouth shut . peter . yeah ? ( he glare at shapeley a moment silently , as if make up he mind ) what 's you name ? shapeley oscar shapeley . peter where do you live ? shapeley Orange , New Jersey . peter get a couple of kid , huh ? shapeley yeah . just baby . peter you love they , do not you ? shapeley ( sense the threat ; horrify ) oh , gee , misteryou would and t you be not thinkin ' about peter ( threateningly ) you will keep you trap shut , all right . shapeley ( quickly ) suresure '' I will keep my trap shut . you can depend on I , mister . peter if you do not '' ever hear of bug dooley ? shapeley no . peter Nice guy . just like you . but he make a big mistake , one day . get kind of talkative . know what happen ? his kid be find in the bottom of the ? 270 ? river . a rock tie around its neck . poor bug ! he could not take it . blew he brain out . ( shapeley can not stand much more of this . he be ready to keel over ) shapeley gee ! that musta be terrible . ( righteously ) I guess he have it come to he though . but do not you worry about I . I do not talk . I never talk . take my word for it . gee , I would not want anything to happen to my kid . peter okay . just remember that . now beat it . shapeley ( grab Peter 's hand and shaking it gratefully ) oh , thanks , thanks , mister . I always know you guy be kind -heart . peter ( put he hand away ) come on , scram ! and stay away from that bus . shapeley sure . anything you say . as he say this , he back away from Peter , follow which a close - up of peter show a twinkle in he eye and then , as see by Peter , shapeley appear walk hurriedly away . when he think the distance be safe he start run . he slip and fall in the mud , pick himself up , and continue he race for life . the scene dissolves to the road , at night , with ellie and Peter walk along . it be apparent they have be trudging like this for a long time . ellie poor old shapeley . you should not have frighten he like that . peter at the rate he start , he 's probably pass two state line by this time . the exercise be good for he . ellie yes , I notice he be get a little fat lately . ( she grab she side ) ouch ! peter what 's the matter ? ellie ( grimace ) I be never build for this moonlight stroll . ( protest ) why do we have to leave the bus ? ? 271 ? peter I do not trust that chatterbox . the scene dissolves to the bank of a narrow stream at night . Peter be bend over , remove he shoe , and we see the two closer as they talk . peter first town we hit in the morning , you better wire you father . ellie not as long as I be alive . peter okay with I , if you can stand the starvation diet . ellie what do you meanstarvation ? peter it take money to buy food . ellie why , have not you ? peter ( interrupt ) not a sou . I have some before the fainting scene . ellie you do not give that boy all you money ? peter I do not give he anything . you be the big-heart gal . how about wiring you father now ? ellie never ! I will get to New York if I have to starve all the way . peter ( risingutter a deep sigh ) must be some strange power westley have over you woman . ( he now have he shoe off and tie they to each other ) how do you expect to get there ? ellie to New York ? peter yeah . ellie I be follow you . peter be not you afraid of I ? ? 272 ? ellie ( confidently ) no . peter ( look at she ) okay . hang on to this . as he bend down in front of ellie , he get a firm grip around she leg and throw she over he shoulder like a sack . she squeal , terrify , but Peter ignore this ; and with he right hand , which be free , he lift the suitcase and start walk across the stream . ellie 's first fright be go and she now rather enjoy the sensation of be carry by Peter . she let herself go completely limp , still cling to he shoe , which she carry by the string . as they walk , the dangle shoe keep hit Peter 's backside . peter I wish you would stop be playful . ellie ( thereupon hold the shoe out at a safe distance ) sorry . ( Peter take several more laborious step before either of they speak ) ellie it 's the first time I have ride " piggy - back " in year . peter this be not " piggy -back . " ellie of course it be . peter you be crazy . ellie ( after a silence for several second ) I remember distinctly Father take I for a " piggy - back " ride '' peter and he carry you like this , I suppose . ellie yes . peter ( with finality ) you father do not know bean about " piggy - back " riding . ellie ( another silence before she speak again ) my uncle mother 's brotherhad four child . . . and I have see they ride " piggy -back . " ? 273 ? peter I do not think there 's a " piggy - back " rider in you whole family . I never know a rich man yet who be a good " piggy - back " rider . ellie that 's silly . peter to be a " piggy - backer " it take complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature . ellie and rich people have none of that qualification , I suppose . peter not a one . ellie you be prejudice . peter show I a good " piggy - back " rider and I will show you somebody that 's human . take abraham lincoln , for instancea natural " piggy -backer . " ( contemptuously ) where do you get off with you stuff - shirt family ? ( turn ) why , you father know so much about " piggy - back " riding that he in he excitement he wheel around to speak to she , forget that as he turn she go with he . not find she at he right , he swing around to he leave . naturally he take ellie with himand realize he mistake he mutter : peter aw , nut ! he proceed on he way , walk faster than before . they continue this way silently for some time . finally ellie break the silence . ellie ( persistently ) my father be a great " piggy -backer . " Peter raise he eye heavenward in thorough disgust , then calmly hand he suitcase to she . peter hold this a minute . ellie take the suitcase from he , and he hand now free , he deliver a resounding smack on she backside , so that ellie let out a yelp . peter ( take the suitcase ) thank you . ? 274 ? the scene dissolves to the edge of a cow pasture , at night , and ellie and Peter be reveal climb under a barb wire fence , follow which the scene dissolves to a haystack , in front . Peter set he bag down and survey the layout , ellie watch he . peter ( to himself ) this look like the best spot . ellie we be not go to sleep out here , be we ? peter I do not know about you , but I be go to give a fairly good imitation of it . and he busy himself lay out a bed for she , pull hay from the stack and spread it out on the ground . ellie wander aim -lessly and then move to a rock , where she sit and watch Peter . ellie ( after a pause ; coyly ) peter peter ( as a close view show he still arrange she bed ; grumble ) what ? ellie' voice I be hungry . peter ( without look up ) just you imagination . ellie ( see at the rock , while Peter be out of sight ) no , it be not . I be hungry andand scared . peter' voice you can not be hungry and scared at the same time . ellie ( insist ) well , I be . peter ( as both he and ellie be see in they respective place ) if you be scared it scare the hunger out of you . ellie ( argumentatively ) not if you be more hungry than scared . peter ( impatiently ) all right . you win . let 's forget it . ? 275 ? ellie ( after a pause ) I can not forget it . I be still hungry . peter ( tear he hair ; scream ) Holy smoke ! why do I ever get mix up with you ! this bring silence , and he go on building a bed for she . then a close - up of ellie show she watch he . her eye soften . a very definite interest in he be slowly but surely blossoming , and the fact that he be make she bed add to the intimacy of the scene . a close view of peter show he concentrate on he task , but he pause a moment and turn to glance at she . it be a devour look , which he quickly dispel by work more feverishly on she bed . peter ( mutter while he work ) if I have any sense , I would have be in New York by this time . ( he emphasize he feeling by yanking viciously at the hay as both of they be now see ) take a marry woman back to she husband . hunh ! what a prize sucker I turn out to be . ( he have she bed ready ; without glance at she ) come onyour bed 's all ready . she , watch he a moment , then rise slowly , start toward Peter . then she stand over she bed , surveying it speculatively . ellie I will get my clothes all wrinkle . peter ( sharply ) well , take they off . ellie ( shocked ) what ! peter ( shouting ) all right ! do not take they off . do whatever you please . but shut up about it . she flash he a petulant , offended glance but it be lose on Peter , who have he back to she , and meticulously , she slip to she knee and proceed to stretch out on the hay . the hay bed be bumpy and hard and she have quite a difficult time get comfortable ; she effort to do so be accompany by painful sigh . a close view show peter stop to watch she , and he look be sympathetic and solicitous . then while ellie groan and sigh and pound the hay with she palm , Peter step out of sight . ellie be unaware of he departure , so busily occupy be she with she makeshift bedding . she squirm around unhappily and finally stretch out , decide to make the best of it . she lie on she back , she hand clasped under she head , look up at the star . ellie ( see close , as she be lie back on hay bed ) you be become terribly disagreeable lately . snap my head off every time I open my mouth . ? 276 ? ( she wait for a reply , but receive none ) if be with I be so distasteful to you , you can leave . ( independently ) you can leave any time you see fit . nobody 's keep you she . ( martyr-like ) I can get along . she wait a second and then turn to see what effect this have on he . the fact that Peter be go do not quite register at first . she look around calmly , then be puzzle , and finally she become panicky . she sit up with a start . ellie ( murmure , frighten ) peter ( there be a pause while she listen , but nothing stir , and there be more apprehension in she voice ) Peter ! Real terror come into she face , and she be ready to cry . she get to she foot . ellie ( with a terrify outcry ) Peter !! at this he come run into the scene ; under he arm he have a watermelon . peter what 's the matter ? ellie ( relieved ) oh , peter ( she throw she arm around he neck and sob freely ) peter ( hoarsely ) what 's get into you ? ellie ( cling to he ) oh , Peter ! I be so scared . with he free hand he remove she arm from around he neck and start away . peter ( set the watermelon down ) I be not go more than a minute . just go out to find you something to eat . ellie ( a sob still in she voice ) I knowbut ? 277 ? peter ( kick the melon over to she ) here . eat you head off . ellie I do not want it now . peter ( vehemently ) think you be hungry ! ellie I wasbut peter but what ! ellie I be so scaredthat it scared peter ( exasperatedly ) Holy jumping catfish ! you can drive a guy crazy . he kick the melon viciously out of sight , and without any particular preparation or fuss , he flop down on he bed , follow which ellie go to she bed and lie down , too . then a close view of ellie appear , and at the moment she look far remove from the spoiled , pampere , self - reliant brat of Alexander andrew . instead , she be a helpless baby , cling to Peter 's protective wing . she would be ever so grateful right now for a little civility on he part , for a little tenderness and understanding , and she glance over at he , hopefully . peter , however , stare up at the star , dreamily ; and we then see ellie turn away from he , disappointed . still , the minute ellie turn she head , Peter look at she out of the corner of he eye , and it 's a long and steady gaze . then suddenly he get a idea and rise . he find he topcoat and go to she . peter might get chilly later on . ( he spread it over she ) better use this . as he bend down to tuck she in , they face be see in close proximity . ellie , tremulous and fearful , have she eye peel on he . the situation be imminent with danger ; anything be likely to happen at this moment ; and she be frighten and expectantshe know how weak she would be , if he suddenly crush she in he arm . Peter avoid she gaze . he , too , be a bit shaky . the temptation be there and he resistance be wane . he tuck she in and quickly turn away . ellie 's eye , however , never leave he . immediate danger have vanish , and it leave she a little regretful . a close view of peter , as he walk over to a rock and sit down , show he nervously take out a cigarette and lighting it . peter you have have a lot of man crazy about you , have not you ? ellie do not respond . she have the scrutinize , speculative look of a girl who feel herself fall in love with someone who be practically a stranger to she , as a result of which she be ? 278 ? frighten . then a wider view include both of they and we see that Peter , too , fight valiantly against a mount interest in this girl , who epitomize everything he dislike . he create the impression in the follow scene that in he analysis of she he be try to dissuade himself from something he be bound to regret . his attack on she , consequently , be overly vicious . peter I guess you have pretty much have you own way with they . that 's you trouble mostly . you have always have you own way . that 's why you be such a mess now . he pause a second , wait for a protest , but ellie offer none ; she be too much absorb in she own confusing emotion . a close view then show peter take a long puff on he cigarette and exhaling the smoke , watch it vanish before he speak . peter ( suddenly ) you know what generally happen to people like you ? you get you value all mix up . you attach all the importance to the wrong thing . right now , for instance , there 's only one think in you mindto get back to king westley . he wait for a reaction , but a close view show ellie absorb , and she remain silent . Peter 's voice continue . peter' voice comical part of it be , it be not what you want at all . in a couple of week you will be look for the nearest exit . . . ( now see with she ) people like you spend all you life on a merry - go-round . I guess that 's what make you so dizzy . ( he rise and pace a few moment ) you be always chase after something . at least you think you be . Truth be , you be just run away . ( emphatically ) from yourself , mostly . ' Cause you be miserable . you hate yourself . the world 's full of people like you . do not know what they want . ellie do you know ? peter sure . ellie what ? peter ( flatly ) nothing . ( after a pause ) nothing you would give two cent for . ? 279 ? ellie ( see close ) try I . peter' voice I just want to be let alone , that 's all . life 's swell if you do not try too hard . most people want to get a strangle - hold on it . they be not live . they be just feverish . ( now appear with she ) if they do not get themselves all ball up with a lot of manufacture value , they would find what they want . peace and calm . when you get right down to it , what 's all the shootin ' for , will you tell I ? after all , you can only eat three meal a day , only sleep in one bed '' ( look up ) right now , that hay feel pretty good to you , do not it ? sure it do . ' Cause you be tiredand it 's the only thing around . ellie you sound like a hobo . peter I be . I only work when I have to . two year ago I get a notion and go to China . there be a war go on . swell ! after a while it get stale . I go down to tahiti . just lay on the beach for six month . what could be sweeter ? ellie do not sound very exciting . peter , see close , look at she for a long time before speak : peter I guess not . I would have give odd it would not mean anything to you . ( he go over and flop down on he own side of hay ) there be moment when I have hope . when iaw , I be waste time '' you be destine to be a dope the rest of you life . ( contemptuously ) I pity you . goodnight . he turn over with a finality that preclude any further discussion , follow which a close - up of ellie reveal that she eye be wide open , stare thoughtfully up at the sky . the scene fade out slowly . part Seven a road fade in . it be day now , and Peter and ellie be trundle along . ellie limp , and wear a unhappy expression on she face . ellie what be you think about ? peter by a strange coincidence , I be think of you . ? 280 ? ellie ( pleased ) really ? peter yeah . I be just wonder what make dame like you so dizzy . ellie what would you say we be suppose to be do ? peter hitch-hike . ellie well , you have give I a very good example of the hike '' ( strongly ) where do the hitching come in ? peter ( amused at she ) a little early yet . no car out yet . she spy a rock and head for it . then we see she seat on the rock . ellie if it 's just the same to you , we will sit right here till they come . ( Peter come over , set he bag down , and prepare to wait ) get a toothpick ? peter no . but I have get a penknife . ( he extract one from he pocket which he snap open ) ellie hayin my tooth . she point to she front tooth , and Peter flick the hay out of she tooth . peter there it be . better swallow it . we be not go to have any breakfast . ellie need not rub it in . ( Peter take a carrot out of he coat pocket and start nibble on it ; ellie look up at this ) what be you eat ? peter carrot . ellie Raw ? peter uh-huh . want one ? ? 281 ? ellie ( emphatically ) no !! ( as Peter smack he lip with satisfaction ) it 's a wonder you could not get I something I can eat . peter you do not think I be go around panhandle for you . ( he take a bite ) best thing in the world for you'carrot . have a tough time get they . if that farmer ever catch megoodnight ! ellie I hate the horrid stuff . while she speak a car roar by at terrific speed . Peter and ellie both jump up . peter I wish you would not talk too much . we let a car get away . ( ellie go back to she rock , despondently ) ellie what if nobody stop for we ? peter oh , they will stop , all right . it 's a matter of know how to hail they . ellie you be a expert , I suppose . peter expert ! go to write a book on it . call the " hitch -hiker hail . " ellie there 's no end to you accomplishment . peter you think it 's simple , huh ? ellie ( exaggeratedly ) oh , no ! peter well , it be simple . it 's all in the thumb , see ? a lot of people do it ( wave ) like this . ( he shake he head sadly ) but they be all wrong . never get anywhere . ellie tch ! tch ! I be sorry for the poor thing . ? 282 ? peter but the thumb always work . different way to do it , though . depend on how you feel . for instance , number one be a short , jerky movement '' ( he demonstrate ) that show independence . you do not care if they stop or not . ' Cause you get some money in you pocket , see ? ellie clever . peter number two be a wider movementa smile go with that onelike this . ( he demonstrate ) that mean you get a couple of brand new storey about the farmer 's daughter . [ 12 ] ellie you figure that all out yourself , huh ? peter oh , that 's nothing . now take number three , for instance . that 's a pip . it 's the pathetic one . when you be brokeand hungryand everything look black . it 's a long movement like this '' ( demonstrate ) with a follow through . ellie amazing . peter hm ? yeah , but it 's no good if you have not get a long face with it . in the distance a car be hear approach , and ellie look up quickly . ellie ( excitedly ) here come a car ! peter ( alert ) now watch I . I be go to use number one . keep you eye on that thumb , baby , and see what happen . Peter step forward into the road and do he thumb movement . the car approach , but speed right by , spread a cloud of dust in Peter 's face , leave he stare at the depart car , nonpluss . thereupon ellie ( see close ) glance up at he , a satirical expression on she face . ellie ( sarcastically ) I be still watch you thumb . Peter be still look after the car . ? 283 ? peter something must have go wrong . I guess I will try number two . ellie when you get up to a hundred , wake I up . another car be hear come , and Peter step forward , prepare to hail it . then this dissolves to a long view of the road as a stream of car of every description speed forward ( " toward the camera " ) and vanish . the view move in to the side of the road , Peter be see still in the same spot . he wave he arm , jerk he thumb , indulge in all sort of gyration , while ellie remain slump on she rock , completely wear out . now ellie watch Peter out of the corner of she eye , she face expressionless . Peter continue he arm wavingbut slow down like a mechanical toy which have run out . he finally get down to just thumbing he nose at the pass vehicle ; and then thoroughly weary , he flop down on a rock near ellie . peter I guess maybe I will not write that book after all . ellie yes . but look at all the fun you have . ( as he glare at she ) mind if I try ? peter ( contemptuously ) you ! do not make I laugh . ellie you be such a smart aleck ! nobody can do anything but you . I will show you how to stop a carand I will not use my thumb . the scene widen as she rise and step forward . peter what be you go to do ? ellie mind you own business . she lift she skirt to above she knee and pretend to be fix she garter . her very attractive leg be in full display . almost instantly , we hear the scream and grind of quickly apply brake , and Peter look up astonished . the scene wiping off , we then get a closer view of ellie and Peter sit in the back of a open Ford . it be a break -down , rickety affair of the 1920 vintage . ellie grin victoriously up at Peter , who stare ahead of he , glumly . ellie you might give I a little credit . peter what for ? ? 284 ? ellie I prove once and for all that the limb be mightier than the thumb . peter why do not you take all you clothes off ? you could have stop forty car . ellie we do not need forty car . Peter glare at she , and ellie 's eye twinkle mischievously , follow which we get a wider view which include the driver of the car , danker . he be a man of about thirty , a heavy set , loose chin person ; at the moment he be sing a aria from some opera . he suddenly stop , turn to ellie and Peter in the back seat . danker so you have just be marry , huh ? well , that 's pretty good . if I be young , that 's just the way I would spend my honeymoon_hitch-hiking . y-e 's s-i-r ! and for no reason except that he cue himself into it , he burst forth into song gustily . danker ( sing ) " hiking down the highway of love on a honeymoon . hitch-hike down down-down -down the highway down . " ellie and Peter in the back of the car react to the noise danker make . peter hey , hey , be not you afraid you will burn out a tonsil ? danker tonsil ? me? no ! I burn a tonsil ? ( sing ) " my tonsils will not burn as life 's corner I . . . peter ( give up ) all right , let it go . danker ( complete he last line ) . . . turn . " the scene dissolves to the front of a lunch wagon on a desert road , and danker 's car drive into the scene and stop . then we see danker turn to ellie and Peter . danker how about a bite to eat ? ? 285 ? ellie ( quickly ) why , I think that would be peter ( stop she ) no , thanks . we be not hungry . danker ( sentimentally ) oh , I see , young people in love be never hungry . peter no . danker ( sing as he leave they ) " Young people in love be very seldom hungry . people in love be very seldom hungry . . . " when he be out of sight , Peter glare at ellie . peter what be you go to do ? gold dig he for a meal ? [ 13 ] ellie ( defiantly ) why not ? I be hungry . peter eat a carrot . ellie never ! ( she start out of car ) I be go in and ask him peter ( grab she arm ) if you do , I will break you neck . she look up at he glower face , realize he mean it , and wilt under he dominant gaze . peter let 's get out and stretch we leg . Peter get out , follow by ellie , and they walk away from the car . both be silent . at the door of the lunch wagon , then , danker come out and look around furtively . ellie and Peter , as see by he , appear , walk away , follow which the view move over to the Ford and drop down to a close - up of Peter 's suitcase . now danker look about quickly and start toward he car . he spring into the car , step on the starter , and be off . ellie and peter hear the motor . they wheel around , and they eye widen in surprise . ? 286 ? peter hey ! he fling he coat at ellie and dash after the Ford . he be then see run after it when the car turn around a bend in the road . Peter continue the pursuit . this scene wiping off , the ford now make its appearance around the bend , and as it approach , Peter be see at the wheel . he look like he 's just be through a fight . and as Peter ride in , ellie come run toward he . ellie ( a note of great relief in she voice ) oh , Peter ! what happen ? be you all right ? peter come onget in . ellie ( notice a gash in he cheek ) oh , you have be hurt ! there 's a cut on peter ( impatiently ) come on ! come on ! ( at this she run around to get in the other side ) ellie ( as she run ) what happen ? peter ( as we see they closer ) just a road thief . pick people up and run off with they stuff . what a racket ! ( by this time she be in the car ) ellie what would you give he for the car ? peter a black eye . ( thereupon the car move out of sight ) a close view show Peter and ellie drive along in the Ford . Peter look ahead , uncommunicatively . ellie glance up at he , and it be plain that something 's on she mind . ellie ( a little self - consciously ) lookuhhow be the'uhuhuots hold out ? any leave ? Peter glance at she . he know what a concession this be on she part , and he smile sympathetically . peter ( tenderly ) you do not have to eat the carrot . ( as she look she surprise ) just pass a pond with some duck in it . ellie ( with a cry of joy ) darling ! ? 287 ? she reach up and kiss he cheek , and Peter beam happily . peter ( look worried ) have not much gas leave in this thing . get to start promote some . ( throw she he coat ) better take the thing out of the pocket of that coat . ought to be good for ten gallon . the scene fade out . part eight andrews ' study fade in , afford a close view of King westley . he answer every description we have have of he . he be a stiff , handsome , stuff - shirt gigolo . he sit in a chair , lean on a cane , he glove loosely in he hand . the view then move back to reveal andrew , who , from the open of the scene , be speak as he pace around the room . andrews I have not change my mind , westley , I want you to understand that !

" it read : " dear Sir : I should like to have a talk with you about a financial matter in connection with you daughter . Peter warne . " ellie be then see read and re-read the note . her face cloud and then slowly change to a expression of complete disillusionment . ? 315 ? ellie ( she voice strident ) look like that be he only interest in I . the reward . andrews ( take the note from she ) I be sorry you read it . ellie be you go to see he ? andrews I suppose so . ellie ( hard ) certainly ! pay he off . he 's entitle to it . he do a excellent job . kept I thoroughly entertained . it 's worth every penny he get . she pace agitatedly , andrew watch she silently . he know what a awful blow to she pride this must be .

( he give she a kiss , which she accept perfunctorily '' but he insist upon be ardent ) be you happy ? ellie ( release herself ) happy ? why should not I be happy ? I be get the handsomest man in captivity . ( hand he a drink ) here you be , King . let 's drink . ( she hold she glass out ) let 's drink to we . ? 316 ?

I want we life to be full of excitement , King . we will never let up , will we ? never a dull moment . we will get on a merry - go-round and never get off . promise you will never let I get off ? it 's the only way to live , be not it ? no time to think . we do not want to stop to think , do we ? just want to keep go . king whatever you say , darling . ellie I hear about you stunt . that 's swell , King . just think of itthe groom land on the lawn with a plane . it 's a perfect beginning for the life we be go to lead . it set just the right tempo . ( hand he a drink ) come on , King . you be lag . ( they both drink ) in andrews ' study , andrew walk around the room , perceptibly affect by he visit with ellie . he keep turn Peter 's letter over in he hand , apparently debate in he mind what to do with it . he finally get a ideaand determinedly cross to the phone . then the scene cut to a HOTEL room . first there be a close - up of a newspapera tabloid bear a head which read : " love triumphant . " " interrupted romance of ellen andrew and King westley resumed , as Father yield . wedding reception to be held on andrew ' lawn . " below this be a page of picture , and the view turn to each photograph . the first picture be of ellie and King on a beach . the title over the picture read : " where they meet . " the second picture show they in the cockpit of a plane , the head read : " where they romance . " the next picture be of a small frame house with a shingle on it read : " justice of the peace . " over the photograph be a caption : " where they be marry . " the next picture be of the andrew yacht , and the title read : " where she be take . " finally , the view move down to the bottom of the page to a picture of ellie and King , with she father between they , in front of sheriff 's office . caption read : " where love triumph . " over this picture the phone bell have be ringing . and now peter be see stare , expressionless , at the newspaper . suddenly he become conscious of the phone ringing ; he look upthen go to it . peter ( into the phone ) hello . . . yes ? . . . who ? . . . oh . . . why can not I see you at you office ? the scene cut to andrews ' study , afford a close view of andrews at the phone . ? 317 ? andrews I leave for Washington tonight . May be go several week . think perhaps you would like to get this thing settle . this cut to the HOTEL room where peter be at the phone . peter yeah , but I do not like the idea of walk in on you jamboree . . . just between you and methose thing give I a stiff pain . andrews ( see in he office ) you need not see anybody . you can come directly to my study . I would appreciate it very much if '' peter ( at he phone ) nono . what the deuce do I want to his eye fall on something , and there follow a close view of a tabloid newspaper , feature the head : " Love triumphant " and contain the picture of ellie and King . the view then move down to feature headline read " Groom to land on bride 's lawn . " " King westley plan to drop in a autogyro on the lawn of andrew estate . . . " Peter 's mouth screw up disdainfully . peter ( into the phone ) yeah , wait a minute . maybe I will come over . I would like to get a load of that three - ring circus you be pull . I want to see what love look like when it 's triumphant . I have not have a good laugh in a week . ( he be still at the phone as the scene dissolves ) then the lawn of the andrews estate dissolves in . it be now fill with guest , who wander around , chatter gaily . the orchestra play . a captain of waiter in the foreground instruct he man . captain I want everything to be just so . when the ceremony start , you stand on the sidestill . no move aroundno talk , comprenez ? the view cut to a roadway lead to the estate , and Peter be see drive up in he Ford and squeezing in between two roll -royces . the uniform chauffeur glare at he . but Peter spring nonchalantly out of he car . peter ( blithely , as he pass they ) keep you eye on my car when you be back up , you guy . and as he go , the chauffeur look at each other , surprised . the scene dissolves to andrews ' study , where a butler stand in front of andrew who be seat at he desk . ? 318 ? andrews show he in . the butler leave , a close view show andrews reach over and snap on a dictograph conceal somewhere on he desk . the office come into view again , we see andrew rise and await Peter 's entrance . after a moment Peter come in , remove he soft feel hat , and tuck it under he arm . andrews Mr. warne ? peter yeah . andrews come in . sit down . Peter advance into the room , look around curiously . his air be frigid , contemptuous as andrew study he , and he make no move to sit . andrew wave to a chair and sit down himself . Peter flop into the nearest chair . andrews ( see close with Peter ; after a pause ) I be surprised to get you note . my daughter have not tell I anything about you . about you help she . peter that 's typical of you daughter . take that thing for grant . ( too restless to sit , he jump up ) why do she think I lug she all the way from miami ( vehemently ) for the love of it ? andrews please understand I . when I say she do not tell I anything about it , I mean not until a little while ago . she think you be entitle to anything you can get . peter ( bitterly ) oh , she do , huh ? be not that sweet of she ! you do not , I suppose . andrews ( shrugging ) I do not know . I would have to see on what you base you claim . I presume you feel you be justified in '' peter ( see close now ) if I do not I would not be here ! ( he reach into he pocket ) I have get it all itemize . ? 319 ? ( and he throw the paper on andrew ' desk ) andrews pick up the paper and glance at it . after a moment , he look at Peter , study he interestedly ; then he return to the paper , and read its content : " Cash outlay 8.60 topcoat 15.00 suitcase 7.50 hat 4.00 3 shirt 4.50 total 39.60 " andrew look up from the paper . this be a twist he have not anticipate , and he do not quite know how to handle it . peter ( now see closer with andrew ) I sell some drawer and sock , too ; I be throw that in . andrews and this be what you wantthirty - nine dollar and sixty cent ? peter why not ? I be not charge you for the time I waste . andrews yes , I knowbut peter what 's the matter ? be not it cheap enough ? a trip like that would cost you a thousand dollar ! andrews let I get this straight . you want this thirty - nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollar ? peter what ten thousand ? andrews the reward . peter ( sharply ) who say anything about a reward ! andrews ( smile ) I be afraid I be a little confuse . you see , I assume you be come here for peter ( impatiently ) all I want be thirty - nine sixty . if you will give I a check I will get out of this place . it give I the jitter . andrews you be a peculiar chap . ? 320 ? peter ( irritably ) we will go into that some other time . andrews the average man would go after the reward . all you seem to peter listen , do anybody ever make a sucker out of you ? this be a matter of principle . something you probably would not understand . ( he burn at the think ) when somebody take I for a buggy ride I do not like the idea of have to pay for the privilege . andrews you be take for a buggy ride ? peter yeahwith all the trimming . now , how about the check . do I get it ? a close - up indicate that andrews have be study Peter throughout the scene . he be now completely win over . andrews ( smile ) certainly . ( he open a checkbook and write it out ) while andrew write , Peter wander around the room in a attitude of bitter contempt . andrew rise and go to he . andrews here you be . ( as Peter take the check ) do you mind if I ask you something frankly ? ( Peter just look at he without respond ) do you love my daughter ? peter ( evasively , while fold the check ) a guy that would fall in love with you daughter should have he head examine . andrews that 's a evasion . peter ( put the check into a wallet ) she grab herself a perfect run mate . King westley ! the pill of the century ! ( pockete wallet ) what she need be a guy that would take a sock at she every daywhether it 's come to she or not . a close view of the two show andrew smile : here be a man ! peter if you have half the brain you be suppose to have , you would have do it yourselflong ago . ? 321 ? andrews do you love she ? peter ( go for he hat as he reply ) a normal human be could not live under the same roof with she , without go nut . ( go to the door ) she 's my idea of nothing ! andrews I ask you a question . do you love she ? peter ( snap it out ) yes ! ( as andrew smile ) but do not hold that against I . I be a little screwy myself . he snap the door open and go out , follow which andrews be see watch the door , he eye twinkle , and the scene cut to the downstair hallway as Peter come through , move on to the front door . but just as he reach it , ellie enter , accompany by half a dozen man and hold a cocktail in she hand . they see each other almost simultaneously , and both stop , glaring . peter ( look she over contemptuously ) perfect ! now you look natural . at this ellie leave she group and come toward Peter , and a close view show they together , glaring at each other . ellie ( icily ) I hope you get you money . peter you bet I do . ellie congratulation . peter same to you . ellie why do not you stay and watch the fun ? you will enjoy it immensely . peter I would . but I have get a weak stomach . he wheel around and go through the door , ellie look after he , she eye blaze . the drine of a plane motor outside be hear , and several people rush down the stair , all excited . guest here come King ! he 's just come down ! hurry up , everybody ! come on , ellie ! ? 322 ? immediately there be a general excitement , as guest hurry through the hallway on the way to the lawn . but ellen do not moveshe remain stare blankly at the door through which Peter go until andrew enter from he study . andrews I just have a long talk with he . ellen ( she voice break ) I be not interested . andrews now , wait a minute , ellie ellie ( sharply ) I do not want to hear anything about he ! she walk away from he , and andrew , frustrated , look at she helplessly . thereupon the scene dissolves to a full view of the lawn . the orchestra be play mendelssohn 's wedding March . the lawn be crowded with guest . in the background we see the autogyro idling . a closer view show a small platform , serve as a altar . over it there be a arbor of rose . back of the altar stand a minister , ready . a reverse view reveal a long , narrow , carpete pathway lead to the house . both side be line with guest , who be murmure excitedly . at the moment , King westley and he best man be march solemnly toward the altar . back of the altar we see a high platform upon which be several newsreel man who be grind they camera . the guest , of whom close glimpsis be catch , be now peer over each other 's shoulder . King and he best man have reach the altar , and the music of the wedding march come to a stop . the orchestra leader be look around , apparently wait for a signal . at the door of the house a very " prissy " middle - age man wave he handkerchief and nod he head to the orchestra leader . the orchestra leader acknowledge the signal by nodd he headsturn to he menuwave he baton , and the orchestra start play , " here come the bride . " '' the guest whisper to each other excitedly . a great deal of stir take place . the door of the house slowly opensand a parade of small flower girl emerge . they march , take each step carefully , while they strew flower along the path . they be well out of the way when ellie , on the arm of she father , appear in the doorway . a view of the guest show that they cannot contain themselves . murmur of " here she come , " and " do not she look beautiful ? " be hear . the newsreel man on they platform behind the altar bestir themselves . this be what they have be wait for ! ellie and she father ( see close ) now make they way to the altar . ellie 's face be solemn , and she jaw set . andrews ( whisper out of the side of he mouth ) you be a sucker to go through with this . ellie glance at he out of the corner of she eyeand quickly turn forward again . ? 323 ? andrews that guy warne be o.k . he do not want the reward . ellie keep she eye glue in front of she , remain expressionless . andrews all he ask for be thirty - nine dollar and sixty cent . . . that 's what he spend on you . it be a matter of principle with himqsay you take he for a ride . this register on ellie and she raise she eyesbut she reaction be only slightly perceptible . a close view of a group of guest show two girl look enviously in the direction of the bride . a young girl ( whisper ) I wish I be in she shoe . second girl yes . she certainly be lucky . ellie and she father be see again , and andrews be still whisper to she . andrews he love you , ellie . told I so . this bring a definite reaction , which she quickly cover up . andrews you do not want to be marry to a mug like westley . at this there be a close view of westleythere be a satisfied smirk on he face . andrews I can buy he off for a pot of gold , and you can make a old man happy , and you would not do so bad for yourself . if you change you mind , you car 's wait at the back gate . ellie give no indication of she intention . her face remain immobile . and now ellie and she father have reach the altar . the " prissy " man be place they in position . the big moment have arrive . the guest be all atwitter . but a close view of ellie show that she realize that she fate be close in on she . she look around for a mean of escape . minister ( start the ceremony ) dearly beloved , we be gather together here in the sight of God and in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony . if any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be join together , let he speak now or else hereafter forever hold he ? 324 ? peace . King , will thou have this woman to be thy wedd wife ? so long as ye both shall live ? king I will . minister ellen , will thou have this man to be thy wedd husband so long as ye both shall live ? then , see at the altar , ellie make she decision . she reach down , take a firm hold on she train and , push several people aside , run out of the scene . that at the altar look up , surprised , and the most startle of all be king himself . king ( call after she ) ellie ! he start to go after herbut find andrew in he way while the outcry of the guest rise in chorus . guest what 's happen ? where 's she go ? on the platform , the newsreel man , a look of astonishment on they face , decide to follow ellie . a man get she , Mac ! she 's ducking ! and , as view by the newsreel man , ellie be see in the distance dash through the gate . the guest stare dumbfounded . follow this , andrew and King be see together in the crowd . king ( helplessly ) what happen ? andrews ( blandly ) I have not the slight idea . but he mouth twitches as he try to keep from smile . as King run out of sight andrew get out a cigar and light ita happy smile on he face which he now do not try to conceal . outside the front gate ellie be see in a fast roadster , as she start away with a plunge . her eye sparkle . a crowd of people dash up , head by King . they stop dead when they see the car disappear . on the lawn the commotion run high , and the guest chatter they amazement . a close view of andrews show he smile with satisfaction . the scene dissolves to andrews ' office , where andrew be regaling himself with a whiskey and soda . he be in a pleasantly inebriated mood when he secretary enter . ? 325 ? andrews ( as he pick up the phone that have start ringing ) do not want to talk todo not want to talk to anybody . do not want to see anybody . secretary but it 's King westley on the phone . andrews ooooooh . ( into the phone ) hello my would - be ex-son- in - law . I have send you a check for a hundred thousand . yes . that 's the smartest thing you ever do , westley , not to contest that annulment . that 's satisfactory , be not it ? yeah . well , it ought to be . oh I be not complain . it be dirt cheap . ( as he hang up ) do not fall out of any window . secretary ( place a telegram on the desk ) there 's another wire from Peter , sir . they're in Glen Falls , Michigan . andrews ( read it ) " what 's hold up the annulment , you slow poke ? the wall of jericho be toppling . " ( to the Secretary ) send he a telegram right away . just say : " let them topple . " this dissolves to the exterior of a auto camp very much like the other camp at which Peter and ellie stay . the owner 's wife be talk to she husband . wife funny couple , be not they ? man yeah . wife if you ask I , I do not believe they be marry . man they be marry all right . I just see the license . wife they make I get them a rope and a blanket , on a night like this . man yeah ? ? 326 ? wife what do you reckon that 's for ? man blame if I know . I just brung them a trumpet . wife ( puzzle ) a trumpet ? man yeah . you know , one of that toy thing . they send I to the store to get it . wife but what in the world do they want a trumpet for ? man I dunno . the scene move to the cabin occupy presumably by Peter and ellie . the window be light . there be a blast from a trumpet , and as the light go out a blanket be see drop to the floor , and the scene fade out . the end
