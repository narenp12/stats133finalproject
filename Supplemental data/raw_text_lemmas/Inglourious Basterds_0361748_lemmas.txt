I just have a few question monsieur lapadite , if you can assist I with answer , my department can close the file on you family . take he black leather attache case , and place it on the table , he take out a folder from inside . he also extract a expensive black fountain pen from he uniform front pocket . open the folder , and refer to it ; col landa now before the occupation there be four jewish family in this area , all dairy farmer like yourself . the loveitt , the dolerac , the rollins , and the dreyfus 's , be that correct ? 8 , perrier to my knowledge that be the jewish family among the dairy farmer . - heer Colonel , would it disturb you if I smoke my pipe ? look up from he papers . col landa please , monsieur lapadite , it be you house , make yourself comfortable . the Farmer get up from the table , go to he shelf over the fireplace , and remove from it a wooden BOX that contain all the fixin to he pipe . he sit back down at the table with he Nazi guest . as the Farmer load the bowel of he pipe with tobacco , set a match to it , and begin slowly puffing , make it red hot , the s.s. Colonel study the papers in front of he . col landa now accord to this papers , all the jewish family in this area have be account for - except , the dreyfusis . somewhere in the last year it would appear they have vanish . which lead I to the conclusion that they have ether make good they escape , or someone be very successfully hide they . ( look up from he papers , across the table at the farmer ) what have you hear about the dreyfusis monsieur lapadite ? perrier only rumor - col landa - I love rumor ! fact can be so misleading , where rumor , true or false be often reveling . so monsieur lapadite , what rumor have you hear regard the dreyfusis ? the farmerlook at landa . i. col landa speak freely monsieur lapadite , I want to hear what the rumor be , not who tell they to you . the Farmer puff thoughtfully on he pipe . perrier again , this be just a rumor - but we hear the dreyfusis have make there way into Spain . col landa so the rumor you have hear have be of escape ? perrier yes . col landa be the lapadite and the dreyfusis friendly ? as the Farmer answer this question , the camera lower behind he chair , to the floor , past the floor , to a small area underneath the floorboard revealing ; five human being lie vertically underneath the farmer floorboard . this human being be the dreyfusis , who have live lie down underneath the dairy farmer house for the past year . but one could not call what the dreyfusis have do for the last year live . this family have do the only thing they could , hide from a occupy army that wish to exterminate they . perrier we be family in the same community , in the same bussiness . I would not say we be friend , but member of the same community , we have common interest . the s.s. Colonel take in this answer , seem to except it , then move to the next question . col landa have never meet the dreyfusis , would you confirm for I the exact member of the household and they name ? 10 . perrier there be five of they . the father , Jacob ... . wife , miram ... she brother , Bob ... col landa - how old be Bob ? perrier thirty - thirty one ? col landa continue . perrier and the child ... amo ... and shoshanna . col landa Ages of the child ? perrier amo - six - I believe . and shosanna , be fifteen or sixteen , I be not really sure . CUT to uxt - dairy farm - day the mother and she three daughter finish take the laundry off the clothes line . they can not hear anything go on inside . e three Nazi Soldiers watch the three daughter . sack to landa and perrier col landa well I guess that should do it . be begin gather up he papers , and put they back into he ttache case . the Farmer , cool as a cucumber , puff on he pipe . col landa however , before I go , could I have another glass of you delicious milk ? it . perrier but of course . Farmer stand up , go over to the ice box , and take out the aft of milk . as he walk over and fill the Nazi Colonel 's glass , german Officer talk . col landa monsieur lapadite , be you aware of the nickname the people of France have give I ? perrier I have no interest in such thing . col landa but you be aware of what they call I ? perrier I be aware . col landa what be you aware of ? perrier that they call you , " the Jew Hunter " . col landa precisely ! now I understand you trepidation in repeat it . before he be assassinate , heydrich apparently hate the moniker the good people of Prague bestow on he . actually why he would hate the name , " the hangman " , be baffling to I it would appear he do everything in he power to earn it . but I , on the other hand , love my unofficial title , precisely because I have earn it . as " the Jew Hunter " enjoy he fresh milk , he continue to theorize with the french farmer . col landa the feature that make I such a effective hunter of the Jews , be , as oppose to most german soldier , I can think like a jew . where they can only think like a german , or more precisely , a german soldier . now if one be to determine what attribute the german people share with a beast , it would be the cun and predatory instinct of a hawk . col landa ( con 't ) negro 's - gorilla 's - brain - lip - smell - physical strength - penis size . but , if one be to determine what attribute the jews share with a beast , it would be that of the rat . now the fuhrer and gobble propaganda have say pretty much the same thing . where we conclusion differ , be I do not consider the comparison a insult . consider for a moment , the world a rat life in . it 's a hostile world indeed . if a rat be to scamper through you front door right now , would you greet it with hostility ? perrier I suppose I would . col landa have a rat ever do anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward they ? perrier Rat 's spread disease , they bite people - col landa - unless some fool be stupid enough to try and handle a live one , rat do not make it a practise of bite human being . rat be the cause of the bubonic plague , but that be some time ago . in all you bear day , have a rat ever cause you to be sick a day in you life ? I purpose to you , any disease a rat could spread , a squirrel could equally carry . yet I assume you do not share the same animosity with squirrel that you do with rat , do you ? perrier no . col landa yet , they be both rodent 's , be they not ? and except for the fact that one have a big bushy tail , while the other have a long repugnt tail of rodent skin , they even rather look alike , do not they ? 13.6 perrier it be a interesting think , beer Colonel . col landa however , interesting as the think may be , it make not one bit of difference to how you feel . if a rat be to scamper through you door , this very minute , would you offer it a saucer of you delicious milk ? perrier probably not . col landa I do not think so . you do not like they . you do not really know why you do not like they . all you know be , you find they repulsive . ( let 's the metaphor sink in ) what a tremendously hostile world a rat must endure . yet , not only do he survive , he thrive . and the reason for this , be because we little foe have a instinct for survival and presavation second to none . and that monsieur , be what a jew share with a rat . consequently , a german soldier , conduct a search of a house suspect of hide jews . where do the hawk look ? he look in the barn , he look in the attic , he look in the cellar - he look everywhere , he would hide . but there be many place it would never occur to a hawk to hide . however the reason the fuhrer bring I off my alp in Austria , and place I in french cow country today , be because it do occur to I . because I be aware what tremendous feat human being be capable of once they abandon dignity . ( change tone ) May I smoke my pipe as well ? th e Farmer 's cool facade be little by little erode . perrier please , cononel , make yourself at home . 13 . the Jew Hunter , remove both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixing . the pipe , strangely enough , be a calabash , make from a " S " shape goard kith a yellow skin , make famous by sherlock holme . a the Nazi Colonel , busy himself with he smoking life , he ontinue to hold court at the frenchman table . col landa the other mistake the german soldier make be they severe handle of the citizen who give shelter and aid to the Jews . this citizen be not enemy of the state . they be simply confuse people , try to make some sense out of the madness war create . this citizen do not need punish . they simply need to be remind of they duty in war time . let 's use you as a example monsieur lapadite . in this war , you have find yourself in the middle of a conflict that have nothing to do with yourself , you lovely lady , or you cow - yet , here you be . so monsieur lapadite , let I purpose a question . in this time of war , what be you number one duty ? be it to fight the Germans in the name of France to you last breath ? or , be it to harass the occupy army to the best of you ability ? or , be it to protect the poor unfortunate victim of warfare who can not protect themselfs ? or , be you number one duty in this time of bloodsh , to protect that very beautiful woman who constitute you family ? the Colonel let the last statement stand . col landa that be a question monsieur lapadite . in this time of war , what do you consider you number one duty ? perrier to protect my family . col landa now , my job dictate , that I must have my man enter you home , and conduct a thorough search , before I can officially cross you family name off my list . col landa ( con 't ) and if there be any irregularity to be find , rest assure , they will be . that be unless , you have something to tell I that will make the conduct of a search unnecessary . ( pause ) I might add also , that any information that make the preforming of my duty easier , will not be meet with punishment . actually quite the contrary , it will be meet with reward . and that reward will be , you family will cease to be harass in anyway , by the german military during the rest of we occupation of you country . the Farmer , pipe in mouth , stare across the table at he german opponent . col landa you be shelter enemy of the state , be you not ? perrier yes . col landa you shelter they underneath you floorboard be not you ? perrier yes . col landa Point out to I the area 's where they hide . the Farmer point out the area 's on the floor with the dreyfusis be underneath . col landa since I have not hear any disturbance , I assume that while they listen , they do not speak english ? perrier yes . col landa I be go to switch back to french now , and I want you to follow my masquerade - be that clear ? perrier yes . Colonel landa stand up from the table , and switch to french say subtitled in english ; col landa monsieur lapadite , I thank you for milk , and you hospitably . I do believe we business here be do . the Nazi Officer open the front door , and silently motion for he son to approach the house . col landa Mademoiselle lapadite , I thank you for you time , we shant be bother you family any longer . yet the lapadite woman watch the Nazi soldier , machine gun at ready , approach the house . the Soldiers enter the doorway , col landa , silently point out area of the floor the Jews be hide under . col landa so , monsieur and Madame lapadite I bid you adieu . otion to the Soldiers with he index finger . wy tear up the wood floor with machine gun FIRE . the little farm house be fill with smoke , dust , splinter , scream , 0 ullet casing , and even alittle blood . with a hand motion from the Colonel , the Soldiers cut off they gunfire . the Colonel keep he finger in the air to indicate silence . underneath the floorboard the entire dreyfus family lay dead . except for sixteen year old $ hosanna , who miraculously escape be strike by the nazi 's bullet . with she dead family surround she , the young girl go for freedom ( represent by wire mesh vent ) . L landa ear movement underneath the floor , look down and see 's a shape wing forward between the plank in the floor . col landa it 's the girl . nobody move I '. T kicked open , the girl spring out . col landa ae he cross the floor , he see 's the young girl running towards the cover of the wood . he unlatch the window , and open it . shosanna to perfectly framed in the window sill . 1 sanna running towards wood . farm house and col in the window in b.g . lthy barefeet lapping against wet grass . qt! shosannma ' S face same as a animal be chase by a predator flight - panic - fear snosanna's Pov the safety of tree 's , get closer . col landa prame by the window , take he lugar , and straight arm aim at the flee Jew , cock back the hammer with he thumb . cu col landa slow zoom into he eye as he aim . profile cu shosanna sod dash for life . L landa change he mind . he yell to the rat flee the trap , head for the safety of the wood pile , in french subtitled in english ; col landa au revoir , shosanna ! till we meet again ! hosanna mace it to the wood , and be go . T h e s.s. Colonel close the window . 17 . ext - nazi town car ( moving ) - day diihe ac seat of the convertible , that 'sa stsn tcolonel han Lan speed away from the french farm house . landa speak to he Driver in german , subtitled into english ; col landa herman , I sense` a question on you lip ? out with it ? driver why do yoy allow a enemy of the state to escape ? col landa oh , I do not think the state be in too much danger , do you ? driver I suppose not . col landa I be glad you see it my way . besides , not put a bullet in the back of a fifteen year old girl , and allow she to escape , we not nessessarlly the same thing . she 's a young girl , no food , no shelter , no shoe , who 's just witness the massacre of she entire family . she may not survive the night . and after word spread about what happen today , it 's highly unlikely she will find any willing farmer to extend she aid . if I have to guess she fate , I would say she will probably be turn in by some neighbour . or , she will be spot by some german soldier . or , we will find she body in the wood , dead from starvation or exposure . or , perhaps - she will survive . she will elude capture . she will escape to America . she will move to New York city . where she will be elect , President of the United States . the s.s.
