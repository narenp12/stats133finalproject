Theory one favour a male team , all big and butch , armed to the tooth . Theory two favour a female team . less propensity to violence . and so far , the male team have be shit out of luck . lena look at thorensen . see this be for real . lena they really think the previous expedition might have kill each other ? thorensen it 's a little more than they just ' think 's it . you know there 's a guy who make it back ? the only one . they have get he in a induce coma in the mo center . lena Â«+. I do hear that . thorensen so technically he be not the first to walk out of Area X . he be the second . lena frown . lena the second ? 38 . thorensen hand lena she binocular , then gesture out across the deforested area towards the tree line . thorensen check you ten o'clock , about twenty metre from the tree line . lena raise the binocular and look where thorensen have indicate . see a bundle of rag and white bone . at this distance , the bleach dome of skull be the only thing that allow we to understand it be a human . thorensen ( cont âd ) see the bone ? lena +. yes . thorensen he 's be laid there about six month now . too far away to positively id , but from he uniform , they know he be on the previous mission . flashback to - ext . the shimmer / treeline - day - long lens on the tree . a man walk out . unarm . wearing the spec ops uniform . through the mirage distortion , he seem to have a long beard . thorensen ( 0.s. ) just stroll out the forest one day . even at this distance , the man seem slightly daze . or uncertain . thorensen ( 0.s. ) ( cont 'd ) do not seem in a hurry . stood a while . start walk . the man take a few step in the direction of the distant wall . thorensen ( 0.s. ) ( cont âd ) then - rapid puff of red from the man 's head and chest . noiseless . 39 . thorensen ( 0.s. ) ( cont 'd ) - pop . follow by the delay crack of the rifle retort . cuT to - ext . southern reach facility / viewing platform - day - lena , lowering the binocular . lena -+. no one see who do it . thorensen shake she head . thorensen no . but we all get we idea . lena look at thorensen . wait . thorensen ( cont âd ) well - it 's get to have be the guy that get out , right ? the one they be keep in the freeze box . beat . thorensen ( cont âd ) Lieutenant kane . on lena , processing this .

I be about to make the exact same point . lena would you like I to explain what it mean ? kane I would . because I find it arouse when you patronise I . lena it mean the cell do not grow old and die . it become immortal . kane do not stop . lena we see the process of grow old as somehow natural . whereas in fact , it 's fault in we gene . we inherite it , but we do not need it , or want it .

Â«++. and become form . organic . embed into the rock like fossil . first , there be fractal plant shape . leaf , branch , fern . then , in the flora , there be animal . the pattern armour of a alligator , or its tooth , of the fat swirl of tail . the snout and claw of a bear . the curl of snake . the feather imprint of bird wing . and then - we start to see human . a torso . a arm . a face , try to push out from between the other form . or finger tip , stretch out , as if try to grab or be grab . the tunnel have become a tableau . a boil sea of people and creature - meld and freeze in black marble . 115 . Animal into plant . Plant into human . human into animal . and then - â movement . treacle slow , but unambiguous . no longer freeze . no longer fossil . the wall be alive . or the thing inside they be not dead . and at the moment of that realisation - - the tunnel suddenly stop , and open out into a chamber . int . under the lighthouse / chamber - continuous the chamber be roughly semi-spherical . Three quarter of a sphere , with the bottom levell out into a floor . the sculpt form of human and animal continue across the floor , but as they rise up the wall they taper into curve point . either side of this point , the wall be glassy smooth . the arrangement be similar to petal , as if we be on the inside of flower before it have unfurl . the interior of a vast lotus bulb . the very center of the chamber be particularly bright - because it be to here that the phosphorescent vein and channel all lead . and stand on this brightest point - - be dr ventress . the doctor be internally light . cilia cover she skin like undulate fur . she shimmer gently . lena hesitates in the entrance . she look around . up at the petal structure . down at the energy feed beneath dr ventress . then back to the glow figure of the doctor . lena take a step inside the chamber . lena Â«+. Doctor ventress ? 116. dr ventress turn to lena . she have the same expression as kane when he appear back home . Alzheimer 's -like . in she eye there be confusion . but through the confusion , a vibrate sense of fear . lena ( cont 'd ) Dr ventress - what 's happen to you ? dr ventress hesitates . as if half - remember . dr ventress I have to know what it be . what be wait .

I do not know what it want . I do not know what it want from I . the cilia on she palm move like wind over a wheat field . dr ventress ( cont âd ) I think it do not want anything . it do not care . it do not feel anything . 117 . as she talk , something disturbing begin to happen to dr ventress . split , complex fissure , start rippling across she skin . as if she form be become unbalance . she can feel it . the panic be rise in she voice . dr ventress ( cont âd ) it 's more than death . nothing of what we be will remain . it 's go to annihilate we . that 's what it be . that 's what 's wait . it 's annihilation . dr ventress look back at lena desperately . panic now surging . dr ventress ( cont âd ) annihilation . then dr ventress can not speak any more . she have start undergo a extraordinary physical transformation . it be a shape-shift of a kind that we mind cannot entirely make sense of - like a computer animation of a four dimensional shape casting a three dimensional shadow . a vector cube that unfold and refold from within itself , its interior indefinably become its exterior . in this case - it be the doctor 's skin that be unfold and refolding . her face split open like a starfish . from out of the starfish , multiple circle of radiating object emerge . gold orb , each with unique radiating mandelbrot - like fern . the rainbow fern radiate ever- increase size and complexity . the concentric circle be endless . the sense of expansion become vast . until the mesh of immense structural detail become - - the mesh of undulate cilia on skin . but dr ventress be go . where she stand , there be a shape . the alien . 118 . a be . a uncoalesce , fracture form . make of light , and ice , liquid . Endless refraction . glimpse within this deliquesc shape , a creature from the world of electron microscope image . surrounded by radiating impression of infinitely smaller version of itself . lena and the be gaze at each other for a few hypnotic second . then the be start unfolding again . expand , collapse in on itself . and this time , during the transformation - - we see fleeting glimpsis of other body and face . sheppard and thorensen . peyton and mayer . unknown team member from the previous expedition . for a moment it be radek who stand in front of lena . then dr ventress again . then the radiating shape have fill the chamber . they surround lena . then lena herself be start to unfold . unravel like fabric . lena no - through this - - she lift she gun . like a dream - - which shatter , the moment she squeeze the trigger and fire . bullet slam into the be . the round have a amazing effect . where they hit the body , a hole expands , like a bullet into ballistic gelatine - but do not contract . where they penetrate the body , they leave bright trail of emerald light , like sunlight through dust mote . for a moment , the be be poise in this state . hugely misshapen . spear with brilliant green . then it expand . transform . and resolves - - into a humanoid figure . sexless . featureless . have the arm , leg , of a human - man or woman . but nothing else . no eye , or mouth , or nose , or muscle form . lena be transfix by the sight . the figure turn to lena . and we see its smooth facial area . internally cover the skin like undulate fur , shimmeri : a beat , between the woman and the humanoid . lena â's weapon be out . she have no more clip . she start to run . the humanoid observe she run . then it start to follow she . the first step be slow . the second faster . the third be as fluid and powerful as lena . it start sprinting . int . under the lighthouse / tunnel - continuous lena sprint back up the tunnel . stumble over the shifting meld animal / human crash to the ground . scramble back up . cur to - - the humanoid . in pursuit . 119 . head and torso light . cilia no gently . shape . 120. and we see something strange happen . where lena fall and trip - - the humanoid do exactly the same thing . falling in the same place . in the same way . a simulacrum of lena 's action . cur to - - lena , reach the tunnel exit . climb back up into the base of the lighthouse . int . lighthouse - continuous lena scramble across the room - - towards the door to the lighthouse . but she do not make it . the humanoid simply appear in front of she , before she reach the door . it be unclear how it get there . a freeze beat . then lena strike the humanoid with all she strength . and moment later , in a mirror of she action - - the humanoid strike her back - but with incredible power . lena be send fly backwards across the room . she collide with the camera and tripod . all skid across the room to the wall . but it have provide lena with a weapon . as the humanoid reapproach she , she pick up the tripod and swing it like a club , smash the camera against the humanoid 's head . and again , the humanoid mirror the action . use its arm like a club . for a second time , lena be send hurtle back across the room by the force of the impact . but this time towards kanea backpack . she collide with it , and the phosphorous grenade beside it . 121 . and as she get to she foot , the humanoid be again on she . stand directly in front of she . featureless , eyeless , but somehow watch . utterly , infinitely more powerful than she be . for the first time , we see something beat in lena . something break . lena please - she expect a kill blow . and flinch - - and the humanoid do the same . lena see . she immediately realise what we already know . the humanoid be mimick she . she be fight herself . we can see she think : can this be true . the kill blow still have not come . lena lift a hand . finger tremble with adrenaline and fear . and the humanoid 's opposite hand also rise . she pause . the humanoid 's hand pause . lena 's hand start move again . until - - she touch its cheek . a exact mirror of the gesture where she touch kane be face at the start of the film , when he appear at they bedroom at home . a beat . then the humanoid raise its hand . lena hold motionless , suspend , except for tight breathe and trickle bead of sweat , as the softly glow hand lift to she face ... --. then - - lightly touch she cheek also . 122. and as it do so - - the humanoid start another folding transformation . rippling , fold , collapse . and this time , resolve itself as kane . lena gasp . for a moment , the two face each other . then lena open she mouth to speak . lena ( cont 'd ) ... kane ? beat . kane kane ? another beat . reveal - at lena 's foot - the phosphorous grenade . close , on lena . Processing . control herself . then - slowly - - she reach down . opposite she , in a slightly delay mirror action - - kane do the same . lena 's hand close around one of the metal cannister . kane do the same . lena rise again . never take she eye off kane 's face . kane rise . a final beat . lena watch kane 's face . lena ( whisper ) I be sorry . then lena pull the pin . kane mirror . Soft tick from the cannister . 123. second pass . lena ( cont 'd ) ( breathes ) five , four , three , two â then - lena drop the grenade - - and throw herself sideways . kane 's head turn , see - - but he 's too late to fully react . lenar phosphorous grenade detonate . and a moment later , so do kane be . the interior of the lighthouse be suddenly illuminate by stark white light . the route to the exit be block by the blaze . lena scramble for the stair that spiral up to the top of the lighthouse . climb upwards . beneath she be light and smoke . in the brightness , we can glimpse the shadow shape of the humanoid / kane - shape-shift in silhouette . int . lighthouse / top - day lena have reach the top - a semi-circular balcony around the old housing for the lamp . below she be a fifty foot drop to the burn interior of the lighthouse . the whole wooden structure of the building be start to burn . she kick out a window . the jump to the ground look lethal . the lighthouse be ringed with a concrete platform . the only hope might be the sloping sand dune , just beyond the ring of concrete , which could take the deadly impact out of the fall . but the fire behind do not give she a choice . within a minute , she option will only be to jump or burn . 124. lena take a step back , to give herself the chance to run at the window , and propel herself through with enough force to reach the dune . but as the step back , she jolt . and turn . the humanoid be directly behind she . it 's burn . horribly damage . lock into jittering transformation , none of which can quite resolve . shadows of human and creature and alien form flicker across it . all in expression of agony . it be a truly nightmarish sight . reflexively , lena scream . in its break mirror state , the humanoid also scream . a maw appear where a mouth might be . then , as if with a final effort , it make a final transformation â - and resolve into lena . a literal mirror image . down to the finest detail . they stance mirror each other . they be dress identically . they be smear with blood identically . and we have literally no way of tell who be who . a freeze beat . then one lena lunge at the other . strike . Impacts . and one lena topple backwards , over the edge of the balcony - fall down into the phosphorous blaze . the other watch . tight on her face . as she watch herself fall . blank. 125. held . face illuminate by the bleach light . there be no clear indication as to which lena live , and which lena die . ext . lighthouse - sundown wide on the burn lighthouse . Long flame curl from the top window , into a plume of dark smoke . the sun be set , and be cluster with the psychedelic colour refraction we always see through the shimmer . except that something be clearly happen . the movement and vibration of the shimmer be settling . and the colour be become less intense . then all along the beach , the sand structure start collapse . first one , then three , then seven . then all together . wind collect they as they fall . and as they fall , they reveal a figure walk across the sand towards we . lena . cuT to - ext . southern reach facility / viewing platform - sundown - the view platform of the Southern reach facility , where people be exite from the mess hall . excitedly gather to look at the view over the scrubland to the tree-line ... .+. where the shimmer be now clearly melting away . and the refraction be reverting to the blue , red and orange of a normal , beautiful sunset . pull back . Wide . then CUT to - 126. ext . the night sky - night - a STAR -field in a night sky . dense constellation . the milky Way . drift down . past the moon . to the southern reach facility . and a lone woman walk out of the tree line , across the scrubland towards it . lena . lena ( 0.s. ) I want to see my husband . cuT to - int . southern reach facility / medical ward - night - a medical ward . lena be walk down it , with a doctor alongside , and two spec ops soldier follow . doctor it be miraculous . it happen the same night that the shimmer disappear . his blood pressure stabilise , and he pulse rate start to rise . by the next morning , he be not only awake . he be lucid . coherent . they have reach a door in the ward . through the glass panel , lena can see kane inside . sitting at a chair . gazing out of the window . doctor ( cont 'd ) there 's no trace of abnormality anywhere in he system . lena I would like to see he alone . int . southern reach facility / ward room - continuous lena enter . close the door behind she . 127 . kane look round , and they lock eye . neither speak . after a moment , lena go to the window . look out at the night sky . lena be you kane ? silence . then kane give a slight shake of the head . kane I do not know . beat . kane ( cont 'd ) be you lena ? lena hesitates . then turn to face he . behind her - - we can see through the window to the night sky . and in that sky , we see a shoot STAR . then another . then another . cuT to - int . lower atmosphere - night - the shoot star as falling meteor . as we see in the open image of the film . a hunk of rock , burn as it fall through Earth 's atmosphere . and as the nearest meteor split apart , we see in its core . something shimmer .
