CUT to : t.v. image from time to time we cut to the live ( film ) version of this same image . when we be live , we also see reaction from Veronica . brundle be be interview in close - up ; veronica speak off-camera . veronica ( oc : we have just see the first teleportation of a human be . Dr. Seth brundle , how do it feel go through ? what do it feel like ? brundle ( on tape : it feel like a stutter . veronica : a what ? brundle : a stutter . a hiccup . a slight dislocation of my physical life . not unpleasant . just a little interuption of rhythym . for a second I think it do not work . I think I be in the same telepod I start out in . veronica ( oc ) : and do you feel at all different ? brundle ( on tape ) : a little ... unbalance . that 's all . veronica ( oc ) : and now ? brundle ( on tape ) I should feel exactly the same as before , but I do not . I be not complain . I feel very co-ordinate . and very energize . I feel as though I work better , physically . everthing seem to just - work together better than it ever do before . veronica ( oc ) : why should that be ? brundle ( on tape ) : it 's possible that the teleporter have somehow ... improve I . veronica ( oc ) : but that 's fantastic ! how be it possible ? brundle ( on tape ) : in reassembling I it might have - this be just a guess - but it might have just - see where thing could be improve - theoretically , and it do it . I tell it to be creative , and I guess it have be . veronica ( oc ) : could this ever be dangerous ? brundle : well , it 's certainly unexpected . the monkey have not show any change from they norm . we will see when they come back from testing . veronica : you still have not answer I . could this ever be dangerous ? brundle ( on tape ) : it feel too perfect to be dangerous . veronica : you like the way it feel ? brundle ( on tape ) : yes , I do .

Veronica notice that brundle have fill he cup almost to the top with sugar . veronica do you normally take coffee with you sugar ? brundle what ? heh . you know I just do not think I have ever give I , a chance to be I . but , of course interestingly , and the exact same moment that I achieve what will probably prove to be my life 's work , that 's the moment when I start be the real I finally . listen , not to wax messianic . it may be true that the synchronicity of that two event might blur the resultant individual effect of either individual . but it be nevertheless it be also certainly true , I will say now however subjectively ; that human teleportation , molecular decimation , breakdown and reformation be inherently purging . it make a man a King . from the moment I walk out of the pod I feel like a million buck . you know , I think I be gonna have a cemoli after all . waiter ! I mean , what a accomplishment . but , what have I really do ? all I have do be say to the world , " let go , move . catch I if you can " . waiter .

CUT to : brundle be sit at he computer with a pair of glove on . brundle give I a disc . I need the first teleportation : S. brundle the computer show the log of Seth 's first teleportation , which also show a second object in the telepod . when brundle ask what the secondary object be , the computer reply " secondary element be ..... not - brundle " . brundle run sequence . the computer run through several scan of the " secondary element " , and it become clear that it be a fly . brundle ask the computer , through type , what happen to the fly . the Computer soon respond with , " Fusion " . brundle finally ask if he absorb and assimilate the fly . the Computer tell he ; " negative , Fusion of brundle and fly at molecular genetic level . " int . ronnie apartment - night veronica hello ? brundle ( mumble ) veronica Seth ! Seth , I have be try to reach you . where be you ? brundle for the last four week I have be afraid to see you . now , I be afraid not to . veronica where be you ? be you at home ? brundle Veronica . you do not know how right you be .

I be not pure . veronica I do not know what you mean . brundle a fly get into the transmitter pod with I that first time when i be alone . uh , the computer get confuse ; there be not suppose to be two separate genetic pattern and it decide to splice we together . it mate we , I and the fly . we have not even be properly introduce . my teleporter turn she into a gene splicer . and a very good one . now I be not Seth brundle anymore . I be the offspring of , um , brundle and housefly . veronica oh , God ! Veronica move closer to brundle , who jump up from he seat . brundle no . veronica oh , God ! brundle please . veronica Seth ! brundle you look so pretty . veronica what will happen ? brundle sit back down in another chair . brundle oh , I think it 's show itself as a bizarre form of cancer . veronica what ? brundle and general cellular chaos and revolution .

I just , I do not know ... int . brundle lab - night we be close on brundle 's finger as they dance over the key of the computer keyboard . brundle have cut the finger off a pair of yellow rubber kitchen glove and jamme they down over he fingertip , so that he finger will not stick to the keyboard . cu monitor which read : gene-splicing program now in place telepod 1 : transmitter pod subject a telepod 2 : transmitter pod subject B telepod 3 : receiver pod for genetically fuse a-b combination subject we pull back to see that in front of brundle and he keyboard stand not two , but three telepod , the third one of a somewhat older and more handbuilt vintage than the other two - the original prototype telepod which have be sit in a corner of the lab under a tarpaulin and be notice by Veronica on she first visit to the lab . in telepod a sit a monkey , in telepod B a alley cat . telepod C , the old prototype receiver , be empty . brundle operate the machine . the monitor say , ready for fusion brundle press the accept button . the telepod go through they normal disintegration routine as the animal ' outline appear on the monitor in split screen fashion . but now , as the reintegration process begin , a stream of data concern this new experiment , the fusion of monkey and cat , flood the screen . the basic message that get across to we through all the hi-tech compu-talk be : percentage of monkey-63 percentage of cat -37 this number fluctuate as the machine try to strike a molecular balance between the two creature . finally , a outline of the fuse creature begind to form on the screen . brundle look up to see the actual creature form , and it be indeed grotesque : two head - one monkey , one cat - at odd angle to each other , six leg which be not quite symmetrically place on the monkey torso , cat tail . as the creature solidify and the light go off , it sit there in the telepod for a moment , half - recline as though crippled . brundle get up , go to the third telepod , and with great apprehension , open the door . the thing just sit there , slump for a beat , then suddenly leap up at he , its two head shreiking ! it jump on he arm , cling , snarling , then drop to the floor . the two head begin to bite each other , blood begin to flow - the thing now run around in mad floppy circle , smear blood everywhere . brundle be horrify . he grab a metal rod lean in a corner and begin to smash at the deform thing . he keep smash at it until it stop its hideous screeching and lie dead , mangle on the floor . brundle wrap it up in a towel and throw it into the refrigerator . he draw the old tear sheet over the third telepod so he do not have to look at it again . back at the monitor , the screen be flash the word : fusion successful receiver telepod 3 brundle put he face in he hand for a few moment , then pull himself together . he pull the rubber fingertip off he finger and throw they to the ground . brundle have now develop some insect - like tics and mannerism , he head twitching with nervous little jerk and he long finger in constant motion . we see clearly now that all of brundle 's fly characteristic have be accentuate even further . the metallic-green hair which completely cover he face be much thicker than before , and the hernia-like bulge in he side be more protuberant now , stretch to the burst point and obviously cause brundle some pain . brundle look at the skylight . the sky be clear , the moon be a scimitar . on a impulse , he jump up on the wall , stick there for a beat . then , with incredible agility , he ascend the wall , cross the celing toward the skylight . on the ceiling brundle glide on all four , upside down , towards the skylight . once there , he crawl into it and open it up . ext . lab rooftop -night brundle clamber out of the skylight onto the roof . the night be gorgeous , clean and bright , the sky pack with star . brundle breathes deeply . he be still alive , be not he ? he can still respond to the beauty of the night , can not he ? ext . montage - brundle's travel - night we follow brundle on he solitary sojourn in a montage sequence . he climb wall with amazing ability , leap from rooftop to rooftop , hang upside down from ledge and lamppost , eavesdropp on the city life around and below he , the inhabitant unaware of the unusual and shadowy observer in they midst . he scurries along the girder of a bridge , gaze down on the traffic and the river below he . this moment should be poetic , even beautiful , joyous . the moon be luminous , the dark night exquisite . resigned to he fate and momentarily forgetful of he future , brundle seem to be reveling in he unique power . a brief euphoric fling . dissolve to : brundle leap across a narrow alleyway to the wall of the building opposite he . he smile with smug satisfaction at he feat , then suddenly wince , grab he side with one of he hand . we hear a cracking , splitting SOUND . brundle muffle a startle cry , and lose he balance , slide several foot down the wall before regain hold . he look down at the huge bulge in he side and see that it be start to split open ! brundle be horrify and in pain . he start to quickly move down the side of the building but the pain impede he progress . he manage to get down at least another floor before he 's hit with another sharp pain . he double up and he tenuous grip on the wall cause he to slide another several foot downward before he regains he grip . the side be gape wide now and something be start to protrude . brundle be in shock . another ripple of pain cause he to release he grasp entirely and he fall to the ground in a dirty narrow alley , where he writhes in pain , as a strange , hairy sticklike appendage --actually the beginnings of a flylike leg -- begin to unfold awkwardly out of he side . despite he excrutiate pain , brundle watch with fixate , wide - eye terror at he latest transformation ! the insect leg now begin to probe around , function like a real leg , almost with a mind of its own . grotesque as brundle have become , he can not accept the next step towards real insectness which this new leg represent . he scream at the leg . brundle ( scream at the leg ) no ! no , I will not ! I will not , I will not , I will not ..! brundle grab at the leg , hold it , subdue it and then begin to gnaw at it with he tooth at its base , twist himself into a agonize ball in order to do it . the leg begin to lever at he back , small hooklike protrusion all along its underside catch in the flesh of brundle 's back , tear it in protest against brundle 's attempt at amputation . finally , brundle have severe the leg with he tooth . the leg drop off leave a strand or two of stringy gristle hang from the knobby stump in brundle 's side . the leg twitches on the ground , try to extend itself . brundle look at the leg in shock , he eye craze , like a animal who have be catch in a leg-trap and have have to gnaw off the leg to be free . brundle try to steady himself , then stagger away down the alley . as he go , he wipe the insect blood from he lip with he two forearm in exactly the same way that fly clean they face . ext . the hospital - day Veronica be wheeled into a Hospital with stathis by she side int . the hospital - day Veronica , with stathis still by she side , be wheeled down a corridor by a orderly . veronica stathis , I be scared . stathis it 's go to be all right ronnie . it 's go to be fine . veronica I do not think I want to loose it . be there something wrong with I ? why be I loose it ? stathis it 's better this way ronnie , you will see . it 's the best thing that could happen . int . operating room - day Veronica be laid on the table surround by nurse , as well as stathis and the gynacologist . gynacologist okay , she 's expel it . yeah it 's come out .
