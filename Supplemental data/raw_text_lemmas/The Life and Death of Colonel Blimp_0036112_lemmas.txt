' the slot allocate indicate a anticipate length of about 130 minute . * one of this be donate by Powell and the other by rank , apparently in the late 5as . I be grateful for this and other information about version to David meeker , keeper of feature film at the National Film and Television Archive . when , how often , and by how much be blimp cut ? this be the question which still lack definitive answer , but some reliable evidence and explanation can now be give . the US motion picture Almanac list blimp for three consecutive year , from 1944 - 45 to 1946 - 47 , as belong to ' archer - General ' and at its original length of 163 minute .* Correspondence in the Powell papers indicate that there be considerable speculation about how to release it in the United States ; but despite the plea of specialist independent dis - tributor , it be eventually assign to United artist under rank 's overall deal with that company , and release by it in May 1945 . the run time list in the motion picture Herald review of 24 March 1945 be 148 minute and the title be give as Colonel blimp . four year later , blimp resurface in the trade press with a report that rank have initiate action by the Federal Trade Commission to restrain ua from show a version of 91 minute , cut from the ' original ' of 143 minute . + the outcome , it be stress , be academic , since the film ' have be out of circulation for over a year ' . by the early 5as , it appear that either the US version have become the only one available in Britain , or that the film have be further shorten - possibly in order to fit into a double-bill . running time of 140 and 120 minute have be quote by various source . all of this shorten version ( if there be more than one ) seem to have have the prologue remove , so that the action start in 1902 and move forward to the turkish bath in 1942 - 43 . this , at any rate , be the version that I first see in a nitrate print in 1971 , but unfortunately do not time . in 1976 , the bfi deposit Collection be hand over to the National Film Archive , which take the opportunity to ' cannibalize ' the three print it now hold , make a nitrate view copy of some 160 minute . this be first see publicly in 1978 at the fiaf Congress in Brighton and at the National Film theatre 's Powell - pressburger retrospective in October - November 1978 . a first phase of restoration then start , with support from the BBC , to make a printable safety negative , base on the original technicolor separation . the result be unsatisfactory technically , but capable of be enhance electronically for a tv transmission on 11 October 1980 , bill as allow the film to be ' see tonight on television for the first time in its full original version ' . work continue at the nfa , supervise by Paul de burgh and with help from the rank Film laboratory and a grant from the sainsbury charitable trust , which result in a new safety negative . this provide the basis of a reissue of the film by bfi distribution in 1985 , after a gala screen at the screen on the Hill on 18 July , attend by Powell and pressburger . it have be use as the basis for annotate the original script . * rank 's original distributor , General , still exist in the US ; and the archer seem also to have be active in try to place they film . hence this ' hold ' designation . + motion picture Herald , 15 January 1949 ; kinematograph weekly , 13 January 1949 , P. 22 . geoffrey macnab refer to this report , but claim in he J. Arthur rank and the british Film Industry ( London , 1933 ) that the film be reduce 'to only a little over a tidy hour ' , thereby add further confusion to a already tangle tale . . fade in field message : [ [ from : corp commander to : all unit 16:00 hour message begins exercise beer-mug time cafe do paris message end 10 JUNE ( add in pencil at the bottom : ' make it like the real thing ' and initialled by the c.o . ] ] [ 4 be bmi date : Beer mug stop butterfly 23.59 hour ] dissolve to : sequence 1 a series of shot , compose and edit , to produce the maximum effect of speed , efficiency and modern equipment . location must be choose roughly between staine and elstree , along line of the Green belt and the arterial road , give composite impression of the approach to West London . some air-shot will be necessary . the intention be to create , as simply as possible , a impression of the mechanization and resource of the modern british Army . exterior : despatch rider a small army of motorcycle despatch rider , several hundred of they , be tear along a arterial road at full speed . at a roundabout they divide into three column , one go right , another leave , the third straight on . we follow the third column . the by-pass end at a t-road . the column divide again , one column west , the other east .
