Quick ! the private join in reluctantly , and they hoist another thick plank into place , hold it in position while the corporal hammer a nail through one end . 2 . a creak -- and dust begin to spill from the roof . the corporal carry on regardless , nailing the other end . but the private be still inquisitive . private nobody out there 's get a clue what 's go on . with why be we do this ? sergeant because we have be order to ! be not that enough for you ? another plank be lift into place , and the barricade be near completion ... then the distant clatter of the generator falter . the light dim -- then brighten again as the generator return to its previous steady rhythm . the two nco 's freeze -- hold they breath -- look at each other with speechless expectation . the generator splutter again -- terminally , this time . they let go of the plank , and it crash to the floor . scrabble for they torch , start to panic . the private watch bemuse as the other two curse under they breath . the generator noise be now on a rapid downward curve , slow and die . the light be go with it ... ... and a solid , shocking blackness drop on they with sudden silence . they torch be on but the beam be feeble , struggle to penetrate the darkness . the sergeant can not help himself : sergeant ( cont would ) oh , Christ ! his voice echoes away into the darkness . private the generator 's just out of petrol . what 's so -- corporal shhh ! a pause ... then , from the side - tunnel , come a new noise : a faint scuffling sound . 3 . they automatically shine they torch at the barricade they fear tangible now -- affect even the young private , whose cocky expression of disdain be rapidly drop from he face . the sergeant 's voice be tight : sergeant it 's happen ! just like they say ! private what be it ? be someone in there ? but the other two be already back away along the tunnel in horrify disbelief . the private begin to follow after they , he nervousness grow by the second ... the scuffling get louder ... private ( cont have ) for God 's sake , what be it ? what 's in there ? but the other two turn and run . louder still ...! and as he composure finally crumble and he run after they , the private look back over he shoulder one last time -- he face now betray a expression of sheer terror ... CUT to black : front title fade in : ext . forest - german border , december 1944 - day densely pack pine tree in all direction . snowflake flutter down silently from a steel - grey sky . a german Army supply lorry crawl along a dirt road which wind through the forest , engine racing and wheel spin as it slither through the river of mud churn up by a hundred tank and vehicle long go . accompany it be a score of infantry , breath plume in the frosty air . some trudge alongside the lorry , offer a shoulder occasionally to straighten it as it fishtail through the slush . the remainder follow twenty yard behind . each be sagging under the weight of helmet , equipment and sodden greatcoat . they uniform mark they as regular army -- but they coat carry the black and silver cuff - band of a ' elite 's division . 4 . engel , head up the group of straggler , reach into he bread - bag and pull out a half - eat bar of chocolate . he pop a piece into he mouth , and chomp it wearily . follow in he wake be ebert , schenke , kreuzmann , baumann , heydrich , unit medic franke , and c.0. , lo. krupp . we â€™1ll get to know each of they soon enough . two or three other make up the number -- but we group of eight be the main player for now . engel they x11 be head on to Brussels without we , at this rate . Ebert , move with a lithe , cat - like alertness despite he tiredness , throw engel a idle sideways glance . ebert what 's you hurry ? schenke ( a snort , but in ) well , it 's not to win any medal that 's for sure . engel ignore schenke 's comment , and respond to Ebert 's question . engel what 's the hurry ? have a guess . ebert ( bored ) the woman . engel God , no ! they be like french woman - coarse hair and wide - pore skin . next guess . heydrich -- older than the rest , a veteran -- chip in . heydrich surely not the booze ? engel ( shaking head ) Nah ! cat 's piss , all of it . ( to they all ) any more ? engel look around -- but nobody else be interested except kreuzmann , who be look to he eagerly for the answer engel glance around once more , then sigh in defeat . engel ( cont have ) only two good thing ever come out of Belgium : one 's the road to Germany , and the other ... engel snap off a chunk of chocolate , and toss it back to kreuzmann with a wink and a warm smile . kreuzmann quickly tear off the remain wrapper with nervy finger . kreuzmann chocolate ! engel cock he head appreciatively . engel get it . you can say what you like , but they make damned good -- a bullet smack into engel 's throat , blow a chunk out of he neck as it exit . the distant rifle shot follow a second behind . almost simultaneously , a demolition charge explode under the lorry ahead , take the leg off the accompany troops . the front end of the vehicle heave into the air and crash back down in a smoking ruin . the group scatter as a hail of sniper FIRE rain down : heydrich catch a bullet in the leg , and he and Ebert head forward and leave off the road ; baumann take a gully several yard back , also to the leave ; schenke , kreuzmann , krupp and franke dive right . the rest take cover as best they can . engel , paralyse , drop to he knee in the mud . hand at he throat stemm the stream of blood . jaw work to speak , but only produce gurgle . he 's hit again , in the shoulder , but still remain upright . kreuzmann ( a scream ) get he out of there ! but all attention be focuss forward as the rest of the unit swing into action in unison , settling behind cover to return FIRE with well - practise precision . with bullet spitting down all around , it 's all they can do to stay put . . while they legless , die comrade scream in the b.g. heydrich & ebert snuggle into cover across the road , heydrich drag he injure leg painfully . shock and confusion show on they pale face . ebert how bad 's the leg ? heydrich simply shake he head , more concerned about engel , who 's still propped up on he knee in the kill - zone . heydrich we need to give engel some cover fire - see if someone can get to he . ebert angle 's wrong from here . sniper - fire 's come from up leave somewhere . heydrich what about retreate to that gully back there ...? someone burst through the bush suddenly behind they -- and they gun be half turn in response before they realise it 's baumann . baumann we have get to move ! they be come up from behind . Ebert look around , alert . ebert I do not see any -- baumann I tell you they be come . it 's a trap ! heydrich and Ebert cast a concerned glance over at they stricken comrade -- then Ebert make a hasty decision . ebert alright . let 's find cover forward . they jump to it and move forward through the tree , rifle point in readiness , heydrich limping along as best he can . but they have barely go ten yard before a machine gun open up from somewhere front right , bullet chopping into the tree trunk all around they -- force they back ebert ( cont have ) shit ! ! baumann and Ebert run for cover -- but heydrich trip ... as bullet kick into the snow around he , heydrich shout for help involuntarily ... engel slump in the kill - zone , engel be on automatic pilot . despite he appall injury he free hand struggle to open the flap on he holster , to get to he p.38 . he just manage it when two more bullet chop into he , smash into arm and abdomen . he slump back on he haunch with a gurgle moan -- but , miraculously , still stay upright . kreuzmann , schenke , krupp and franke huddle deeper behind cover as a sustained fusillade of shot rain down upon they suddenly . schenke Christ !! kreuzmann be make no attempt to return fire , simply stare impotently at engel , who have somehow summon the strength to shuffle around towards they , vainly try to inch he way to cover . franke , meanwhile -- he helmet bear the red cross of a field medic -- avert he eye so as not to look upon the man he cannot help . Lieutenant krupp be look around for option . krupp we be dead if we stay here !

Ebert wave he rifle wearily , a dirty white handkerchief tie to the barrel . he call again , cautious : ebert ( cont have ) we be come in . alright ? no reply from the bunker .

Inside be a Iron Cross , ist class . neumann look up at baumann . he open he mouth to ask something -- but realise he already know the answer . baumann ( cont have ) some people could not understand why I stop wear it . baumann close the box , push it deep down into the snow , and cover it over . 104 . baumann ( cont have ) but there will not be much glory for the wearer of that . nor any mother proud of they son for wear this uniform . if you have any sense you will save you courage for when this war 's over . -- that 's when you will really need it baumann struggle to he foot with finality , force he exhaust , aching body upright . baumann ( cont have ) it 's light enough , now . he trudge quietly forward towards a snow - cover ridge , then carefully and silently crawl up to look over the top . neumann quietly approach behind as baumann peer through he field glass . baumann' Pov - through binoculars the freeze dirt -road and the bunker be visible through the tree in the distance . at the rear of the bunker , several green-uniformed american soldier be milling around . the unmistakable , grey-uniformed figure of mirus be with they . a armed guard stand next to he as he try to converse with a american officer . he 's clearly nervous sick and confuse -- but , at least , alive . back to scene baumann pull back from the lip of the ridge and turn to neumann . baumann ( cont have ) have you get a handkerchief ? neumann shake he head . baumann pull out he own and give it to he . baumann ( cont have ) here ; wave it . do not try to hide . just walk straight down . you will be alright . neumann but be not you come ? after everything you say ... baumann shake he head . 105 . baumann I can not get out of it that easily . I have to stick it out to the end , now . but for you , it 's Christmas . you have be give another chance . -- now get go . baumann 's voice be suddenly harsh , and neumann reluctantly do as he 's tell . but after a few step he pause . neumann mirus tell I ... he tell I this be a place where the dead come back ( a pause ) but we do not really see anything , do we . it be nerve gas ; make we see thing ; hear thing ; drive schenke mad ? baumann do not answer , and after a moment neumann turn away again and head off through the tree , down towards the bunker . baumann watch neumann go -- then turn and trudge off in the opposite direction . CUT to : ext . forest clearing - dawn the depression in the ground be cover over completely , now . all that 's visible be a smooth , white concave sheet of virgin snow . CUT to : int . underground blackness . a muffle groaning , as if someone have suddenly wake . then a shuffle panic . a click -- and a cigarette lighter flicker into life ... illuminate the tiny pocket of dusty air into which schenke be crush under ton of rubble . only he head and one arm be free in the narrowest of cramped , confine space . burn , batter and tear but , incredibly , still tick -- for the moment . and , unfortunately for he , a vestige of sanity and comprehension seem to have return . it take he a second to fully recognise he predicament . buried alive ! 106 . and as if that 's not enough ... as the horrifying realisation slowly sink in ... : he begin to hear a scratching sound . as if something be beginning to claw its way through the rubble towards he . get closer . rat ? or something else ...? schenke struggle furiously , but can barely move a inch . panic set in . can not breathe ! the cigarette lighter beginning to sputter and die ... the scratch get louder and closer . until the tiny flame die and blackness close in . then schenke scream ! im jz jo
