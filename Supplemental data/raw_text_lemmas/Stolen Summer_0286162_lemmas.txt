Patrick look at Joe and tear form in he eye . rabbi it would mean a lot to we congregation and personally to my family if you would accept it . joe other man risk they life that day and every other day . rabbi we understand that . but , to be frank , it 's more personal than say give the fire department a sculpture in gratitude . you fire chief approve it . joe you speak to my boss ? rabbi yes . we want to make sure it be within the rule . the scholarship board can only grant one scholarship , and when Pete tell I of Patrick 's desire , I recommend Patrick . joe I imagine they want to give it to he in a big ceremony ? rabbi yes , I would imagine so . I think it would be a good public gesture . joe free publicity for the temple .

I work hard . my dad work hard . you will work hard . I will work hard . at school . to get a good job . joe bullshit ! we be not discuss this anymore tonight . I do not spend my day at the beach . I be tired ! Patrick begin to speak . Joe get in he face and put he finger in Patrick 's face . joe no more ! no more !

I will not allow you to take away the chance for Patrick to pursue he dream . the rabbi be be generous and you think it reflect poorly on you . joe that 's not ... margaret yes it be . you can not afford to put you child through college , so you have decide that college be bad . you know what , I agree college be a waste of time for most kid . but not Patrick . he waste he first few year of high school , but the last two year he have work he butt off and he generally love to learn . that 's what college be all about . joe how do you know what college be about ? margaret just because I do not go do not mean I do not think about it . but I fall in love , have baby , and have not regret one thing about the last nineteen year . until now ! you will not squash you child 's dream because they be not you dream . joe it 's not about dream , it 's about what 's right . if Patrick really want college , he could have get better grade and earn a scholarship . margaret he do not take school seriously . why ? Cause he think it be a waste of time because he would work for the city whether he get a 's or C 's . but one day he wake up and decide that not do he best be not the o'malley way . and he learn that from he father . and he 's get nothing but a 's that day forward . and he will do the same in college . from a scholarship that he accept from rabbi Jacobsen , or so help I God , Joe , the only thing colder than you food when you get home will be you bed .
