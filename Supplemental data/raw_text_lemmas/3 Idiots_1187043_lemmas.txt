I be not even bear then . so now you know that I be name after a typewrite institute and not the other way round ! most parent would name they enterprise after they child , but I have have the rare honour of be name after my father 's enterprise . I be proud of that fact . my father 's business flourish . he get marry and I be bear soon after . the plan be to get into engineering but I do not have enough mark in my higher secondary exam ( 12th standard ) to make the cut so I study commerce . I have also enrol in this foundation course for charter accountancy simultaneously , the class for which be hold in the evening . at the end of the foundation 03_introduction.indd 11 6/31/2010 1:47:17 am course , the exam for charter accountancy be to be hold . I despise this class from the very beginning . I have no interest in charter accountancy and this class be a huge imposition , both in term of time and the fact that I be waste this time on something I know be not for I . but I have the baggage of the engineering debacle on my head so abandon this very viable option would have appear self - indulgent , foolish , and luxurious at the time . I be afraid I rajkumar hirani with he father , suresh hirani . photo credit himmat Singh sekhwat , tehelka would hurt my parent and also somewhat scared to take this step that could harm my ' future 's . I carry on with the charade . subconsciously , I be aware that there be some set presumption about my future . I be expect to either become a charter accountant or take over my father 's business . both possibility mortify I . though at that point in time , I be not think about what would make I happy . like any normal person , I have responsibility and the usual concern that range from job to future to career . as 12 03_introduction.indd 12 6/31/2010 1:47:17 am the time for the foundation course 's exam draw close , I would often wake up in the middle of the night in cold sweat . finally , the exam be upon I . I realise that there be no escape the inevitable . it be imperative to tell my father that I find a root canal procedure more exciting than charter accountancy . even after twenty year , that evening be as clear in my head as if it have happen just yesterday . tt be a regular evening in nagpur but for I it be go to be the most significant and decisive evening of my life . my father be stand alone in the live room . I walk in and walk up to where he be stand , take lead - laden step . my throat be dry with uncertainty and fear . it be one thing to tell you father that you do not want to pursue what seem like a excellent career choice but it be another thing to not offer a alternative plan . the only thing I be clear about be that charter accountancy be not my cup of tea . my voice quiver with apprehension as I tell he that I do not want to take the exam because I do not enjoy charter accountancy at all . he look at I and then in the most nonchalant manner tell I to not do it and join he office start next morning . it be as short and simple as that . I be ecstatic . the weight of the world have lift from my shoulder . I feel free . this happen during the period lead up to the festival makar sankranti which be know for kite fly . I remember run up to we terrace right after ' the conversation 's and fly kite with this silly grin on my face . now , the kite fly seem almost like a symbol for the sense of freedom and relief that have sweep over I that day . my commerce class in college occupy only four hour of my time in the morning ( 7 be to 11.00 be ) , so the rest of my time be devote to help my father with he business ( 11.30 be to 6.30 pm ) which have graduate from type course to repair and sell new kind of calculator and other office equipment . I immerse myself in it with the gusto of a man who have just be extract from the gallow . I use to teach type , go out and give demo to prospective client , and repair spoiled unit . I be even send to Delhi to do a course in repair electronic calculator . this be the period where I have my first brush with theatre . I meet narendra thakur and a few other student who use to perform and produce play regularly at we college . I join they . ( before this , my only experience on stage be in the 9th standard . I be cast in the role of ' noorjahan 's in a play . ) I become a regular with the theatre gang . abandon the foundation course open up my evening to 13 03_introductionindd 13 , 6/31/2010 1:47:22 am be occupy , and occupy they be with write , read , and brainstorm about play . this stir something within I . I have always believe that there be two approach to learn : one be to study something academically and the other be to get interested in something and then start to gather material on it and learn about it . the latter be always a more gratify experience . I would hunt for Hindi play in quaint bookshop . I would devour anything on theatre . we would participate in competition , youth festival , and travel to any place that even hint at a opportunity for exposure in the field . youth festival be a platform where team from all the college in nagpur come and perform . at one such festival , I meet another theatre group which be perform for the nagpur Medical College . there be a few people in that group , especially debashish Naha , who be passionate about theatre and take this enterprise very seriously . there be a instant connection with debashish and soon we friendship lead to my theatre group merge with he to form a new theatre group call awaaz . debashish and I would spend hour work on play . he would get I play write in bangla find he voice ... perform on stage ( middle ) for awaaz , in nagpur . 14 03_introductionindd 14 6/31/2010 1:47:22 am and we would sit down and translate they in Hindi . we start put up play under we banner . personality such as marathi theatre - director kishore kulkarni , who have receive acclaim on stage be invite to direct play for we group . we learn under many such people who have a command over they craft and a natural flair for the medium . since everyone be busy till 6 pm everyday , we use to meet after that . this meeting be hold either at the bengali Association Hall or at the sindhi gurudwara nearby which have a hall , or at the local school hall . wherever we find some empty space , we park ourselves . the rehearsals use to go on till midnight . we pursue this with such passion that theatre soon become a obsession . we manage to put up a record three to four play a year . this play be not restrict to perform at college . we start put up tickete show . apart from the creative aspect , the entire production of the play be handle by we . we organised everything from book the hall , put up the set , prop , costume , account , and even tickete . watch play be not the prefer pastime in nagpur , so we use to sell the ticket to friend and relative . account be maintain diligently . in fact , I still have some of the account from that day . we use to barely cover we production cost and that be all we want . we be not do this for profit . we just want to be able to put up play and hope to cover cost and use the money to put up the next one . on that rare occasion , if anything be earn over and above the production cost , it ensure a grand meal for we entire group . it be not difficult to speak to my father the second time . intuitive and observant , he be not blind to my grow passion for theatre . the suggestion to tread this path in earnest come from my father . he tell I to enrol in a program to get formal education ( my father be a great believer in learn ) in the field of write , direct , and storytelling . the natural choice be to apply to the Film and Television Institute of India ( fti ) . my first attempt ( 1983 ) to get into ftii in the direction course be unsuccessful . I have very little knowledge of the exam and the enrolment procedure . I have travel to Mumbai to take the exam . there I learn that the entrance exam for ftii be exactly like bank exam , and anyone study for it would clear it without blink . I also realise that seat for the direction course be few and almost everyone apply for this course . I come back to nagpur and enrol myself in the faculty of Law as that seem like a reasonable option if thing do not work out . alongside , I start prepare for the ftii exam . the next year ( 1984 ) , I apply again to ftii but 15 03_introduction.indd 15 5/31/2010 1:47:30 am learn the grammar of cinema ... at fil . this time for the editing and not the direction course . I get admission . the day I receive the telegram , inform I about my admission to ftii , be the happiest day of my life . I be delirious with joy . I think I have arrive and my life be make . this think stem from naivetÃ© . sitting in nagpur , I have only hear of the ten to fifteen name of really successful people who have graduate from ftii so I assume that get admission mean I be set up for life . I look at my admission in the Institute as one look at get into law school or engineering . once you get in and work hard , the moment you graduate , you become a director . all this illusion be shattered two day into my time at ftii . my enthusiasm be replace by a inferiority complex . I be from a small town in the midst of student waxing eloquent about theory , film , and idea that be Greek and Latin to I . it take I time but I find my foot again and get my voice back . it teach I a very important lesson : you can not lose yourself just by perceive yourself to know less . if stereotype have to be break , then first they have to be break within you . 16 03_introduction.indd 16 5/31/2010 1:47:30 am thus , begin the journey of disillusionment and enlightenment , unlearn and learn , passion , failure , and fulfillment . after three year at ftii , I move to Mumbai ( 1987 ) and stay with my friend and batchmate sriram raghavan ( filmmaker ) . my first job be as a editor on a advertisement direct by bharat rangachari . after this , I be recommend by late editor renu saluja and I edit a documentary . I be pay rs 1500 for my first job and rs 500 for the second one . but thing be slow to come by . after sometime , the situation become precarious . video have just explode on the scene so we be hard press for assignment as we do not know how to edit on video . I could not even turn to my father for help because he be go through a financial slump . his business of typewriter have take a beat because of the arrival of computer . so both my father and I be face what you can term a ' technological gap 's . the first year in Mumbai ( 1987 ) , after pass out from the Institute , be a difficult one . I come very close to give up during that year . there be many dark night of the soul . I think about go back to nagpur . maybe do something related to cinema there . it be a matter of survival , and the strangest option come to my mind . I entertained the idea of shoot marriage video creatively and put a completely unique spin to they . maybe do multiple camera set-up and scale thing up considerably . export , which be a much talk about thing back then , be the other option that come to mind . I go to Fort in Mumbai ( there be many street vendor of second - hand book in Fort ) and pick up a book on export . I be desperately grop in the dark try to hold on to something . fortunately , ftii revive its one-month video course that be promise to we . we rush back to the Institute for the course . after one month , we return to Mumbai with the knowledge of what would be we survival kit in the city : video editing . I join a editing studio call ekta Studio ( 1988 ) as a in - house editor on a monthly salary of rs 1000 . my six - month stint here give I enough contact and clout in the market to get regular work . I tell myself , rather theatrically , that it matter not if I do not make a lot of money : this life I have devote to cinema . I convinced myself with something as dramatic as that . once you accept this , then the dark night disappear and all night convert to be night of battle : the battle to become better , to excel , to strive towards quality . during this phase of find my foot in the business , sanjay leela bhansali , my peer from ftii , who be assist Vinod , call I to edit the promo of 1942 : a Love Story ( 1992 ) . but thing do not go beyond that just yet . meanwhile , from editing I 17 03_introduction.indd 17 5/31/2010 1:47:34 am have move up to direct advertising film and open my own production house call canvas film ( 1991 ) . in 1998 , I be call in to edit the promo of kareeb as well because Vinod have like my work on 1942 : a Love Story . this be again a one - off stint . I continue do work in advertising . canvas film flourish and I become financially secure . I have settle into a comfortable pattern till the morning I receive a call from Vinod ( 2000 ) . he want I to edit Mission Kashmir . not just the promo but the entire film . initially , I be reluctant as I do not want to leave a lucrative set-up . but once I learn of renu 's condition ( renu , Vinod 's first wife and film editor , be suffer from cancer and she condition be go from bad to worse with each pass day ) , I could not say no . it be during the make of Mission Kashmir that my latent desire to direct a feature film resurface . watch cinema be make with such passion and commitment by Vinod and he team rekindle the spirit in I that I have in my theatre day . * # , 2 & 7 cv a mile to go before I sleep ... 18 03_introductionindd 18 5/31/2010 1:47:34 am I know I be ready to make a film . and I begin work on write my first film . how munna bhai come about be another long story but that I will keep for the book on munna bhai m.b.b.s . so why do I just spill my gut and share my life with you ? simply because so much of 3 / diot be personal . 1 be a small town man from nagpur with no connection or background in film . I start work towards something that make I happy and that be all there be to it . I work with passion and honesty , and even if success have not come my way , I would still have be really happy as I get to chase my dream . it have be a long and wonderful ride , but the key here be , it have be a ride of my choice . the desire to make 3 idiot stem from this think . I be not try to say that engineering or charter accountancy or any other profession for that matter be any less than wildlife photography or filmmake , and so on . my belief be simple . choose you own path . choose without fear . it be not a foolproof formula for happiness or success but it be definitely one that be most likely to work . â€” rajkumar hirani 19 03_introduction.indd 19 5/31/2010 1:47:35 am 03_introduction.indd 20 5/31/2010 1:47:96 am the original screenplay ext . airport â€” day a plane taxie on the runway . int . airplane â€” day a AIR hostess close the overhead bin . farhan ( 30 ) , a passenger , be read a book when he phone ring . he scramble for it , embarrassed he have not turn it off . other passenger look at he disapprovingly . he sheepishly take the call . wer a beat . wer ( incredulous ) a ?

'' the mviethod in the iviadness rajkumar hirani , abhijat joshi , & vidhu Vinod chopra recollect in the course of put this book together , the many conversation I have with rajkumar hirani reveal that in a life span over four decade fill with many challenging and debilite experience , the one that be clearly etched in he memory as the most oppressive of they all be the month precede he 12th standard exam . '' every night I would get a recur dream that I be take a exam and I do not know the answer to even a single question . I would wake up in cold sweat , '' he say . raju attribute this to the fear psychosis create around exam and grade in India . the first few daunt month at ftii , a year without work and money in Mumbai , myriad struggle to set up a career , the herculean task of make movie be lesser strain compare to the pressure of Higher secondary exam in he life . it be no surprise then that when he start hunt for a subject he feel deeply about as the DNA for he first feature film , he decide on the story of three friend in a medical college . the aim be to weave a tale that enthralled with anecdote from life in a hostel and make a comment both on the education system and the medical practice in India . for raju , life in a hostel signify freedom . the time he spend do theatre with he group awaaz with the student from nagpur Medical College , hostel life at fti , and the horror of education engineered towards grade be experience that have leave a indelible impression on he . therefore , the first draft of munna bhai m.b.b.s. have , instead of the lovable bhai and he sidekick circuit , three friend live in a medical college . the script and the idea keep change and evolve . at the end , the three friend have to wait and give way to the duo that become the indian equivalent of batman and Robin : the incorrigible and immensely endear munna and circuit . but the initial idea that he start with lay latent in raju 's subconscious for the next six year . such must have be he desire to make this film one day and so great the need for the world to have this idea translate on screen that the universe conspire to make it happen . vidya balan and the Mumbai deluge of 2005 play significant role in pull this blueprint out from the deep recess of raju 's mind . it be May 2005 and vidya have just finish shoot for the first schedule of lage raho munna bhai . she and raju have strike up a instant rapport often recommend interesting film and book to each other . vidya happen to read five Point someone during this period . she know chetan so she be aware that he be keen to get the book across to raju as possible material for a film . vidya immediately leat she copy of the book to raju say that this be a idea she feel have leg . but be in the middle of make a film , raju do not have time to breathe let alone read . the book gather dust on he bookshelf for sometime . and then in July , Mumbai face the worst rain- induce flood ever . life for everyone in Mumbai come to a standstill . raju 's lane be completely flood and he have no choice but to stay home for a couple of day . that be when he pick up five Point someone and read it . the story of three friend and they experience in a engineering college take he by surprise and bring to the fore he first draft of munna bhai m.b.b.s. he discuss it with Vinod and abhijat . the rights to adapt the book into a film be buy and the rest as they say be history . the one -liner ( a scene - wise synopsis of the screenplay and its trajectory ) of 3 idiot be ready in a record nine day and the first draft of the screenplay with dialogue be ready in 18 day from the day abhijat joshi , vidhu Vinod chopra , and rajkumar hirani start work on it ( 2006 ) . after that , it take the three writer , two - and - a-half year to arrive at a shoot script . the evolution of the screenplay involved ponderous work on innumerable draft , multiple scenario ( some retain and many abandon ) , copious amount of green tea , long walk , and several trip around the globe . the journey be through a labyrinth of possibility . [ in some draft pia be farhan 's ex-girlfriend ; chatur and not suhas be to marry pia ; farhan be a unhappy corporate honcho in New York ; instead of wildlife photography , linguistics be farhan 's passion ; Joy and phunsukh wangdu be add and delete frequently .] the key to the screenplay be to find the best way forward that enable the narrative to be consistently compelling , real , and entertaining . this interview with the writer be record between January and April 2010 , at various location , in Mumbai . 322 there be a method to the three of you work together . how do it work ? VC : we have be work together for many year and have immense mutual respect and affection for each other . abhijat and I go back to the kareeb day and with raju my write association start with munna bhai m.b.b.s. 1 do not sit with they and write continuously . my biggest contribution and challenge be to channelise they passion and energy in a direction . I be they rubbish radar . they do the write and come to I constantly with material at regular interval . I either change some thing or add new thing to it or reject it . my work here be of a good reviewer . rh : abhijat and I write constantly while work on the screenplay and once we have a ready draft , we start the session with Vinod . he be brilliant at catch the problem , the chink in the script , the flaw . it be fantastic to get this kind of perspective on one 's work as one be go along . it keep we on the right track . aj : the interesting thing about the three of we work together be the diversity in we method of work which eventually enhance the material we work on . Vinod 's method of write and raju 's and my method be completely different but we goal be the same : a great story . raju and I operate by work on individual scene and later bind they together which bring the desire unpredictability to we work whereas Vinod like he character arc and plot define . therefore , when we take the scene to Vinod , he lend the necessary prespective to they . the principle which have be the guide metaphor throughout aristotle 's writings have be that the action of a narrative or drama must be present as '' a complete whole , with its several incident so closely connect that the transposal [ shifting a incident / scene from one point in the narrative to another ] or withdrawal of any one of they will disjoin and dislocate the whole . '' this be the principle that Vinod follow . his focus be the whole . every scene in the film must carry the story forward . it must have a purpose that serve this movement . you cannot narrate a scene to Vinod and tell he that the purpose of the scene be to make people laugh or cry . he will immediately throw it out . scene might be luminous on they own but they be useless if they do not light up the whole narrative be Vinod 's belief . raju and I often get carry away by the individual scene . in the second half of 3 diot , Vinod take out a few dramatic scene which in hindsight I feel would have weaken we film . he believe that we cannot overload the audience because after a while , they stop caring . there be fatigue that set in . you need to have that balance where you do not give in to the 323 temptation of overdo thing . to give you a example , the speech scene be keep not because it be funny but because it have a purpose beyond make the audience laugh . the speech demonstrate the pitfall of rote learn and bring the conflict philosophy in the film , of chase excellence and blindly chase success , out in the open . this be the way in which we work together . different perspective enable we to retain quality without lose focus . the germ of the idea come from chetan bhagat 's book five Point someone . what be it that draw you to the book ? rh : I love the description of hostel life in the book . it instantly hold my attention . I have live in a the hostel , like the boy in the book , so it be very appeal to I . Education and the pressure one face with regard to education that would result in a ' better life 's , the one define by society and not necessarily by the individual , have always be of great interest to I . this give I a wonderful opportunity to combine this thought with a few anecdote from the book . it take over two - and - a- half year for the screenplay to come together . what be the challenge that you face while write it ? rh : five Point someone , though immensely enjoyable , be very anecdotal in its treatment . I know the moment I read the book that we would have to spend considerable time adapt it into a screenplay . there be nothing in the book that bind it together . for a film , a bind thread be critical . the audience have to be take on a journey through the character and plot . it have to move towards something to hold the attention of the viewer . for example , in lagaan , one of the thing that keep you hook till the end be the cricket match . the whole film be move towards that . I could not find this thread within the book and from there stem the desire to create a external story . the idea for the external story come to I in kenya . the kenyan Film board have invite a select group of indian film director and cinematographers to explore kenya as a shoot destination for indian film . therefore , nikhil advani , shaad Ali , and I , include a few other director and cinematographers , travel to kenya . initially , as usual , I be very reluctant to go . what happen with I be that whenever I be invite to some place and if I be work , I start think that it be a waste of time , and , therefore , why should I go . this be the reason I decline most of the time and then I regret it . twice over I pass 324 up the opportunity to go to Australia think that I be work on my script and it would be a waste of time . in both case , I could have easily go and come back and my life would not have change . so when this invitation come , sometime in March 2007 , I decide I must go . I go but out of habit carry my laptop with I hope I would find time to get some work do there . on reach kenya , I discover that they have a pack itinerary plan for we for each day of we stay . obviously , they want to show we the maximum number of location . the day use to start at 6 be and end at 9 pm . after two day of intense sightseeing , I get anxious about my script . I start get very edgy . on the third day , I refuse to go . nikhil and everyone else start laugh at I . I realise that if I tell they the truth , then I would not be able to escape so I lie and tell they that I be not well . they leave without I . I take out my laptop and start work on my script . funnily , one lady who be with the film board , land up in my room with a doctor . I sheepishly tell they that now I be better . hopefully , when she read this she shall realise how pivotal this day of work in kenya be to 3 idiot . that entire day , the one day I manage to work on my script , away from all phone call and distraction , I sit in my hotel room think about the story that I need to introduce to bind the film . that be when this think about the bet between the rival strike I . one friend go away and then the other two search for he . for the audience , the bind factor would then be â€” do they find this friend or not ? if they do find he , then what be the story of the friend ? why do he leave ? where do he go ? do he win the bet or do he lose ? at every stage , this question would be at the back of they mind . this desire and curiosity in the audience to get to the end of the film be the backbone of a screenplay . if I be to remove this entire story from the screenplay , then the film become just a story set in a college and you be not really look forward to anything . I remember I call abhijat from there and tell he this idea and he love it . the icing on the cake be abhijat come up with the imposter idea . aj : the imposter idea in the film come from a real - life story . I know a man ( I can not name he as he be someone from the industry ) who actually do what the real ranchoddas do in the film . a man apply to ftii and get through . he also apply to a engineering college and get select . he get select in many place . he be a brilliant guy . of all the entrance exam he clear , he decide to enrol in the engineering college . this brilliant guy be we imposter 's friend . the imposter want to study cinema so he take he friend 's permission and impersonate he . he study at ftii for three year pose as the brilliant guy who choose engineering . 325 the imposter pass out of the Institute , join the film industry , change back to he real identity and make film . this real - life story , which not too many people know about , inspire the whole rancho-imposter track . rh : we combine the search and the imposter track and get the story of the film . the bind thread which be miss to keep the narrative move be now in place . this be probably one of the most critical of the challenge we face in write 3 idiot . ' what accord to you be the core of 3 idiot ? aj : the first scene that we write for 3 idiot be the conversation between boman and aamir at Joy 's funeral . this scene be in a different form and shape the first time we write it . on the night of the suicide , rancho go up to the tower in the campus , ring the bell , gather the student and deliver a speech . but in this form , the scene become too dramatic , grim , and preachy . we work for day to make it more real and yet retain the drama and impact . the scene you see in the film feel more natural so we change the speech to a conversation at the funeral . we purposely choose to make the boy who commit suicide a Christian so that the funeral be set in a cemetery . the grey of the cemetery and the rain give the scene the grim and colourless tone that we need . this scene , accord to I , be the core of 3 idiot . why should people be kill themselves ? there be something wrong with the system . why be everyone run after grade and not knowledge ? that be what the film address and attack . VC : I agree with abhijat . 3 / diot question the system and its pitfall . the pressure to chase grade lead student to give in to pursuit that might not be the one of they choice and compel they to take the set and decide path to set and decide goal . this only lead to suicide or mediocrity . Chasing excellence be not encourage . excellence over success be a philosophy I have always follow which have lead I to take some very irrational decision that have make no business sense . but because the pursuit be for quality , in the long run , success come in leap and bound . it be a very personal film . not only do it embody a philosophy that be close to you heart but it heavily borrow from you life as well . which portion in the film have be pick from you life ? rh : there be a lot in the film from the scene to the quirk add to embellish character to dialogue that we have take from we life . I use to know a guy 326 call prasan jain in ftii who once have a bath at the entrance gate of the campus to make the faculty aware that there be a acute water shortage in the hostel . so rancho bathing in the garden come from there . '' jahanpanah tussi great ho '' be also borrow from the Film Institute . we be rag for a entire month after we join . all throughout that month , if we spot a senior , we have to pull down we pants , bend over , pat we butt , and say , '' jahanpanah tussi great ho . tohfa kubool karo . '' this practice be call farshi . in my day at the nagpur Medical College with my theatre buddy , I get to know about this guy who use to slip magazine under the door of other student to distract they during exam . the competition there be so fierce that people resort to some really desperate thing . the conversation between farhan and he father be again inspire by the conversation I have with my father which I have mention in detail in the introduction to this book . aj : I have already tell you about the impostor story . apart from the search for the third friend and the imposter track , the third primary element in the story be the bet between chatur and rancho . this bet signifies the clash of rival ideology . we get the idea for this from a anecdote from Vinod 's initial year in the industry . after the trial of one of the film make by a big bollywood producer , Vinod hitched a ride with he in he posh car to be drop to the nearest bus stop . the producer ask Vinod what he think about the film . Vinod launch into shredd the screenplay bit by bit and let the man know without mincing word that the film be utter rubbish . the gentleman turn around and say , '' jadd vaddi gaadi lenga to tadd dekhanga tu kaisi picture banay a '' ( when you get use to riding in a big car , then we will see the kind of film you make ) . the producer 's point be simple : when you get use to the luxury , it be what work at the box office that take precedence over the quality of cinema . Vinod get out of the car and swore that this be something he would never adhere to . he be clear from the beginning that the ball game be cinema and not money . if you get the former right , then the latter would follow . this clash of philosophy , of think , money versus good cinema be the trigger for the bet between rancho and chatur . the rancho '' definition of book and the machine '' scene be my gift to raju 's son veer . raju be help veer with he homework . one of the question in the assignment be : why do we celebrate good Friday ? veer 's answer to that be '' to commemorate the resurrection of Christ . '' raju want to know if veer know the meaning of this answer . to he surprise , veer do not . raju launch into explain it to he and then ask veer to write the answer the way he have understand it . but veer be adamant that it have to be write only in the manner that he have write it or he teacher would 327 not be happy . easy or uncomplicate language and , most importantly , veer away from the expect and accept form of the answer be not a option . raju be very baffle and concerned about this . he tell I this story over the phone and it become the genesis of the rancho- Professor ' definition - of - machine 's face -off . the scene where rancho , farhan , and raju go to farhan 's house after the director send the warning letter to both raju and farhan 's parent be also inspire from two different incident that happen in my life and raju 's . once , I have meet a lady who be furious with she daughter . the daughter be a bright girl but the lady be yell at she because she have score 91 per cent instead of 94 per cent . the 3 per cent drop be unacceptable . the insanity of this mad race for mark leave I amused and disturb at the same time . when we be write this scene , I really want to incorporate this . while at ftii , raju with he Institute friend use to travel to Mumbai often over the weekend . on one such weekend , a friend of he invite they to he house for dinner . they all land up at he place eager to devour the free food so look forward to in that money - strapped college day . the friend who invite they and he mother have have a big fight . they sit in silence wait for the announcement that the food be ready . after two hour , the mother get up and tell the boy , '' beta agli baar aaoge to khaana zaroor kha kar jaana . '' raju still remember this because it be close to midnight when they be ask to leave and they be famish with barely over twenty rupee between all of they . the watch track between pia and rancho again come from a anecdote that Vinod have tell I about ... VC : see I tell you I can not remember half the thing . abhijat have be gift with a photographic memory . a relative of mine be work in the Gulf and be very well off . I be not do that well then . during one of he visit , he be flaunt he watch which cost a couple of lakh . I hear he out and then exclaim that there must be something wrong with he watch . he be take aback and frantically examine he expensive watch . there be nothing wrong with it accord to he so he ask I to explain myself . ' aapki ghadi itni mehngi hai aur meri sirf do sau rupyaye ki lekin phir bhi time same dikhateen hein '' ( you watch be very expensive and mine cost only rs 200 but both of they tell the same time ) , be my reply which leave he speechless . rancho propel the story forward . he illustrate the philosophy of the film . a lot of people feel that he character do not have a arc in the film . rancho 328 enter the story , preach , and then leave . he be too perfect . how do rancho as a character evolve and do you have any fear and apprehension that he might appear to be more fiction than real as he begin to take shape ? rh : the backbone of rancho 's character which also separate he from everybody else be he lack of fear . he be a brilliant , free-spirite , and honest boy who be chase what he be interested in most . probably a person without fear have become unfathomable today so rancho might seem unreal to some but to I he be very real . my first thought on rancho be that he be a boy from a village who have have no experience with formal education so he do not know the fear of teacher . he speak to they as he speak to everyone . I could have dwell on he childhood and background a little more in the film to bring this to the fore but I eventually feel that it be not necessary . rancho life by he philosophy and he belief . he make choice which be absurd conventionally but he be not here to conform and he do not feel the need to . VC : why do he appear superhuman ? it be very easy for raju , abhijat , and I to flesh out rancho as we understand he completely . in fact , I see a lot of myself in rancho . there be just too many similarity . I be always a topper in my school . I remember be throw out of class because I dare to ask my teacher who hamlet be . in college , I find BA very boring so I use to attend ma class and I even study the book prescribe for ma economics . in my BA exam , I score only 55 per cent . I be a consistent topper with score usually range between eighty and ninety . I be sure that there be a mistake in the way I have be mark . I ask for a recheck and realise that the objection to some of the answer stem from the fact that I do not follow the pattern of write the expect answer . I be quote writer and theory , with all due respect , which be out of the purview of my teacher . therefore , when I take my final BA exam , I write all my reference with the page number and the title of the book and the author . this be how I top my BA exam . what surprised and baffle I though be the resistance of the educator to reward inventiveness . this reluctance and rigidity be steepe in we education system . you would be surprised to know that ftii have fail I . I be throw out without a diploma . then my student film , murder at monkey Hill , win the National Award and be also nominate for a oscar . the moment I win the National Award , ftii appoint I as a member of they govern council . in this capacity , I speak out against the staff as I be aware of everything that go on there . the staff protest against I and say that I could not be on the govern council because I have fail . the 329 ftii management have to pass I then and I get my diploma . they have fail I because they want I to take a lot of exam , some of which I think be completely ridiculous . for example , they want we to submit a feature film script which I never do . the reason for that be simple . I feel we be not yet train to do this . I protest against this unfair practice . it give I no pleasure to say this but I do not have any teacher to look up to , and at that stage of you life , a guide force can be such a boon . this experience and the lack of guidance become my reason to back talent . I be passionate about do this because I never have that privilege . I learn the English language at the age of 16 ( as late as that ) and what be I do now ? I be make a film in Hollywood . even now , I have a problem understanding my actor and I ask they to talk slowly because it be tough for I to understand they accent . I can draw many parallel but the point I be make be that rancho be not a unbelievable , fictional , larger - than - life character . he be probably someone who be a little tough to understand in this world because he do not conform . we be so happy sit back and accept whatever be dole out that anyone who question , be consider a aberration . aj : while write , we do not look at rancho as a character in the film but as the hero of the film and he have be write like that , though he be neither superhuman nor a comic book hero . he have the attribute of a hero and it would be dangerous to pretend otherwise . he be a uninhibit free spirit with insatiable curiosity and genuine query . he do not operate with arrogance or cockiness and aamir have also play he with that inherent earnestness . but it would be incorrect to say that he do not have a arc in the film or a journey . his journey in the film start from Joy 's suicide . he would not have take on the system have he not see that a perfectly wonderful boy be drive to suicide because of the mechanical , unthink , ruthless system education have be reduce to . this stir something inside he that he cannot ignore . a clear inspiration and influence here be the film deewar ( 1975 ) . amitabh bachchan be a daily wage worker at the dockyard . all worker there have to pay extortion money to Peter , the local goon . one man refuse to pay this and he be kill by the goons . the death of this innocent person change amitabh . he decide to fight back . '' raheem chacha ab woh hoga jo 25 saal mein nahin hua . agle hafie se ek aur coolie inn darindon ko hafia nahin dene wala hai '' ( something that have not happen in 25 year will happen now . next week one more worker will not pay the extortion money to the goons ) , go the famous dialogue . without this death which change he , amitabh would have remain just a worker content 330 to earn he daily wage . this incident , its futility and cruelty , change he . while write rancho , raju and I have discuss this scene from deewar . therefore , Joy 's suicide be a turn point in rancho 's life . this be he journey . and in the course of he own journey , he change life include he own . like rancho , virus 's character must have be a challenge . how do you achieve balance there ? rh : during munna bhai m.b.b.s. , we be shoot a scene where boman be to deliver a speech to the student . he improvise and add in the speech that a doctor should be dispassionate towards he patient . he must maintain a emotional distance to give he perspective . the exact line be : '' agar mein apni family par operate karoonga to mere haath kampenge . '' while scripting this , my debate with boman be that this argument be so logical and valid that it completely justify Dr. asthana 's character . it make my hero look weak . boman look at I and say that this be my problem and not he . as a antagonist , he must have a point of view and if that point of view weaken the protagonist , then the director have to make the protagonist stronger . this have stay with I since then . I have consciously apply this while construct the character in my film . this help in create character that be real and not one dimensional . therefore , virus despite he quirk have a ring of reality . his intention be not to go out there and harm student . he believe that life be a race and if you do not run fast enough , you would be leave behind . this be he point of view and he be unwaver in he belief . the film start with farhan abandon a flight that have already take off . but it be a long process before you arrive at this open for the film . in the earlier draft I read , several approach be try include the one where you be even contemplate bring in amitabh bachchan as the narrator . how do you reach this open scene and why be this scene the most appropriate accord to you ? rh : the start point be always tough . the idea be to set up a extraordinarily large activity which farhan have to abandon at the very mention of rancho . this be do to establish the importance of rancho in farhan 's life . aj : though we go along with the airplane scene to open the film , I do have a alternate scene that happen to be my favourite . give a chance , I would still do that instead of this . in my favour beginning , farhan be a linguist and be in the middle of a conversation between two head of State at the UN . he be the interpreter . he 331 leave this session to meet rancho and this two man be leave in the lurch . there be a lot of comedy that emerge from linguistics but we do not have enough time to develop it so we go along with the airplane scene . the airplane scene be also more dramatic . but this thing be a matter of exploration . one explore multiple possibility and then choose the one that best work for the film . Joy 's suicide be a critical point of debate . there be draft that have it and several that do not . its inclusion be probably most fiercely debate in the entire screenplay . it be feel that this be too dark a incident for this film or that it might dilute the revelation of virus 's son 's death be a suicide . what be the think behind the suicide scene and the reason for place it within 20 minute of get into the film ? VC : there be a lot of back and forth that happen over this . I have serious doubt about whether we should include this or not . but what convinced I be that this give motivation to rancho 's character . raju take it a step further by add a montage and a voice - over at the editing stage . there be a small montage with farhan 's voice - over talk about rancho and he quirky personality and from there the voice - over say , '' ek aur tha bilkul rancho jaisa . '' and we cut to Joy . this voice - over that raju introduce at the editing table , integrate the Joy track into the script . otherwise , it would have be too much of a jump . it also illustrate that a brilliant guy like rancho can go one way or the other . he can either become phunsukh wangdu or become so deject by see mediocrity flourish around he that he give up on life . rh : Joy 's suicide be throw out and bring back innumerable time . abhijat and I be very keen to keep it as we feel that the conflict in the film would start from there , otherwise it would just be a fun film without anything substantial in it . Vinod and aamir feel that it should not be there . they think that it be too dark and grim . it be a jarring inclusion in the film . but abhijat and I be convinced that this have to be there . this go on for a long time . in fact , we only get it back into the script a month before the shoot start ( September 2008 ) . but the debate over it continue and then finally the montage and the voice - over during the edit , settle the matter . earlier , the rancho montage be not there in the film . we have not even plan to keep it . nevertheless , I shot it . simply , so that if I ever feel like revive it , then it could be do . the feedback after the first screen of the film we organised for a sample audience reveal that rancho be a mad genius be not come across . I add the montage then and , link 332 it with Joy 's introduction by that voice -over , make Joy both integral to the plot and also leat he credibility . aj : Joy 's suicide be the spine of the film . the second -half revelation be climatic device . but Joy 's suicide be what make rancho realise that pressure to perform be the killer and it have to be fight . it be this belief that take rancho 's character and the story forward . otherwise , why be he do the thing that he be do ? the first half of the film would become insubstantial if we take out the suicide . the challenge be to put this thing that worry we about the system right on top so that we know what rancho be fight , and the film be save from sink under the weight of this intense scene . the interval point be a bit of a shock . the tone of the scene and the treatment be unlike the rest of the film . there be other interval point discuss as well before arrive at this one . how do this come about ? rh : I want the fact that rancho be a imposter to be reveal earlier in the film . I feel if we stretch revealing this till the interval , then it would seem that this very rich kid have come into a college and be have fun . I feel that the audience need to be tell as quickly in the film as possible that he be a imposter because it would get the audience to feel for he . so in the earlier draft , we come out of the flashback one more time in the first half to reveal that rancho be not actually rancho but a imposter . then we go back into the flashback and there be a different interval point ( farhan and raju discover that pia be get marry be one of the option consider ) . but after a lot of think and work on the script , I feel that the interval would be a great point to reveal that rancho be not rancho but a imposter . sometimes , I still feel that it might have be better to reveal this earlier even though what we eventually put in the film be a great interval point . in the end , this be choice that one make . so once it be settle that this be go to be the interval point , we narrate it to Vinod . he suggest that we add the element of the college photograph have a different face on rancho . this appeal to I as it enhance the scene . VC : unlike the West , indian cinema do not follow the three - act structure which be a two - act deal . it be a very unusual way of watch movie . no one else across the world watch film like this â€” you see one part of the film , break for samosas and chai , then you watch the rest of the film . this make the interval point extremely critical . therefore , one must invest a lot of think in where the break would happen . in this film , my think process be focuss on the level of interest of 333 the audience when they would go and buy they popcorn . basically , they eagerness to come back to find out what happen next in the film be vital . when I make the suggestion , I do not think that raju would retain it . it lend a thriller - like quality to the twist . I feel that the audience would enjoy the suspense . the first time I tell raju , he say he like it but I do not believe anything raju say in the evening . it be a age - old joke between we that I be the ' in - the moment guy 's and he be the ' next morning guy 's . he like to mull over and think over all the option . he make up he mind only after that . so I always go with what raju feel about thing the next morning and not on the evening that they be suggest . I be happy that he retain it . the film initially end with this people find rancho teach in Ladakh in a school , lead a simple happy life do what he love do . phunsukh ' wangdu be not in the film at all . how do the idea of phunsukh wangdu fall into place ? rh : yes , that be true . phunsukh wangdu be not in the film earlier . the film end with farhan , raju , and pia reach Ladakh and discover that rancho teach in this fascinating little school and that be he success . whatever he want to do , he do it . but we feel that maybe the audience would not understand this . they would probably say that ' yaar khush to hain , lekin paise to kam kamaata hai to '' ( he might be happy but he earn very little money ) . we feel that to make the audience understand , we have to show he to be successful in the conventional way . this be the reason we add the phunsukh wangdu , covete - scientist angle and backtrack to plant he in the film . this be where chatur 's quest emerge . he be show to be look for someone in the entire film and at the end the man he be search for be rancho . the idea be to show a man live a simple life out of choice . rancho have the option of signing a deal with anyone and rake in million but he have choose to do differently . we feel this would help the audience understand thing better . another reason be that we keep feel that the climax be not great . it seem that we climax be the delivery and then we be just wrapping up the film in Ladakh . it feel weak . we , however , be do a lot of thing in Ladakh . first , we be show a unusual school . as farhan , raju , and pia enter the school , they see ( a entire scene be there intially ) that a race be go on , kid be run and one kid fall down . instead of carry on , all the kid run back to pick he up and then proceed to finish the rest of the race . this guy look at each 334 other and say that this can only be rancho 's school . chatur 's electrocution scene initially have millimeter in it . so all this material be there but this piece be not come together to result in a spectacular end to the film . when we find phunsukh wangdu , thing start fall into place . but to clean this up and to get it all together at the end take we a lot of time . finally , it evolve to become a big twist at the end . we solve the phunsukh wangdu riddle in we head in goa . abhijat be on a write visit to Mumbai . I receive a call to attend the Film Festival in goa ( iffi , end 2007 ) . we decide to travel to goa for two day on this pretext . any reason to get away from Mumbai and write . we stay at the same hotel as the one where we have shot the lage raho song with the old people . abhijat get very excited about it . he have this fascination for revisit place that have a context . except for the chief minister 's party the night we have arrive , we do not attend the festival at all . we take a long walk on the beach the day we arrive and phunsukh wangdu fall into place . it be quite magical and we be very happy with the climax after that . phunsukh wangdu , the real identity of rancho , be reveal at the end . the point of revelation that rancho be actually phunsukh wangdu be something you battle with for over a year . what make you decide the final route ? rh : this be a tough one to decide . we be unsure of this right up till the day before we shot the scene . abhijat and I feel that it should be reveal the moment the friend reunite , before chatur 's arrival . by do this , we would have reveal this to the audience that rancho be phunsukh wangdu , the man chatur be chase and chatur 's dialogue and demeanour with rancho after this revelation would become even more hilarious to the audience as they would know that he would be in for a real shock when he find out that rancho be phunsukh . but both aamir and madhavan be of the view that the revelation should happen at the end so that the film end on a high note . they feel that revealing it earlier would weaken this dramatic twist . this be when the tussle start . abhijat and I resist for a long time but aamir and madhavan be so vehement and insistent that it become a question in we mind also . when I be in Ladakh for the shoot , I start to feel that maybe they suggestion hold some weight . maybe the surprise at the end would be a great way to end the film . so I change it and rewrote it in Ladakh a day before the shoot . frankly , I still do not know which route be better . actually , it be a matter of interpretation . both route be correct in they own way . 335 chatur 's speech scene be a complete departure from the raju hirani sensibility and the overall vcf sensibility . there be also varied opinion about the shloka at the end of the speech . be there any apprehension at the time of write this ? rh : I be aware that what we be do with this film , we have not do before . there be also complete awareness of the fact that we might be pan for use what people might label as toilet humour . there be rag scene with boy in they underwear . the language be of a certain quality and other thing as well , but while write , we realise that the campus world we have create would look completely false if we do not use the language , the irreverence of youth , and the whole college milieu while create it . this be the way this world be and , therefore , we job be to stay true to this world . this be the necessity of this world . this scene we crack when abhijat and I be in Columbus , Ohio ( April 2007 ) . the decision that rancho will change chatur 's speech be already in place but we have not work out the detail of the scene yet . we decide to make it more challenging for ourselves . it would have be easy to change the entire speech but if only a few word be to be change , then it would have be tough . therefore , the challenge be to write a speech that , if keep in its original format , sound great but if you be to change just a few word in it , then it would become completely different . we struggle for many day to find the right word . we have think about many word and many idea but nothing be good enough . we want it to rhyme too . one day , we be out for a drive and we hit upon chamatkar 's and ' balatkar 's . but after use this a few time , we feel that we need a change because carry a entire speech only on a single word change might get monotonous so the hunt for the second word start . I be in Ohio then , visit abhijat . we be out for a walk when the second word strike we ( dhan 's and ' ttan ) . abhijat 's daughter anoushka ( age 12 ) be also with we . while abhijat and I be talk , we crack this and abhijat almost fall down laugh . we be both in split but we could not share this with anoushka . the shloka at the end be another story . it be not there in the scene . while write the screenplay , we have rent a small farmhouse in pune where we use to go and write very often . during one of we write sojourn in this farmhouse , in some other context and not in the context of this speech scene , abhijat tell I this shloka . laugh to the point of tear . I decide there and then that I want it in the speech scene and it be incorporate at the end of the scene . since chatur already have this trait of farting and be call silencer by everyone , the shloka fitte 336 in perfectly . but Vinod feel we should take it out . later , even abhijat feel the same . but I be very keen to retain it . during the edit , Vinod say that the scene be too long and we should take out the shloka but vir ( Vinod 's elder brother ) who see the scene be in split and do not want I to touch it . I really want it to be in the film so I be happy that eventually everyone come around to it . VC : ( blush ) I be very shocked by that shloka . but vir love it and I test it through screening on other people and they die laugh too . my objection have nothing to do with sensibility because as raju say , one have to adopt the sensibility of the film and not some general sensibility . therefore , there be no sensibility issue here . I just feel that the scene be get too long and might be a bit of a stretch . my biggest concern be always that the audience should not be bored . aj : the speech scene be hilarious but I must say that it be not in the script just as a set piece for humour . it be the illustration and the turn point for the clash of the ideology which be the key element in the film . rancho protest against rote learn that we education system encourage . he be completely against it . the ' definition of a machine 's scene introduce that . the speech scene illustrate the ill of follow blindly without understanding the meaning of thing . it show that chatur be end -orient whereas rancho worry about the journey . with the speech , the battle of the philosophy become a open battle . right after this scene , we have the scene where chatur and rancho lay a bet to meet after ten year to see who be more successful . the speech scene leat to the progression of this theme in the film . the shloka at the end be another story . I know that if I tell raju this , he would immediately want it in the film and that be what happen . later in the edit , I too be unsure about it like Vinod and like he say , it be not because of any sensibility issue . it be because I feel that rancho probably would not meddle with the speech to this extent . he would change just two word and that would be enough for he to drive the point home . but I be glad that raju and vir prevaile in the end because the shloka be the pitce de rÃ©sistance of the speech scene ( laugh ) . the delivery scene have invite a lot of mix reaction from a section of the audience . I remember you tell I that you begin this film by first decide on the climax because that be a huge challenge you face while write lage raho ? frankly , what be you people think when you decide on this as the conclude episode in the film ? 337 rh : the origin of this scene be from munna bhai m.b.b.s.1 have think of this scene where munna get admission into medical college . he have only do this to spite asthana . he have no other motivation to study at a medical college other than he disdain for asthana . one night , he be roam the street with circuit . they be drunk . munna be wear the doctor 's white jacket so that he feel like a doctor . there be a Mumbai bandh 's that day . both of they be crossing a chawl . a boy come run out of the chawl and be hunt for a auto-rickshaw . his mother be pregnant and she water just break . he have to rush she to the hospital or find a doctor . he spot munna and drag munna into the chaw / because he think that munna be a doctor . this guy have no idea what to do but somehow they get through the delivery . the idea behind the scene be to get munna to realise the value and responsibility of doctor . the moment he hold the newborn , this would have hit he . now , he would really want to study medicine . the script underwent many change and this route be abandon . I have tell abhijat about it . while write 3 idiot , like I tell you earlier , we be determine to first decide the climax . abhijat and I talk a lot when we be write so this be one of the scene I mention again and abhijat say , '' why do not we use this here ? '' rancho could apply engineering for the delivery . this think combine with a short story I have read somewhere about a man who use to talk to he baby while he be still in he mother 's womb , connect with pia 's sister and ' aal izz well 's , we climax , start take shape . then , we spend a lot of time with gynaecologist to make it authentic . it become a big joke in office . whenever Vinod use to come to office and ask for we , he be tell that we have go to the gynaecologist . everyone tease we endlessly about we visit to gynaecologist . one of my friend have introduce we to Dr. sejal desai who become we guide while write this scene . she tell we about the various procedure by which a baby could be deliver . the only procedure which could be combine with engineering be the suction method . a lot of people think that this cannot happen but the scene be totally authentic and it be possible to deliver a baby like this . at every step , we consult the doctor and , in a way , we write the scene with they . a lot of work , a lot of research , and a lot of time be spend on this . even during the shoot , the doctor be there and constantly monitoring what be happen and how it be be depict . this be not one of that up in the air , fantasy thing that we have put in the film for the sake of a great climax . you have often refer to the three scene that constitute this continuous chunk in the film as the soul of 3 idiot : raju 's job interview , farhan 's conversation 338 with he father , and rancho break down when they come and tell he about they triumph . this scene have several rewrite before they take the final form in which they be in the film . why do you feel that this chunk be the essence of 3 idiot ? rh : this be the moment in the film I be most attach to and they make I very emotional . even while narrate this scene , I would often get choke with emotion . in a way , I feel , they be the crux of the film . I have always be fond of a underdog succeed . I like hope . I see victory in hope . be happy , go and do whatever you want without fear . this be what one want to say about life . we have to put a lot of work into this scene . for example , a lot of back and forth happen in order to elevate the interview scene to the level we aim to take it to . it be write and rewritten several time . initially , raju rastogi be only say thing about fear , god , and superstition and he use to get the job . I feel that the scene be flat . it lack punch and impact . then we hit upon the ' attitude 's angle which transformed the scene completely . how this happen be quiet remarkable as well . I have read a chicken soup story about a small boy who be ask by he teacher to write a essay about what he want to become . the boy write he essay describe he dream , of own a ranch one day with thousand of horse . the teacher be not impressed and tell he to alter this unrealistic aim to a more practical one . he tell he to aspire for something more achievable as the boy come from too poor a background to ever achieve this dream . he also threaten to fail he in the assignment if it be not alter . the boy come the next day and again submit the same assignment . the teacher be furious now . he tell he that he will surely get a F on this assignment . the boy say , '' you can keep you F Sir and I will keep my dream . '' I be very move by this story . I narrate it to abhijat and be itching to use it somewhere . for a year , the subconscious think be to apply this somewhere in the script but we could never find the right moment or place for it . in the end , in a different form , it be use in this scene . I think the think here be of preserve what define you . once you be willing to give that up , then that be the first step towards lose you identity and you dream . farhan 's confrontation with he father , apart from write it , be also not a easy scene to execute . even in the write of it , initially , I be not entirely satisfied with the trigger that make the father come around . I feel maybe farhan have to say more , do more . something here be not work for I . also , I be very unsure about execute the father 's change of heart . the tone , the block , the pitch , everything have to be perfect for this scene to work . I express all of this to 339 abhijat . I be very restless about this . he reassure I and say that he would do something . he write this entire scene on he own and mail it to I . what click be this gesture he suggest for farhan . the father get very angry during they conversation and come and sit down on a chair . farhan go up to he father and kneel down before he and talk to he . it be this act of deference and total submission that elevate the scene . if you notice , the tone of the scene be not of rebellion but of persuasion . farhan be ask for permission ; he be not inform he parent . he be appeal to they to let he live he dream . if they would not have come around , he would have sacrifice he dream . lastly , the scene where rancho break down be not there in the film earlier . if you look at it , there be no need for it technically because after this two scene ( raju 's job interview and farhan 's conversation with he father ) , we could have go straight to the barber shave off virus 's moustache as he have lose the bet . but I have always feel that when there be a emotion this potent , it have to play out in full . you need to see the aftermath , otherwise it appear abrupt . the trick to pace a film be as much in speed it up as in slow it down and let it breathe when the screenplay demand it . I write this scene to bring the emotion in the earlier scene to its rightful conclusion . but when we shot the scene that in its original form have raju and farhan come and hug rancho and he break down , I be not satisfied . I call abhijat and ask he about what he think of they take off they pants and say , '' jahanpanah , tussi great ho , '' to rancho . earlier this be to happen right at the end when they reunite in Ladakh . abhijat like the idea and we change it on location . we remove it from the climax of the film and bring it up to this point . instead of this boy , now chatur take off he pants at the end and say , '' jahanpanah , tussi great ho . tohfa kabool karo . '' there seem to be a design to the way 3 idiot have be write . the drama be carefully balanced with laughter . the audience do not cave in under the weight of any scene . be this intentional ? rh : this be a inherent trait in all my film . if I have my way , I would package everything with laughter . I believe in the world that I create in my film . one can choose to be cynical or one can choose to look at thing differently . if you really analyse the emotional , dramatic scene , you will notice that they incite tear of happiness and hope and not of despair and loss except for Joy 's suicide . I hate 340 sadness in film . so more than design , this happen because of the way we look at the world : we belief , experience , and idea . aj : I agree with raju but it be still gratify to see that after every dramatic scene , we manage to diffuse the tension by make people laugh within minute . in term of craft , this be a massive challenge . it can ruin a film if not do seamlessly and effortlessly . we inspiration for this be the lion King . mufasa 's death be this dark , hard -hitting , unforgettable , and memorable moment but exactly two minute later you be transport to the world of ' hakuna matata 's . we shed tear with simba , we be move and stir but two minute later we be sing '' hakuna matata 's with joy and hope . most screenplays would dwell on a event like mufasa 's death for at least ten minute . you ( raju and abhijat ) collaboration begin during lage raho munna bhai . it continue through 3 idiot and now you be write another film together . it be a delicate relationship where many thing have to come together for it to become productive . how do it work for both of you ? aj : raju and I share the same sensibility . we approach , we idea , the path that we want to take , be all the same . when raju and I write , the path that we follow be completely non-linear . we start with write the scene that we value . it be a nightmare later to string they together and beat they into a narrative . but the magic of this method be that once you do this , you have , as writer , follow such a unknown path that the audience have no chance of second guess the trajectory of the film . so we first follow the magic and pen down what we treasure most and then apply reason and bind it together . it be a rare and wonderful meeting of mind . rh : I spend more time with he than I do with my wife . I wish he be a woman ( laugh ) . apart from he be a good writer and we sensibility be the same ( we be both from small town and we have share similar experience ; we reference point be the same ) , the quality I most enjoy and admire in abhijat be that he do not defend he scene . most writer spend a huge chunk of they time defend they scene . if I want something do differently , he understand my point of view . this do not mean that he be not passionate about what he write or do not believe in he scene but it simply mean that he be ready to explore . he have a positive aura . secondly , I do not have to walk on eggshell with he . that be a huge relief . in cinema , you waste a lot of time , precious time , deal with ego because 341 everyone you be deal with be a artist . you have to think of way and mean to convey you opinion without hurt people or offend they . this house - keep I do not have to do with he . I can say what I feel without hesitation and without any sugar-coate . it save we a tremendous amount of time . and most importantly , abhijat do not give up . we could have be through a million draft but he do not get fatigue by the evolve screenplay . he keep at it . I be the same so I know that this stem from tremendous passion . even if the shoot be on and thing need to be change , he have that faith in I and I in he that if it make the film better , we will do whatever it take . this synergy be rare . before abhijat and I start work together , I never think that I would need a write partner or I could work with a write partner but now I feel it be essential to have one . the process of screenwrite and direct hold such mystery that many find it hard to figure out where to start . what would you suggestion be to student aspire to write and direct they material ? rh : I believe that formal education in some form be essential to a extent . one do not have to enrol in a institute or course necessarily but other mode of learn like read , watch theatre and film can help you gather the tool and grammar that will enable you to write and make film . but what be most critical to preserve be the faculty to think from you heart . once you get into theory which be important , we tend to lose the innocence with which film be watch earlier . we tend to view they only with a eye on the craft : there come the central conflict ; that be the hurdle in the plot ; lense just change ; and a crane be use for this shot , and so on , be what we start focuss on . we start view film purely from the perspective of craft . the ability to think from the heart and appreciate a film honestly vanish . for I , to keep this faculty to think from the heart alive be the biggest battle . this be what lead to honest work . the other thing be to try to bring in fresh idea . it be very tough to do that this day but the effort should be there to achieve this . aj : I feel that novelty of idea be paramount . anything you be write or attempt to write should not have the sound of something that have be do a hundred time before . the approach that though it have be do before but I will write it so well that it will work , accord to I , do not work . you need to feel strongly about the idea that you choose and you need to believe in it . it must sound unique to you to begin with . once you have settle on the idea , the element of time come in . a screenplay demand a lot of time and patience . the write process , in case 342 quality be the goal , can not be rush . therefore , you must be prepare to devote that time . at least two to three year . once this two commitment be make , then for the first two or three month you must not write . you must mull over the idea . where do I want to go with this think ? what be I try to say ? who be the character in my story ? why be what I be say worth say ? why should I be write this at all ? this be the question you should spend time answer in this initial month . once you have convincingly answer this for yourself , you should start the write process . a good technique be to keep two screenplays go at the same time . it help sometimes . you might love some moment but they do not work for a screenplay so you can always put they in the other one you be work on or save they for some other story in the future . so you do not hang on to you darling . but more than two screenplays at a time be a distraction . VC : the only process and method I know be consistent , relentless , passionate , and focuss hard work . let I tell you a secret . talent , as be the popular belief , be not inborn . it be something you have to work for . if you work hard enough , you can achieve anything . that be the key to it all . â€” smriti kiran 343 thing of beauty a thing of beauty be a joy forever ... â€” John keat praise this world to the angel ... show he some simple thing , refashion by age after age , till it life in we hand and eye as a part of ourselves . â€” Rainer Maria rilke Three minute of cinema time ... a young lady who hate she father 's archenemy and furiously confront he must within the next three minute break off she engagement with she fiancÃ© , fall hopelessly in love with the same archenemy , and convincingly fantasise sing a rain - drench love song with he . the girl be pia ; the nemesis she must confront be rancho ; the fiancÃ© she must plunk be suhas , the price tag ; and the song she must sing be '' Zoobi doobi 's . the question be : how do we achieve this sea change within three minute of cinema time ? raju and I ponder over this question in New York City over two cup of tea . we know with absolute certainty that we can not spend a single extra minute garnish the love story . we screenplay , complete except for this one problem , be already half - an- hour longer than we would ideally want . and the placement of the love song be particularly precarious : around the 75th minute into the film , a time when most people be itching to leave either for the restroom or for some popcorn . if the screenplay sag even for a second before the song , audience the world over would end up use the song as a restroom break . and if they do so , they would not return from such a mass exodus in time for the interval point , the biggest twist and the most crucial plot- point of the story . we can not let they go for a break . which mean pia must fall in love with she archenemy in no time at all . but how ? in Shakespeare 's Richard III , princess Anne go to slay she husband 's murderer Richard , only to get engage to he in the same scene , mesmerise by he allure . Richard later boast : '' be ever a woman in this humor woo ? be ever a woman in this humor win ? '' remind raju of the scene . raju wryly remind I that we be not Shakespeare . Point take . so how do lesser mortal achieve this effect ? through some mundane , everyday thing . some simple object , refashion age after age . in this case , it 's go to be pia 's watch . in they first meeting , rancho have see pia be reprimand by she brand - obsessed fiancÃ© for wear a cheap watch at she sister 's wedding . when we write that scene , we have not see the potential of the watch as a / eitmotif . now , in New York City , where I have follow raju from Columbus on the last leg of he US trip in the hope that we can crack the pia-rancho track before he departure to India , we decide to play with the watch and see what happen . what happen be a little miracle that a screenwriter encounter once in about three or four year . open salvo with the watch : it help rancho deflate pia 's fiancÃ© with one swift ' demo : rancho hide the expensive watch that the fiancÃ© have just buy for pia and tell he that she have lose it . this simple ruse bring rush to the fore all the maniacal materialism , brand -obsession , price - consciousness , and the sheer rudeness of the fiancÃ© . moment later , stunne and insulted , pia break off the engagement . salvo two : rancho have vanquish pia 's fiancÃ© but not yet win she over . it happen in a instant , through a single innocuous remark . he congratulate pia for show the courage in break off with she fiancÃ© and point out that ' ab tum jab chaho apni maa ki ghadi pehan sakti ho '' ( now you be free to wear you mom 's watch ) . this single sentence cause a explosion in pia 's cognitive universe . in a flash , it alter she perception , memory , reason , and finally she judgment . how do rancho know that the cheap watch she be wear at she sister 's wedding once belong to she mother ? because he could reason that the bride 's sister , otherwise dress opulently , 348 could be wear one object so humble only for its sentimental value . ergo he possess sensitivity and tenderness that she have never suspect he do ! salvo three : the next time pia meet rancho , she hold out she wrist â€” she be wear she mother 's watch . without a single word , through the semiotics of that one gesture , she convey to he that she have forgiven he he ruthless deconstruction and debunk of she father 's and she fiancÃ© 's philosophy , embrace he value and be now firmly in he camp . in fact , she love he . thus , the watch help we tide over one of the trickiest plot point that have threaten to derail we screenplay . even more importantly , it infuse rancho 's character with one quality that set he apart from almost all character before he in indian cinema â€” authenticity . when pia 's fiancÃ© be ranting about the astronomical price of the lose limited edition watch , rancho gently retort , '' meri to dhai sau ki hai yaar , lekin time wohi batati hai '' ( mine be inexpensive , but show the same time ) . [ this be a incident that we borrow almost verbatim from vidhu Vinod chopra 's life , when as a young and struggle student , he could not ignore the slight about he humble watch from a affluent relative . ) this remark by rancho be emblematic of he authentic nature and the very first over declaration of one of he many priority : value over price , passion over pragmatism , excellence over success , understanding over information , communication over jargon , education over training , knowledge over diploma , and a mother 's watch over a limited - edition watch ! all we ask of the watch be to save we a few minute . what it gift we be the kernel , the essence , the very nucleus of the film . strangely , we stumble on the extraordinary potential of object through a problem that we face very early in the screenplay , a problem that be every writer 's nightmare : a big clichÃ© . the scene : the director 's motivational speech to the freshmen on they first day at college . audience around the world have hear and witness such spiel a zillion time , range from the great bombast in patton and full Metal jacket to the lamest offering from the trashiest of campus flick . Tom stoppard , the great English playwright , come to the rescue . not in person , but in spirit â€” boleto chetana . stoppard thrive on introduce bizarre object into he play and later provide perfectly plausible explanation for they . one of he 349 play begin with a man open the door of he apartment with shave foam on he face , a bow and a arrow in one hand and a tortoise in the other to find a policeman carry a bouquet of flower stand outside . soon enough , stoppard give we a entirely convincing reason for this outlandish spectacle . inspire by stoppard 's virtuosity , the cuckoo 's nest , complete with the fake bird atop it , be bear . the director carry this strange object in he hand as he stride down the impose corridor . the audience wonder about the logic of this peculiar object , till in he speech , the director link it with competition that abound in nature : a hoel kill off its competition by push the host bird 's egg out of the nest . as the audience get involved in the story of the koe / and ruthless competition , we have successfully negate a big clichÃ© . later in the same scene , instead of end the speech with rhetoric or polemics , we take it to its climax with another object : the director take out a gleam astronaut 's pen , hold it up enticingly as the ultimate trophy for the student . through rancho 's healthy disrespect for the pen , and he archrival chatur 's salivate regard for it , we be able to immediately and wordlessly set up the clash between two conflict philosophy : obsession with success versus excellence . once again , a inanimate object be help we not merely to scale over a plot hurdle but in intensify the film as a comedy of idea . since one speech be serve so ably by two diverse object , raju and I intuitively grasp that inanimate object would play a seminal role in the story . in fact , as I have lately grow fond of say , they would form the DNA of the film . for lage raho munna bhai , we have discover about halfway through the scripting process that the DNA of the film be ' olta kar 's or do the opposite â€” the principal of inversion . for constraint of space , I can only give one quick example of this . ' when munna be ask how to deal with a boy who desecrate Gandhi 's statue , from behind he bapu answer : '' give more stone to the lad , tell he to topple all my statue . '' this be clearly inverse to the answer that the audience be likely to postulate in they head and therefore highly intrigue because they cannot second guess what will follow . throughout lage raho munna bhai , whenever in trouble , we have summon this principal of inversion . for Broken horse , another screenplay I co-authore with Vinod , the DNA be memory ; the childhood memory of a mentally challenge character . whenever face with major dilemma , he summon not he faculty of reason but the faculty of reminiscence : what he parent teach he when he be little . in every major dramatic scene , we find ourselves rely utterly on memory for solution . 350 for 3 idiot , which be be write at the same time as Broken horse , we realise that the DNA be object . object mark the comic and the tragic , the dramatic and the philosophical beat of the film with equal felicity . to chronicle the genesis of each object that serve we so valiantly for transfuse red corpuscle into we scene would fill a book longer than the screenplay . but here be the briefest account of we extend encounter with thing . the comic object the empty gift envelope , the mound of food on the plate of three friend , and most crucially , the mint chutney be irreplaceable for the comic flavour of the scene where rancho gatecrash pia 's sister 's wedding . of this , the mint chutney prove to be a powerful motif . rancho first drop it on suhas 's shoe to determine they price . we go on to use it in three more scene : a . in the song ' Zoobi doobi 's where pia imagine rancho as a chef eulogise the virtue of the '' ever-useful mint chutney that , apart from be delicious , also reveal a man 's character . '' B . the scene where a drunken pia barge into rancho 's room and he , scrupulously small town , offer she dhokla with mint chutney to distract she from she amorous advance . this lead to the memorable line about the menace name of innocuous gujarati food item like dhokla , fafda , thepla that sound like missile to pia . C . the scene of pia 's wedding , when to stop the groom from head for the altar , raju rastogi iron he clothes with a iron drench in mint chutney . as promise , the chutney reveal the groom 's character instantly as pia hear he scream out the price of he ruin wedding dress . we most innovative comic object , however , be not the mint chutney . the pride of that place must go to a object so humble , so self - efface that most people would not even remember it â€” the heart - rate monitor in the hospital where raju rastogi lay in a coma after he suicidal ' high jump 's . this object serve a extraordinary purpose . it save reel no. 7 of the film from become so grave , heavy , and weighty that it could have sink the entire film . this , by far , be we favourite reel of the film . it start with the director 's brutal act of compelling rastogi to type the letter of he own rustication â€” a act that drive rastogi into attempt suicide and culminate , after rastogi 's recovery , in the twin movement of farhan convincing he father that 351 he do not want to become a engineer and rastogi successfully face a crucial job interview . this reel be clearly the heart of 3 idiot . the problem be that scene after overwhelmingly move scene , this be also by far the grimmest , darkest , and the longest ( about 20 minute ) reel of the film . we desperately need to bring some levity , some joy to this beat of the story . since the searing dramatic scene allow no scope for comic maneuver , we come up with what I consider to be the most dare and audacious trick of we screenwrite career â€” we decide to lace the musical interlude of the song ' jaane nahi denge tujhe 's with comedy . but hold on ! swanand kirkere have write that stanzas so movingly and sonu nigam have sung they with such unbridle emotionalism that how the hell can we bring in comedy into the interlude ? well , with the help of the little heart- rate monitor . know that rastogi 's brain respond to voice despite the coma , rancho begin to tell outrageous and funny lie to he to try and revive he . though the idea be comic , we realise that it would fall flat since the lie would not elicit a response from the coma-stricken rastogi . this be where the heart - rate monitor step in . whenever rastogi respond to anything that be say , he heart rate increase and the graph on the monitor alter . the dance of this graph start draw laughter from the audience at every screen . the more outrageous the lie or the action , the more vibrant the externalisation of rastogi 's inner thought . when rancho finally utter the most outrageous lie that poor farhan would marry rastogi 's sister without any dowry , the seismic dance of the white graph reach a frenzied climax . the next moment the coma-stricken patient 's right hand move . life return to he limb , hope return to he friend 's heart and we , the writer , about to lose we comic license for non-use , get a fresh lease of life . thank you , monitor ! apart from this major object , there be many minor one that come fleetingly into the film to help we find chuckle , guffaw , and occasionally , that big explosive theatre - shaking laughter that make the year of the screenwriter 's toil totally worthwhile : the spoon at the end of the rod that rancho improvise to electrocute the urinate senior ; the single grey hair that be knead into the flour as the friend be eat rotis at the rastogi house ; chatur 's hand - crafy biscuit from San Francisco that he so jealously guard for phunsukh wangdu , the comic device that enable we to weave in the wangdu track without draw attention to it ; the urn of ash that the friend so shockingly and irreverently waylay and through the threat of immersing the ash in the sewer , blackmail the fake rancho into revealing the secret 352 of the real rancho be a imposter , thus enable we to make a long exposition dramatic and funny . pia 's helmet help we negate the sentimentality and clichÃ© of rancho 's dream [ '' pia , tum roz dulhan ke costume mein scooter pe baith kar mere sapne mein aati ho . ghoongat ki jagah apna helmet uthaati ho .... '' ( every night you ride into my dream on you scooter , dress as a bride . instead of the veil , you lift you helmet ... ) ] and last but not least , the two key to the director 's office that be flung at farhan , one by rancho and the other by the director , one from a dear friend and the other from a dread foe , one steal and the other legitimate but both throw at he with the same aim : to save a human life . the Dramatic object a chopper with a surveillance camera mount atop , rise in the air and soar . it seem to embody the joy and goodwill of the entire campus in its flight . with the crowd beneath give it rouse cheer , it continue upwards like shelley 's skylark â€” '' soaring doth thou sing , and sing ever soarest . '' rancho , remote in he hand , guide this invention to the window of its originator , Joy lobo , hope to catch he astonishment and euphoria on the mount camera ... and Joy lobo hang from the ceiling fan , a failure in he own eye . his most brilliant success , the fly camera , hover outside he window , recode the inescapable evidence of he flight from this world . this be the biggest turn point in the film . from this point on , rancho , though a imposter , live under a alias and hence keen on keep a low profile , take off he glove and take on the system . I be ashamed to admit that for one full year , for the first five or six draft of the screenplay , we have something as lame as sleep pill as the mean of Joy 's demise . peel off a few draft of the screenplay , and what you stare at be pure mediocrity ! a few ring , a wheelchair , a laptop , and a letter , this simple object provide we with the bulwark for the most important beat of the story in 3 idiot â€” the twin movement where raju rastogi , a change man after he suicide attempt , fearlessly face a job interview and farhan , unyield but loving , win he father 's blessing for leave engineering and embrace photography . without the aid of object , the scene would have need so many line of dialogue to convey the complex emotion that they would have degenerate into sermon . object help we slash the dialogue and deepen the emotion . 353 before face the job interview , raju rastogi take off he lucky ring that embody all he superstition and fear and discard they in a metallic bedpan . clang ! wordlessly , with that mutinous clang , the hitherto weak man have trash he old fearful self . later , the wheelchair be crucial to the scene when he face the interview panel . more than what he have lose , the wheelchair represent what he have gain : '' dono taange tudvaake apne pairon pe khada rahena seekha hai '' ( it take two break leg to get I up on my foot ) . the same scene , without change a single line of dialogue , with rastogi sit in a ordinary chair would never have have the same impact . a laptop versus a letter â€” that be the essence of the encounter between farhan and he father . the letter be farhan 's dream , write five year ago to he revere photographer request apprenticeship but never post for fear of break he father 's heart . rancho send it out without farhan 's knowledge and lo ! the photographer answer , invite farhan to the brazilian rainforest to work with he . now farhan stand at two divergent road , one that lead he to engineering and the other to he passion , photography . which one will he take ? at this very moment , farhan 's father be proudly show he mother the brand new laptop , a gift for farhan , in anticipation of a plush new engineering job . the laptop represent the recompense for all the sacrifice and hardship that the father have undertake for the education of he son and all he solid and conservative hope of a good life for he son . in this sense , the laptop be the exact opposite of the sense of adventure , uncertainty and passion that the letter represent . the scene become the battleground for two disparate philosophy through two commonplace object . when farhan , without a ounce of anger or bitterness , with immense love and respect , make he father see the validity of he argument , the letter win . the father tell the mother to return the laptop and buy a professional camera for he son . another such scene where two rival philosophy clash appear earlier in the film â€” the scene of the vital bet between chatur and rancho . it be a clash not of individual but of priority and value : chatur 's obsession with success versus rancho 's respect for excellence . the rival decide on a date ten year later , when they will meet and compare note on who win and who lose . while there be no over use of object in the scene , we achieve the ' concretisation 's or the ' solidification 's effect through get chatur to carve out a date on the mossy wall of the terrace . by be engrave on the wall , the date become tangible , solid , permanent . it receive a import that it lack when it be merely uttere verbally in earlier draft . chatur carve the date not merely on the wall but also on the psyche of the audience . 354 perhaps the most tell example of this ' solidification 's or ' concretisation 's of a scene be the interval point of the film . both raju and I be extremely proud of we twist : afier a long and eventful journey , the friend seem to reach rancho , but when farhan put he hand on the man 's shoulder , the man who turn and look at they be not they friend . it be a complete stranger . the friend be shocked . intermission . when we narrate this scene to Vinod , he do not share we enthusiasm . he be uneasy and restless till he realise what he be miss in the scene . a tangible deepen of the mystery . Vinod feel that without solid evidence of some kind , the audience might take the encounter with the wrong man as some minor misunderstanding , a communication gaffe that might soon be sort out . so he add a few extra second to we scene : afier meeting the stranger , farhan see on the wall , a group photo of the classmate , feature all three friend but the place where rancho sit in the real photo be now occupy by this total stranger . the wrong man . intermission . the inanimate photo provide the scene with the final turn of the screw . the nebulous mystery suddenly become concrete . the plot thicken . be I read too much into this concept of ' solidification 's or ' concretisation 's through object ? be I zealously overanalysing a moot point ? be there no major scene in 3 idiot that do not rely on object ? wrong . in fact , the most famous scene of the film , chatur 's speech that go outrageously wrong [ chamatkar versus balatkar , dhan versus sttun ] rely entirely on wordplay . so do my favorite scene : rancho 's deliberately obscure , whimsical , and wooly - head definition of book [ '' Instruments that record , analyse , summarise , organise , debate and explain information ; that be illustrate , non-illustrated , hard - bound , paperback , jackete , non-jacketed ; with foreword , introduction , table - of -content , index ; that be intend for the enlightenment , understanding , enrichment , enhancement and education of the human brain through the sensory route of vision . sometimes touch . '' ] in both this scene we relied exclusively on verbal dexterity . in one instance crude , in the other , sophisticated . do this scene , then , constitute the antithesis of my argument ? hardly . because this scene , if anything , serve to demonstrate the devastating effect of the lack of ' concrete 's understanding and ' solid 's conceptual clarity that plague we educational system . the wordplay scene be mean , as rancho would put it , to be a ' demo 's of what obfuscation , empty jargon , hyperbole , pomposity , rote learn bring upon we â€” nothing but ' balaktkar pe balatkar 's . object be we close ally for three year . like a friend that you can confidently call up in the middle of the night at the time of a crisis , we knock on the door of object every time we be in trouble . every time , they respond generously . most 355 time , like good friend , they do not make a big show of the help they have extend and remain largely inconspicuous . almost invisible . but every object I list here be now a part of what Rogers and hammerstein have famously describe as '' a few of my favorite thing . '' right from the official stamp that seal farhan 's fate at the beginning of the film , to the astronaut pen that with one signature turn chatur 's gloat victory into a humiliate defeat at the very end of the film , 3 idiot , could not have be write without dream up hundred of such object . the most menial of this object , be for I , thing of beauty . they take we hollow scene and fill they with humor or drama ; they take we most abstract concept and make they accessible . in shakepeare 's word , they give '' the airy nothing a local habitation and a name . '' â€” abhijat joshi 356 casting a spell from the suppress frustration of the hospital sweeper in munna bhai m.b.b.s , the helplessness of the retire man who break into a impromptu stripping act to get he pension , to the sparkling purity of chhote in 3 idiot , while it may be difficult for we to recall the name of the actor who play this role , they face will remain forever etched in we memory ; the character merge into this actor make the on-screen persona inseparable from the one in reality . rajkumar hirani believe that the face maketh the character . if anything come as a close second to the script in he school of filmmake , it be casting . every face visible in a rajkumar hirani film have be hand - pick by he . '' caste be half the job do as far as character in the film be concerned . sometimes , we find the right people and at time , the right people find we , '' say the man who drive he ad ( assistant director ) and casting team literally up the wall even for the right junior artist mean to provide the ' background 's in a scene . tt take raju a year to freeze on the actor for Joy lobo 's father in 3 idiot , a character that appear for barely two minute on screen . over five hundred screen test later , he exclaim with frustration , '' maybe honest face be vanish from this planet . '' the brief be to find a face that would be the epitome of selfless love , kindness , and innocence . every heart in the theatre would break when he mourn he son 's untimely death . raju 's associate , rajesh mapuskar , come to the rescue and suggest child actor , madhav vaze , from the acclaimed marathi film shyamchi ayee ( shyam 's mother ) make in 1953 . he would be of the right age now to play the role . the hunt for the actor begin and he be finally locate in pune . the only question be : have madhav 's face retain the same stir innocence it have fifty - six year ago ? one look at he and raju know he have find Mr. lobo . and sometimes , the right actor find he / she way to the right role . every project go through various stage of casting . a single change in the script could have one consider someone else rather than the actor initially under consideration for a particular role . if one be to imagine anyone other than aamir Khan as rancho , kareena kapoor as pia , or sanjay dutt as munna bhai , the entire perception and tone of this character would change in we head . the principal cast of 3 idiot come together with all the serendipitous twist and turn of a commercial potboiler . @ rancho aamir khan I never think of casting aamir in 3 idiot . in he case , it be the right man find he way to the right role . aamir , in real life , be rancho . â€” rajkumar hirani we have actually not think of aamir for 3 idiot . I happen to call he for rajesh mapuskar 's film Ferrari ki sawari . during that time , we be also in the process of casting for 3 idiot . aamir ask I if there be anything that raju be do because he be keen to work with he . I immediately call he in for a narration of 3 idiot . and just like that , we find rancho . â€” vidhu Vinod chopra in the twenty - six year that aamir Khan have spend in the film industry , he and vidhu Vinod chopra have meet and speak about several project . Vinod have offer 1942 : a Love Story to aamir but that fall through . after that , aamir become accustom to Vinod call he once every few year and invariably ask for he date for project that be to begin shoot a month later . aamir would always hear the script but decline because he need more time to prepare . moreover , he reason that if Vinod call he barely a month before the principal photography for a project be to begin , then he be anyway not the man Vinod need for the job . so when in late 2007 , he phone ring with Vinod 's name flash on the display screen , aamir assume that it be one of Vinod 's regular ' once - in- four-year 's call . Vinod have call to discuss a project still in the process of be write . the conversation go something like this ... aamir : '' yaar tu mujhe yeh sab filmein offer karta rehta hai , why do not you ever offer I a film with raju ? '' ( you keep offer I this film but why do not you ever offer I a film with raju ? ) 360 Vinod : '' bulaonga to karega tu ? '' ( ift call you , will you do it ? ) aamir : '' script achchi lagegi to zaroor karoonga . '' ( if I like the script , I will definitely do it . ) Vinod : '' to phir aaja kal aur sunn le . '' ( then come tomorrow and hear it . ) unaware that raju have a ready script or be even work on a project , aamir be stunne by the turn of event . Vinod have manage to stump he yet again . but this time thing do work out . you have express a desire to work with raju . both of you have even meet and discuss a project . why do thing not work out earlier ? I have very high regard for raju 's work and for raju as a person . the first time we meet be at the premiere of munna bhai m.b.b.s. | love the film and think it be wonderful . a little over six month after that , raju call I to discuss a idea he have for a film . this be before lage raho . 1 be travel then , but we decide to meet the moment I be back in town . after I return , raju come to meet I and tell I that thing have change . in fact , the morning of the day we meet , he decide that the idea he be to share with I , would now be use to do the second inning of munna bhai . 1 be still curious to hear of the idea . when I hear it , I think it be a fantastic idea and completely suite the munna bhai genre . and sanjay would do a great job but at the same time I feel that I have miss out on a opportunity . what draw I to raju be he unique style of filmmake . I have observe in the two munna bhai film that he view he character with a lot of warmth . so even if it be a bad guy in he film , he approach to the character be very warm . in he work , there be a certain joy and simplicity which be what appeal to I and to all of we . also , raju be a straightforward person who you take to instantly . he have a basic respect and regard for each and every person he deal with , no matter who they be . after the first narration , what be you reaction to the script ? my first reaction to the script be one of disappointment . it do not work for I and if raju have still want to make it the way it be then , I would have have to 361 opt out . I feel sad because I really want to work with he . the script have a lot of potential but it be not in place as yet . I express my reservation to raju . he hear I out and say that he agree with quite a few of my point . he tell I to give he some time and then he come back after about two month . when I hear the script the second time round , I like it . a lot of the issue I have raise and he have agree with , have be address . ' what be the problem that you have with the first version of the script that be narrate to you ? my basic problem be that rancho be too heroic in the first draft . he be cocky and belting out one smart line after another . I feel he should behave like a normal guy . for example , in the introduction scene , initially , he be heroic in the way he face the guy who be rag he . it be rancho 's attitude and not the scene that be a problem for I . the scene have stay pretty much the same as it have be earlier . rancho 's attitude do not make sense to I . a young boy who come into the first year should be scared when he face he senior . he can not be this guy who come in and churn out smart line . he come across as too confident and too sure of himself . but as I understand he , he seem to I a guy who be normal . he do not really know how to face guy who be stronger than he and be bully he . that be the reason he run away and hide in he room . the tone initially be of one - upmanship and I feel that rancho should not really care about that . I want he to be scared in the rag scene and do thing out of fear and not out of know how to handle this tough situation . similarly , in the scene where the director address the first year student and talk to they about the astronaut 's pen , have I say my line in a cocky manner , then the character would have come across differently but when the line be say with a sense of excitement as though the idea have just occur to the character , and he think it be a damn good one , so he just say it out loud because he want to share it , that take on a different colour altogether . rancho be enthusiastic about he thought and share they spontaneously but he do not know why the other be laugh because he have not say anything meaning to be funny . yet , it come across as a joke . other people find it funny . this be broadly what I have a problem with . it be the crystallisation of the core think that I be excited about : what the film be try to say â€” chase excellence and not success â€” and this be what I want come through in rancho . 362 you be not convinced about play a 20 - year - old student in the film . what make you change you mind ? when I read the script , I do not feel that rancho be I because rancho be a naturally brilliant guy and I do not see myself as that . rancho 's philosophy in life all along I have be follow but as a personality he be a little quirky . I do not see myself as that . but broadly speak , how he life he life be similar to how I live mine but when I be read the script , I do not see it that way . perhaps I do not see myself that way , so I could not relate myself to he . however , the interesting thing that happen be that I tell raju what I feel : '' though I love the script , how be I go to fit this role ? I be 43 now and by the time we make the film , I will be 44 and I have to play a 20 - year - old so I do not think I be the right guy for this film . I personally feel you should cast someone in that age group . '' I even offer to help he find a young actor for the role . my fear be that fundamentally if people do not accept I as a 20 - year -old , then the whole film would go for a toss . and that would not be worth it . you be make a entire film . there be too much hard work involved so why should you let the fate of the film hinge on a weak point . you lead actor be 44 and he be go to play a 20 - year-old . despite not be convinced of it ourselves , if we still go ahead and shot the film , and it look bad , then what be we go to do ? this be when raju speak to I at length . I think during we interaction lead up to this conversation , raju have become increasingly convinced about I play rancho . maybe to start with , he be not totally convinced . I do not know what be go through he mind but I feel that somewhere along the way , he become surer about I do the film . perhaps the interaction help he in he head as well . the first thing he say be that he think I look young . second , he feel that I could pull it off as I have often pull off thing that people have not expect I to . he give I the example of ghajini . his logic be that if I could pull that off , why not this ? I keep counter he by say that there be limit to what one can do physically . lastly , he say , '' throughout you career , you have be like rancho . you have take path that be unconventional . you have not follow any rule . instead you have break they . you have chase excellence and success have come after that . when you play rancho , the audience be go to believe you as oppose to some other actor who have be chase success in reality but spout this line on screen . you will bring a lot of credibility to the character and that be why I want you to play it . '' this be what he opinion be but I keep insist on find a young actor . this discussion go on . what eventually help I make up my mind be raju 's faith in I . we spend 363 a lot of time together and discuss many draft of the script and throughout the process raju be certain that he want I for the role . I instinctively trust raju as a director . I trust he judgement and instinct . I might not be able to see myself in a particular way but if the director be able to see I that way , and feel enthuse and excited about it , then that be important to I . I be so glad he push I . I decide to go with raju 's judgment . his faith in I , my intense desire to work with he and , of course , what he be make convinced I to take on the challenge . once you be convinced and you sign the film , what be you approach to rancho ? I feel rancho be boyish and transparent . he have a clean heart so most of what he think and feel be quite evident to people . have I actually be 20 year old , I might have play the character differently . I do not know how I would have play it but it would have be different . at this age , I have the additional burden of pull off play a guy half my age . I have to approach he differently . I have to work on my mannerism and the way I look to cut the age . I be really bulk up for ghajini so I lose a lot of muscle . I try to look as small as possible in order to look boyish . I wear oversize clothes . I have to internalise the mannerism because if you do not internalise they , they come out totally fake . in my head , when I be construct he , I feel he be a guy who be constantly move . his mind be buzzing . so he seldom stay still . he be either scratch he head , shifting from one foot to the other or shaking he head . he be quick . there be so much go on in he head that he have a lot of buzz in he . that be how I see he . and because he be transparent , all that be go on inside he come out spontaneously . this trait help I negotiate the smart line because the line be very smart . I feel that if he be so smart , confident , and cocky , then he will become a pain in the neck after a point . to make he likeable , the audience have to feel he be innocent . let I give you a ' demo 's ( smile ) . one of my toughest scene in the film be when rancho confront the director after Joy 's death . that be some pretty heavy line . you might feel that thing but to actually go and tell the head of you educational institute all that and to actually provoke he without be ask anything be a rather extreme thing to do . the insinuation of rancho 's word be severe . how do one pull this off ? raju and I even consider at one point to have rancho drunk in this scene but then we do not go down that route . the best way then to go about it , and which be what I do , would be to play he as emotionally overwrought . he be so grief-strick that he go and say what 364 he feel without think of the consequence . and the only way to balance the outspokenness of the earlier scene would be to show a degree of fear when he be in the director 's office the next morning . he be not take on the director or play this like a challenge . he be make a plea . I be say a lot of harsh thing to the director and , therefore , I can not come from a position of arrogance . basically , I play rancho with a different attitude . he be just be plain honest because he be innocent enough to be honest . he might be scared but he have to say what he feel because that be who he be . the smart line , I know , need to be retain but as a actor , I have to say they in a way that make they palatable . farhan and raju , as character , be most likely to have the audience behind they because most people would identify either with farhan or with raju . rancho be a man you admire but not someone who evoke sympathy or empathy . be this a concern for you ? I be aware of this but it be not a concern for I . one of the problem with rancho , speak from a purely dramatic point of view , be that he have no flaw . when the character do not have flaw , you may admire the character but you do not emotionally connect with the character because he do not have any problem . he do not need you help . and he be succeed in whatever he do , therefore , there be no sympathy or empathy for he . as a audience you do not emotionally invest in he . for example , in taare Zameen par , you heart go out to ishaan because you see the trouble he be go through . you be totally behind he as a viewer . it be a very author- back character . the character in 3 / diot with the potential of a strong emotional connect with the audience be farhan and raju . this be the two who have problem . there be a growth in this character that result in they transformation through the film . in rancho , there be no growth . he be the same from the beginning to the end . it be a very big challenge for I to play rancho because emotionally he be not author-back . his only problem be that he love pia but can not marry she . but that be not the main plot . this be another reason it be essential to not make he oversmart . he would have get on everyone 's nerve . I warn raju about this in the beginning that we would have to be careful with this guy or he would be in danger of go overboard . I tell he that he would have to be careful as a director and watch out and not let I slip up anywhere . and I think somewhere what work for rancho be the screenplay because the screenplay really support he . the story be about two friend who be look for 365 they friend . it be through they intensity , they warmth , and they love for this guy that the audience emotionally connect with rancho , whenever I read the script , I always cry in farhan 's scene with he father and raju 's job interview scene but I never cry for rancho . I never feel bad for he . it be a task to engage with he emotionally . that come from the bond and love that sharman and maddy bring for rancho in they performance . the warmth they feel towards rancho seep through to the audience . again , at another level , the screenplay be very clever because throughout the film , you be look for rancho and you have only see flash of he through farhan 's eye . we have not meet he as yet . you meet he head - on only at the end where he be himself and not a person who be be look at from someone else 's point of view . the tenderness , love , and warmth the three friend share warm the viewer to rancho . the emotional high point for rancho 's character be when he sit around wait nervously for he friend to return from the situation ( farhan confront he father and raju go for a job interview ) they have go to face , and the moment he realise that they have return triumphant from this situation , he break down . you be not convinced about Joy 's suicide be in the film for a long time . you oppose it vehemently . why be that ? at the script level , I feel that it might not be necessary . the point be come through in any case . it be accomplish through virus 's character as he son have commit suicide . but the actual reason be a connect thing . if the suicide be retain , then the two scene that come right after it would be very tough to negotiate for I . I be not convinced that people would buy that scene because , like we just discuss , rancho be say some very provocative and harsh thing to the director . see , either the tone of the film be at such a high pitch that say all this to the director be alright because the entire film be like that , but we be not do that . so this worried I . the graveyard scene and the scene after that be tough . right after that be the classroom scene where he be challenging the authority of the director and get away with it . that line be a very tricky one : '' nahin Sir , mein aap ko engineering nahin sikha raha , mein to aapko yeh sikha raha tha ke padhate kaise hain . '' ( 1 be not teach you engineering Sir , I be teach you how to teach ) . I think the audience would beat we for this . I have to really struggle to carry this off . I think it would be best for rancho to say this cheekily , pick up he bag , and bolt out of there . if I have say this line in a heroic way or in 366 a manner which suggest that I be take on the director , then we would have be doom . but come back to Joy 's suicide , in hindsight , when I see the film , I think raju be right about keep the suicide just like he be right about all the decision that he take . the principal photography of the film begin in August 2008 . the scene in Ladakh , the climax of the film , if not shot in the first schedule would have have to be shot after a year as Ladakh be only accessible for a few month a year . the decision be make to shoot the climax in Ladakh in the first schedule itself . do you think it would have affect performance have you people shot it at the beginning and not a year later which be what you have to do because of terrible weather ? I be very relieved that we could not shoot the entire climax then even though it be a terrible experience for the entire team . we shot for a day and then bad weather hit . it be scary how we evacuate everyone to safety . but all be well that end well . we performance would have suffer because we have not live that character as yet . especially mine . at least sharman and madhavan have shot in bengaluru for the first few scene of the film and , therefore , have forge some sort of a connect but my first day of shoot for 3 / diot be in Ladakh . I tell everyone that I be very happy because it would certainly have compromise the credibility we be able to bring in when we shot for it after shoot for the entire film . you actually drank for you drunken scene . method act ? I actually find it difficult to do drunken scene without drink . it help my performance if I actually drink and perform . I believe in aide . my goal be to give my best performance and if anything help in achieve this , I be happy to use it . I be not one of that people who shy away from use thing that can enhance they performance and eventually the film . what do you think be the core of 3 idiot ? chase excellence and not success be definitely the core think . to put it differently , do what you believe in and what make you happy . what make you happy may not always be conducive to what we commonly understand as success . farhan want to be a wildlife photographer and it may not appear to people that he may 367 be successful do that even in the conventional way . for this , first one need to understand what success be . do what make you happy and do it well be success . it may get you less monetary benefit . however , it may also get you good monetary benefit and one must not discount that . so you may get success in the conventional way as well by do what make you happy but the key be to do what make you happy , what be fulfil to you . that be the core think of the film . fl pia sahastrabuddhe : kareena kapoor the first thing I do be to ask kareena to put on weight . even when she be shoot for other film , I would send she message say , '' hope you be eat kareena . '' pia have to be real and feisty . â€” rajkumar hirani I see she in omkara and jab we met . in my opinion , of all the actress we have , she be one of the finest . it be a natural choice to go for a fine actress . â€” vidhu Vinod chopra on a crisp November morning in 2003 , kareena kapoor wangle a day off from she hectic schedule and head for gaiety galaxy , one of the oldest single - screen cinema hall in suburban Mumbai , to catch the first show of the latest release that week . she walk out of the hall mesmerise . a quick call be make to she manager , Zahid , from the parking lot of the hall enquire about the man who have direct the film she have just see . Zahid gush : '' he be God ! he be God ! do not know he name but he have direct over 200 advertisement . '' he promise to get back with detail . the film kareena have see be munna bhai m.b.b.s. and its first - time director be rajkumar hirani . his name be immediately scribble in the wish list of director in she diary . kareena 's mother , babita , tell she to play she sindhi card with he if need be : '' just tell he , ' my mother be sindhi just like you and , therefore , you must work with I . 's you have want to work with rajkumar hirani and aamir Khan for a long time . 3 idiot present the opportunity to work with both . how do this fall into place for you ? ' we meet at mukesh ambani 's party in December 2007 . before I could go and talk to he , he come up to I and tell I how much he like my work in jab we met . 368 then he say the magic word : '' I be do a film with aamir and I might have a role for you . '' I jump and tell he that I be game and he do not even have to narrate it to I . but raju insisted that I hear it and then let he know how I feel . he be write at the time and promise to call the moment he be do . when a month pass by without a word , I message he . this time , he ask I to wait for a week , and exactly a week later , raju call and tell I that he have finish and I be call in for a narration . I go for the narration with absolute certainty that I would do this film . nothing be go to change my mind . I hear the script . my first reaction be that this film would create history and I want to be a part of it . I know that the film belong to the ' 3 idiot 's and my role in term of screen-time would be small but this would be a ground - break film and only a fool would pass up this opportunity . I have work in this industry for nearly a decade and this be the most real and evocative screenplay that I have ever hear . also , it be my chance to work with raju hirani . the simplicity and romance in he work be unmatch . he do not have to travel to Paris , New York , London , San Francisco , or build opulent set or drape actor in designer wear to create magic . he play with the magic of moment , of silence , and of life . he just move you and stir something deep within . I be in and nothing be go to change my mind . with raju , you get aamir as a bonus . it take a decade for you and aamir to come together . surely there must have be opportunity before this ? there have be opportunity before this but nothing work out . I be suppose to do ghajini but when murgadoss approach I for ghajini , I have already sign mani ratnam 's lajjo with aamir . aamir call I and say that he could not do two back - to- back film with I . I opt out of ghajini and stay with lajjo . unfortunately , lajjo be shelve . vishal bharadwaj be also suppose to do a project with we . aamir and he have creative difference over the script so that get scrapped as well . basically , every project we be suppose to do do not happen . I would often bump into aamir and complain . he keep assure I and promise that he would give I one of the best film of he career . and today that have happen . it almost feel like a dream . I be in 3 / diot and it be aamir Khan 's best film ever . he be very lucky for the kapoor sister . both , karisma and I have give super blockbuster with he . I keep teasing aamir : '' you do one film in three year so I do not know when another heroine will get a chance to work with you . it will probably be my niece samaira ( laugh ) . '' aamir be truly a genius . he be a gift to work with . 369 pia be very different from the role you have do so far . what be you approach to pia ? pia be real . she be spontaneous and outspoken . I have receive more accolade for pia than I do for goot from jab we met . goot be euphoric , mad , and larger than life . every girl want to be like goot but pia 's usp be that she be every girl . she touch a cord across all age group . I be shoot kurbaan around the same time as I be shoot for 3 idiot . kurbaan be such a intense role . 3 idiot , on the other hand , be very real and this be role much tougher to play because then a heroine have to break away from she identity and image and reveal a part of herself . this be where raju 's brilliance come in . on the set of the film , I become pia and that 's what everybody see . kareena vanish for the time that I be shoot for 3 idiot . and pia have make such a impact that it have leave I speechless . I know this would happen and that be why the length of my role be immaterial . no one ever think of I as kareena here . though I be the only actor in the film who be do multiple project at the time , I give priority to 3 idiot as it be the first film I be do with raju , Vinod , and aamir . at the time of the narration , I be sure , you must have look forward to the confrontation between pia and she father ( virus ) . that be the one scene that belong to you . be that a part of the extensive rehearsals that be hold before the principal photography for the film begin ? this ia my favourite scene in the film . when I hear this scene , I know that this would be my big opportunity and the centrepiece of my performance . I be determine to nail it . I have come fully prepare for it . raju be very keen that I rehearse this scene . I be a spontaneous actress and too much rehearse do not help I . raju listen to I which be very nice of he . I request he to just roll the camera . I feel that the entire scene be set up in such a way that the only way to approach it be to be spontaneous . the scene begin with pia clear the table and you can feel by the way she be put away the plate and the spoon that she be go to explode . this be do in a single take . I do not know what get into I but I do not use glycerin . the moment I finish the shot , I expect to hear some kind of a sound but there be complete silence on the floor . I panicked and think I have mess up the scene . raju remove the headphone . he have tear in he eye and the entire crew give I a thunderous applause . I be prepare for this scene for a while and I know if I do not get this right , then there would be trouble . 370 you do a drunken scene on screen for the first time in you career in 3 idiot ? what be that experience like ? raju be really worried about this scene . I have never ever do a drunken scene and I be a teetotaler . this stretch on for fifteen to twenty take . drunken scene be not easy to do . it be very tough to get the consistency of drunkness and the slur have to be the same . to make the job at hand tougher , this be a sync-sound film . aamir help I a lot in that scene . he tell I to look at the centre of my forehead so that my eye look a little cross . raju even tell I that I could drink if that help I perform . this boy have do a drunken scene earlier and they have actually get drunk for it . aamir keep on tell I to have a glass of wine . I tell they that this route would not work for I because if I have any alcohol I would just fall asleep instantly . there be so many take we do . finally , raju ask we to wrap up . I think he be feed up . he say he would manage something in the edit . I be feel terrible think maybe I could not deliver as per expectation . but then the film release and people go wild about the dhokla - fafada scene . fan message I dialogue from the scene and I go crazy with the kind of response I get . raju be aghast because he have use a ' no - good 's take . normally , actress in Hindi film do not get the opportunity to do a drunken scene and when they do , it be a tough one to nail . I be happy that people give I such a overwhelming response to my first drunken scene . saif have work with Vinod chopra film in parineeta and eklavya . he know everyone well . any advice he offer before you take on the film ? during the make of ek / avya , raju have speak to saif about 3 jdior but at that time he be still write . shahrukh Khan step in later but then eventually aamir do the film . this change be common in the industry as thing keep change accord to how the script pan out . maybe 3 / diot be not mean to be for saif but he be so happy when he get to know that I be go to be in it . he be constantly on the set with I and he see the film in the office before the first print be out . he be completely floor by it . he keep say , '' what have they make ? how be we ever go to surpass this ? what have they do ? everything will now fall short of 3 / diot . '' even though he have just give a huge hit â€” Love aajkal â€” the same year , he be one actor who be genuinely happy for we team . he be very close to Vinod , raju , and aamir , and be there throughout the make of the film . he be as much a part of the 3 idiot team as I be . 371 hf viru sahastrabuddhe : boman irani boman have to be a part of all my film . after school and college , it be difficult to make lifelong friend . boman be one such friend I have make . he be the only actor I want for this role and he do not have a choice but to agree to play virus . he be a friend and I can completely take advantage of that friendship . â€” rajkumar hirani raju and you relationship organically develop into one that go beyond film . you interaction on a film be not restrict to just discuss the character you be play . you be a integral part of he idea team and long discussion revolve around the script between you and he be a essential part of raju 's creative process . what be you reaction to the idea and the script of 3 idiot the first time you hear it ? raju tell I about buy the rights to five Point someone when we be in Leeds for iifa ( 2007 ) . raju be there to pick up the best director award for lage raho . I be very surprised that raju have buy the rights for this book because my first reaction to it be : '' what be you go to do with the book ? the novel in itself do not seem like material for a film . '' raju tell I that he and abhijat be work on the screenplay . a few month later when raju and I be on a flight to nagpur , he narrate the script to I and I love it . I have my concern which we discuss over several subsequent session but what they have do with it be fantastic . you be reluctant to play virus because you think it would be in broad stroke a repeat of asthana from m.b.b.s . why be you apprehensive about virus and what convinced you ? I be offer this role even by the guy who be plan to make five Point someone earlier but he could not get the project off the ground . the first time I hear the character , I feel irfan Khan would be very interesting in this role . for I , this seem a lot like asthana from m.b.b.s. though raju keep tell I that it be different . eventually , I realise that I do not have a choice . I would have to do this . T could not say no to raju . once that be settle , raju and I get down to work on the character , flesh it out and give it body . a lot of people feel that virus be more a caricature than a character . what do you feel about that ? 372 virus come across as a caricature because , with all due respect , we teacher who have be teach for many year do become somewhat caricature of themselves . I feed on that . I play that up and that be why he seem caricature -ish . raju and I travel to pune for a weekend . while write 3 jdiot , they have hire a farmhouse there which be use for write session . for two day we sit and work out virus . I want this man to be special . I think of he as dark and edgy with cussedness be the underlying trait more than anything else . the tone be of sarcasm . he have a mean streak . then we start pad he up with quirk to embellish he character . the idea be also to take virus away from asthana as much as possible . we give virus this unruly dense crop of hair on he head . instead of suit he wear this ill-fitting clothes belong to another generation . I borrow a lot from people I know in real life . interestingly , virus 's daily ritual of the power nap whilst listen to opera and get he shave do be draw from mahatma Gandhi 's life . he do not listen to opera but he be a very busy man . he have tell he staff to cut he nail and shave he whilst he take a nap . this way he save time . this be we reference point for the quirk we add to virus 's character . then I want he to lisp . for that I have to rehearse for month because if it do not look natural , it could go very wrong . another of my favourite be that virus have to be ambidextrous . I have call up abhijat and raju in America to discuss this with they . they love it . be ambidextrous be a mark of genius and my perception of virus be that he be a genius . he be not a ordinary guy but he have choose to devote he life to number instead of apply himself to great pursuit . the only thing that we change be he body language . earlier , I think that it might be interesting to have a man who constantly speak about life be a race and he every habit be gear towards save time , be laborious and slow in he own movement . he walk and move slowly , but during the rehearsals this do not work at all so we change it . all this really help in uplift virus as a character . this be you first film with aamir Khan . he be the protaganist and you be the antagonist so to speak in 3 idiot . what be the experience like ? this script be narrate to everyone from hrithik to shahrukh . I have no idea why aamir be not consider but eventually he be the one who do it and be a perfect fit for the role . he be amazing to work with in all respects â€” calibre , 373 commitment , courtesy . the experience of work with he be special . the define thing about aamir be that , the equation be not of two co-star work together but of two colleague , two collaborator . no one be work at cross purpose . all of we become a team and we goal â€” the film . during the interview , everyone tell I that raju pamper you more than anyone else on the set ? be that true ? who tell you that ? tell I ? ( laugh ) be sharman , raju , and aamir joke about this ? I be sure they be . this be just what everyone say . he pamper everyone . no special favour extend to I . hf raju rastogi : sharman joshi sharman be on my radar since the time my wife , manjeet , and I have see he work in style . we have both really like he and I want to work with he whenever the right role come along . â€” rajkumar hirani sharman joshi would have frequent the theatre more have he know that movie watch would reap such rich benefit . in early 2007 , sharman get out of globus , a theatre in bandra ( Mumbai ) and notice raju hirani with he team in the compound of the cinema hall . sharman have always want to work with raju . though tempt to walk up to he and introduce himself , sharman hesitate think that this might not be the right place to approach he . but he be pleasantly surprised when on spot he , raju smile and wave at he . confidence boost , sharman walk up to he . but bigger surprise be in store for sharman that night . raju tell he that he have a role for he but since he be still in the process of write , he would get in touch with he soon . sharman go home in a daze . how do 3 idiot come together for you ? I believe that the restroom at various multiplex have play a important role ? ( smile ) the first time raju Sir tell I he have a role for I be at a chance meeting in the compound of a cinema hall . though I do not get a call from he for a few month , after that I know that the offer be for real . the very first time 374 you meet raju Sir , you can feel the honesty and sincerity . he be not the fi/ mis lingo sweet - talk type . so I be assure in my mind that something would come out of we meeting . but as luck would have it , we bump into each other once again at a multiplex ( pvr in juhu ) . we meet in the restroom after the film be over . we stand there chat for 15 minute . again , a few month pass by . uncannily , we bump into each other in the restroom of the same multiplex yet again but this time during the interval . raju and I joke that slowly we be inching towards the beginning of the film . Three chance meeting at cinema hall be rather weird . finally , we connect and I go and meet he at he office . the first meeting be suppose to be a casual one but I think raju be so excited and happy that he narrate the entire script to I . this would be approximately six month after we first meeting in the compound of a cinema hall . shahrukh be do the film at the time when I be sign on . then there be a eight - month break where shahrukh be not do the film and eventually aamir come in . once aamir come in , I be constantly in touch with raju but during the in - between period , I do not bother he at all . that 's how this whole thing happen . what be you first reaction to the script ? I love the script and even though they still have to make the final decision about I , I go out that night and celebrate . I do not even know which character I would play â€” farhan or raju â€” if I be do the film . I honestly love both character so it would not have matter to I which one I would play . initially , shahrukh be play rancho but later aamir come in , and once he do , I audition for both the part . I have read five Point someone so for the first script narration I have come with some pre-conceive notion about the different role in the film . for example , in the book , alok 's character be rather weak . I be a little worried about that . but once the script be narrate to I , the character be completely different and be not weak . by the time aamir be finalise , formal meeting happen , script narration start , and then the audition . I be comfortable play either part because I feel both have a lot of scope for a actor in term of meat and challenge . what be beautiful about work with raju be that for every little change , raju involve everyone . his humility be on a different level and he truly and honestly respects every individual . I be pleasantly surprised that raju give I a pen and pad and ask I to jot down what I feel about the film and 375 if I have any input , this could be discuss . he like participation , and , most importantly , that participation be truly appreciate . I audition for the role with the scene in the director 's office after we be catch gate - crash he daughter mona 's wedding . it be the one with '' Sir aapki per plate cost kya thi '' . at that time , madhavan be not there so I have audition with another actor . I be draw to the script because it be about find yourself . the scene where farhan confront he father and he job interview be the core of the film . I love the human element in the film and the journey of this two friend who find themselves through various experience . you say that you audition for both raju and farhan ? do you seriously like both the role equally ? raju Sir be raju Sir give I the option of audition for whichever role I want to play . this he do in the first meeting itself . like I say , I have go there with pre-conceive notion so I have my apprehension . I tell he what I feel about alok 's character . he just smile and narrate the script to I . after the narration , he ask I the same question . my answer this time round be whichever one he would like I to audition for . I have understand that both the character be solid . he make I audition for raju . then , after a few week , he make I audition for farhan . eventually , he make I play raju 's character . frankly , this film be so well etched out that I really do not have to do much . this script be remarkable and equally remarkable be the way it have be execute . for a actor , half the job be already do . before the first schedule begin , I read the script many time over . I know the progression of the entire script from any give point in time . the script be the Bible , therefore , whichever scene we shot for , I play the script back in my head , follow the progression and perform it accordingly . my lifeline on the set be the script , raju Sir , and my instinct . for all the drunken scene in the film , I believe you people actually get drunk . ' what be that experience like ? we have a blast shoot the water tank scene and the one after that at the director 's house . it be so much fun . the night at the water tank go a little out of hand . 376 we give lengthy take . the production team finally ask we to get on with it as they be run out of stock though I do not think that be the case . I think they just want we to pack up ( laugh ) . the night after that , we be at the director 's house . Vinod chopra be with we that night so he also drank with we in aamir 's trailer . after a few drink , he say : '' koi bhi bahar ka dekhega to kahega ke kaisa producer hai , khud bhi pee raha hai aur apne actor ko bhi pila raha hai . shoot late ho gayi to kya hoga ? '' ( if anyone from outside the unit be to see we like this , he would wonder what kind of a producer I be â€” not only be I drink but I be also make my actor drink . what will happen if the shoot get delay ? ) not by design but by chance , aamir , madhavan , and you be finalise as the ' 3 idiot 's and you have work with each other before in rang de basanti . what be it like on the set ? I be ecstatic when aamir come in . we already have a equation . I know how fabulous life be go to be on the set and that make I very happy . then I discover raju Sir on the set and he be a pleasure as well . I be not sure how raju Sir would be on the set . I think he be a bit paranoid in the first schedule . there be a lot of responsibility and pressure on he . he need to be extra careful . I start to feel the pressure too . it be a raju hirani film with aamir Khan and , predictably , there be a lot of expectation . I could feel and realise how important it be for raju Sir to set the right tone on the set from the beginning . once that be do , raju Sir transformed and everything lighten up . there be a comfort factor with aamir and maddy . also , raju Sir really pamper he actor . I use to tease he about pamper boman more and boman would protest wildly . there be a complete sense of freedom with raju Sir . you be allow to perform a scene whichever way you want to and try option if you feel they might lend something to the scene . he be very caring towards every individual on the set and this be what transfer onto the screen . hf farhan qureshi : madhavan madhavan come in because we be look for a competent actor to play farhan . I have my doubt about madhavan only because of he weight , which he promise I he would shed but I catch he eat kulfi once . after the kulfi , the confidence dip even lower but then I be pleasantly surprised with he competence and he have do exceedingly well . â€” vidhu Vinod chopra 377 he watch secret , the screen adaptation of Rhonda byrne 's eponymous bestsell book . amongst other thing , secret talk about quantify desire by put they down on paper . he do just that and write down the name of all the director he want to work with . raju hirani 's name top the list . Three week later he receive a message from raju hirani . the next day , madhavan board a flight to Mumbai . you be approach for munna bhai at the time raju be think of make it as a television series . what be the meeting like ? I do not remember meeting raju for the television series . I be approach and we have meet but I have no recollection of the meeting . it be only when munna bhai m.b.b.s. release that I come to know that it be this particular film that raju have want to make for television for which he have approach I . I remember see munna bhai m.b.b.s. and say where have this guy be hide all this while . it be a sign of greatness to be able to say so many thing in the simple manner . he strike I as a filmmaker and not merely as a director . I desperately want to get in touch with he . I remember gush and rave in the message I send he after watch the film . he immediately call I back and tell I that he like my work immensely . ' we meet sporadically after that at award function and social gathering . I have even approach raju to write the screenplay of ramji londonwale because I think it be a subject that might appeal to he . he be busy with lage raho at the time but he be kind enough to suggest abbas tyrewala for it . abbas be also catch up with he own film . eventually , sanjay dayma write the film . but I know the moment I meet raju that we connection be for keep . how do 3 idiot happen ? you belief be that the process start with you watch the film secret . what happen when you get the phone call ? sarita , my wife , have be tell I to get in touch with raju . she have hear that he be make a film that revolve around three engineering student . I reason with she that film do not get make that way . if raju have not already consider I for a role , it would not be right for I and I do not want to put he in a spot by call he . when I get the message from he , sarita and I sit stare at it in stunne silence . I do not know how much this have to do with secret but this be such 378 a amazing coincidence . the message be simple : '' maddy , I need to speak with you . '' even before call he back , I tell sarita that I be do a film with raju . then I call up raju and he politely ask I to meet he whenever I be in Mumbai next . I tell he , '' I be come tomorrow . '' I remember go to he office and meeting he . he narrate the script to I which make I laugh and cry at the same time . I immediately offer to give he a screen test . he be aghast but I insisted . I pick out two scene from the script . one of they be eventually not in the film . this be the scene where one of the puppy I have grow fond of in the hostel die and I get drunk and react . the other scene be the scene with my father in the film where I tell he that I do not want to pursue engineering . raju be not go to take a decision right then even though I could see that he be convinced . he say that he would let I know . I do not hear from he for two week . then I receive a mail from he say that Vinod chopra would call I . this be somewhere in April 2008 and we be suppose to shoot in August . after wait for some more time , I call raju and ask he if I could give my date away as I have not hear from they and my other producer be wait . raju be shocked to hear this and say that I absolutely could not give away my date because we be shoot in July . apparently there be some confusion and I have not be inform . then Vinod call and thing be finalise . do you audition for both the role or be it always farhan ? farhan be the only role I related to when I hear the script . I think even raju have only farhan in mind as far as I be concerned . when raju narrate the script to I , I know that every student and every father in the country would relate to farhan . if I be able to pull this role off , then that would be my biggest achievement . what be you first reaction to the script ? the best part about raju be that he encourage we to think like the character we be to play . we feedback be consider and take very seriously . as a example , for a long time , I feel that I do not have enough of a trigger to go confront my father . initially , the letter to Andre istevan be not there in the script . I speak to raju several time about this . two or three week later , raju tell I about the idea of the letter to Andre istevan that farhan never post , and that become the trigger . I do not even know that raju have take my apprehension seriously 379 and have be work on it . raju come up with this idea and then he and abhijat plant the fact that I be a animal lover with a natural talent and interest in wildlife photography . the film start its principal photography with you scene in the airplane . ' what be you approach to farhan as he be also the narrator of the film ? the first transformation you see on screen be in farhan . so there be the additional challenge of make that believable . if the audience do not find I convincing , then it would set the wrong tone for the film . I set about work on my look first . also as a character , I go through maximum transformation . raju 's transformation happen in college after he suicide attempt . he lose he fear and there be a complete change in he attitude evident in the interview scene but farhan 's transformation in term of he personality be to happen once he leave college . there have to be a mark difference between the farhan the audience would see in the first scene and the one they would see in college . I give myself a darker , leaner , and rugge look for the portion in the present . I be a wildlife photographer and , therefore , spend time in the sun , wear that jacket with many pocket to hold thing that come in handy on a shoot and name a edgier personality . there be a aggressive dimension to farhan , the wildlife photographer . but as a engineering student , he be mild and innocent . I go completely clean shaven , chubby cheek with round boyish glass . it take we a very long time to zero in on the glass , I remember . so , I work on the look as well as the personality to make sure that the journey of the character be evident and real . hf chatur ramalingam : omi vaidya we take a huge gamble by casting omi . he have a long and important role in the film and we be casting someone for it who do not know Hindi at all . it be a huge chance we take which pay off eventually . omi be a great find . he bring credibility and believability to chatur 's character which be critical for it to work . â€” rajkumar hirani his foot be kill he . the entire day he have spend run from pillar to post take care of proceedings at a grand marathi event that he have organised in Los Angeles . a lot of people from the marathi community in America have fly in to attend the event . finally , the night be wind down and it be time to let go and have some fun . he hit the dance floor and inadvertently start dance with 380 a girl . she be a screenwriter from Michigan and he , a work actor and film director . they exchange number . four year later , the actor-director while on a visit to India to find possible buyer for he film , get a call from she â€” out of the blue . supriya kelkar , the screenwriter from Michigan be now work with Vinod chopra on Broken horse and want to give omi vaidya a head - up on a possible role in they production 3 idiot . omi vaidya might never have bag this career - alter role be it not for that random dance four year ago at a marathi night in Los Angeles . you have live in America all you life and be a work actor in LA . be Hindi cinema on you agenda ? both my parent be very supportive of my choice to pursue act , otherwise it would have be very difficult to do this . most Indians settle abroad might not have manage to do what I do . I have my family back I and that be the reason it be possible . my mother have want to become a actress but she could never pursue that desire so she make sure that at least I could follow my dream . therefore , I do not have to worry about thing like rent and food after college and be able to concentrate only on act . bollywood , strangely , be never on the radar nor be the sensibility prefer or familiar . I do not know much about bollywood film . I have see some of aamir Khan 's film . but three - hour - long film with all the dance make little sense to I and the sensibility do not hold much appeal for I either . I have see a bit of munna bhai m.b.b.s. but nothing of lage raho . all of this , I later realise , be actually a boon . it be a asset to have little knowledge of bollywood . it help I when I be shoot with the top-of- the-line actor like aamir Khan in 3 jdot . 1 be not weigh down by the awe of shoot with the biggest star in bollywood . I could perform without be hamper . how do 3 idiot happen and what draw you to the material despite no prior plan or inclination to be part of Hindi cinema ? when I get a call from supriya , I send my showreel across and raju like it because he feel that I be very boyish and , most importantly , I be not from India . initially , I be very sceptical . I inform they that I do not speak the language at all so how would this be feasible . the people schedule to audition I just refuse to listen assume that I would at least have some knowledge of the language because 381 everybody who say they do not know the language , do know a little bit . Little do they know that I really do not know the language at all . I be audition on raju rastogi 's line from the film and I be terrible . I spend some three hour in the office read the material . during the screen test , 30 second after I start say the line , the casting director start correct I and a minute into the audition , she ask I to stop . I be politely thank so I know that they have not be impressed but then I have go in know that I would fail , what work in my favour be that raju come into the office while I be meeting he team . he have some work there so I run into he . we get to chat a bit and therefore a personal connection be establish . a few day later , I receive a call from the team ask I to come in again . and this time , they say that they would send I a script for the audition . they send I a portion from munna bhai . the brief be that I would have to learn the line and not speak they . I be not to worry about speak Hindi correctly : the character be a nri though he have not be fully flesh out as yet but I be just to do what omi would do . I feel much more comfortable with this . the way I do it be that even though I know what I be say , I do it like I do not because omi would not know what he be say . so I do gesture that be absolutely not in syne with what I be say . they like this a lot . after this test , the brief for the character expand a little bit . I be tell that the character be a top honcho of a corporate concern , always in a suit with a whole lot of expensive and fancy stuff . he have come back to India to prove a point to this guy who use to make fun of he . this be what I be give to play with . I be ask again not to worry about the Hindi . if I so want , then I could do it all in English . so I do this test even better . I smoke a ciggarette and do my thing . all the Hindi word that I know be the bad word so I sprinkle what I be say with that . my mother be there with I so she be a bit shocked . I do the audition well but I be quite sure that I be not right for the role because I do not speak the language at all . I go back to LA after this test and do not hear from the 3 / diot team for a month . in LA , if you do not get a call for a week after a audition , it can be safely assume that you do not get the job . but a month later , I get a call from the production team and this time I be tell that I would be audition with scene from 3 idiot . I know then that I be in the race and , therefore , be seriously consider . then I start study the text . they give I the now famous balatkar speech scene . the other scene they give 382 I be the water tank scene where I lose my temper and the bet between rancho and chatur be make . I could see that they want to gauge whether I could do both comedy and drama . the Broken horse team be in New Mexico so I fly to New Mexico and do the audition . I give it my best shot . I give up a role to make it for this audition and I do not regret my decision . again , I do not get a call from the team for another month . then raju call I himself and tell I that though I have do a great job someone have teach I how to speak that line . he be right because my mom have teach I . he tell I to stop learn Hindi as this character would know very little Hindi . they be write he like that , therefore , if I want the role , I would have to stop learn Hindi and stop watch Hindi movie . he do not want my interpretation of the character and performance to be affect by such factor . thing work differently here than in the West . do you have any apprehension about be away from the Hollywood scene for the considerable duration 3 idiot demand you to be away ? I have my doubt because I be give up six month of my life and not be pay much accord to Hollywood standard . I worried about whether this be the right choice or not . but the very reason I choose this as my prefer field of work be because I want to be able to do new , fun , and exciting thing . this would offer all the thing I look for in a job . it be a new system and sensibility I would be operate in . therefore , I want to do this and it be my choice . also raju 's sincerity and personal email to I convinced I that I would be take care of . once I come down here and see the level of professional courtesy I be extend , the sincerity and the seriousness , I know I have take the right decision . what be you first reaction to the script ? that it be a very long one ( laugh ) . there be lot of page . I read through it but I keep my focus on chatur . I have not think of the film as a whole . I only focuss on my character . when I see the full film , that be when I realise what the whole film be all about . I really just keep my mind on chatur . also my lack of knowledge of the language keep I from understanding a lot of thing . you be already deal with language issue . I be sure there be portion in the film that be more challenging than other . tell we a little about that tough one you have to get you head around ? 383 it have to be the scene on the water tank where I be angry and drunk . I be a happy person and emotion like anger and jealousy do not come easily to I . before perform this scene , I have to separate myself from everyone to be able to do a good job . the anger and depression have to be work on . I have a three - day break before we be to shoot this scene . I request raju to let I leave the production for that three day and to just put I up in a small room or club or hotel somewhere away from everyone . raju agree and I isolate myself . when I reach the set three day later , I keep to myself and let the isolation gnaw at I . raju love my work in that scene . it take I another three day after the scene to come out of the state I have drive myself into though . ' what be the experience like for you since this be you first brush with Hindi cinema ? the whole experience be very different from America . it be very interesting . I really want to do this and I be glad I do . this be primarily because I know that raju want I and it be very rare and different from America where whether the director want you or do not want you do not matter because the corporate guy make the decision . here , the director really like I and want I and we have develop a personal connection . system -wise , thing be completely different from the West . here make - up and costume trial be do in you hotel room which be a little odd . I get the script five day before we begin shoot . though it take some get use to , all of this have its own flavour . also , I be not from here so I do not really have hang up about chat and mixing around with the driver and kitchen staff . so I could absorb a lot and get in touch with the ground reality a lot better as I chatted with this people . this guy have the most interesting storey . the other be more politically correct and talk about show business all the time . the biggest perk of the role be that I be play a fat bald guy in major chunks of the film for which I have to put on weight . I put on twelve kilogram and have a lot of fun do that because I could eat whatever I want and do not have to exercise . â€” smriti kiran 384 open credit 3 idiot a rajkumar hirani film a vidhu vinod chopra production aamir Khan kareena kapoor R. madhavan sharman joshi omi boman irani mona Singh jaave jaaferi pareekshit sahani sanjay lafont rahul Kumar Story & screenplay abhijat joshi rajkumar hirani screenplay associate vidhu Vinod chopra costume sheena parikh manish malhotra raghuveer shetty make -up vikram gaikwad charter accountant anil sekhri Chief accountant ramakant dubey senior accountant kirit parekh dialogue supervisor ranjeet bahadur direction assistant maheep dhillon menaka nagarajan Jai sharma rohan mapuskar gaurav chandelya karan narvekar mrunmayee lagoo production co-ordinator dileep desai unit production manager sarvesh Singh production manager salim qureshi sachin utekar bhavin thakkar first Assistant director vinay waikul 388 associate director rajesh mapuskar co-editor ranjeet bahadur Assistant editor gaurav chandelya action sham kaushal Visual Effects ( fable farm ) biju D. mitul Patel amol thakur background score sanjay wandrekar atul raninga shantanu moitra song & Music record sachin K. sanghvi production designer ( acropolis ) rajnish hedao sumit basu snigdha basu publicity Design rahul and himanshu nanda ( h -
