Earl rise and take a look around . the room be large for a hospital - empty linoleum stretch out from the bed in three direction . two door and a window . the view be not very helpful , either - a close of tree in the center of a carefully manicure piece of turf that terminate in a sliver of two - lane blacktop . the tree , except for the evergreen , be bare - early spring or late fall , one or the other . every inch of the desk be cover with Post - it note , legal pad , neatly print list , psychological textbooks , frame picture . on top of the mess be a half - complete crossword puzzle . the alarm clock be riding a pile of fold newspaper . Earl slap the snooze button and take a cigarette from the pack tape to the sleeve of he dress gown . he pat the empty pocket of he pajamas for a light . he rifle the papers on the desk , look quickly through the drawer . eventually he find a box of kitchen match tape to the wall next to the window . another sign be tape just above the box . it say in loud yellow letter , cigarette ? check for lit one first , stupid . Earl laugh at the sign , light he cigarette , and take a long draw . tape to the window in front of he be another piece of looseleaf paper head you schedule . it chart off the hour , every hour , in block : 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. be label go back to sleep . Earl consult the alarm clock : 8:15 . give the light outside , it must be morning . he check he watch : 10:30 . he press the watch to he ear and listen . he give the watch a wind or two and set it to match the alarm clock . accord to the schedule , the entire block from 8:00 to 8:30 have be label brush you teeth . Earl laugh again and walk over to the bathroom . the bathroom window be open . as he flap he arm to keep warm , he notice the ashtray on the windowsill . a cigarette be perch on the ashtray , burn steadily through a long finger of ash . he frown , extinguish the old butt , and replace it with the new one . the toothbrush have already be treat to a smudge of white paste . the tap be of the push-button variety - a dose of water with each nudge . Earl push the brush into he cheek and fiddle it back and forth while he open the medicine cabinet . the shelf be stock with single - serve package of vitamin , aspirin , antidiuretics . the mouthwash be also single - serve , about a shot - glass - worth of blue liquid in a seal plastic bottle . only the toothpaste be regular-sized . Earl spit the paste out of he mouth and replace it with the mouthwash . as he lay the toothbrush next to the toothpaste , he notice a tiny wedge of paper pinch between the glass shelf and the steel back of the medicine cabinet . he spit the frothy blue fluid into the sink and nudge for some more water to rinse it down . he close the medicine cabinet and smile at he reflection in the mirror . " who need half a hour to brush they tooth ? " the paper have be fold down to a minuscule size with all the precision of a sixth - grader 's love note . Earl unfold it and smooth it against the mirror . it read - if you can still read this , then you 're a fucking coward . Earl stare blankly at the paper , then read it again . he turn it over . on the back it read - p.s. : after you 've read this , hide it again . Earl read both side again , then fold the note back down to its original size and tuck it underneath the toothpaste . maybe then he notice the scar . it begin just beneath the ear , jag and thick , and disappear abruptly into he hairline . Earl turn he head and stare out of the corner of he eye to follow the scar 's progress . he trace it with a fingertip , then look back down at the cigarette burn in the ashtray . a think seize he and he spin out of the bathroom . he be catch at the door to he room , one hand on the knob . two picture be tape to the wall by the door . Earl 's attention be catch first by the mri , a shiny black frame for four window into someone 's skull . in marker , the picture be label you brain . Earl stare at it . concentric circle in different color . he can make out the big orb of he eye and , behind this , the twin lobe of he brain . smooth wrinkle , circle , semicircle . but right there in the middle of he head , circle in marker , tunnele in from the back of he neck like a maggot into a apricot , be something different . deform , break , but unmistakable . a dark smudge , the shape of a flower , right there in the middle of he brain . he bend to look at the other picture . it be a photograph of a man hold flower , stand over a fresh grave . the man be bent over , read the headstone . for a moment this look like a hall of mirror or the beginning of a sketch of infinity : the one man bent over , look at the smaller man , bent over , read the headstone . Earl look at the picture for a long time . maybe he begin to cry . maybe he just stare silently at the picture . eventually , he make he way back to the bed , flop down , seal he eye shut , try to sleep . the cigarette burn steadily away in the bathroom . a circuit in the alarm clock count down from ten , and it start ringing again . Earl open one eye after another to a stretch of white ceiling tile , interrupt by a hand - print sign tape right above he head , large enough for he to read from the bed . *** you can not have a normal life anymore . you must know that . how can you have a girlfriend if you can not remember she name ? can not have kid , not unless you want they to grow up with a dad who do not recognize they . sure as hell can not hold down a job . not too many profession out there that value forgetfulness . prostitution , maybe . Politics , of course . no . you life be over . you be a dead man . the only thing the doctor be hope to do be teach you to be less of a burden to the orderly . and they will probably never let you go home , wherever that would be . so the question be not " to be or not to be , " because you be not . the question be whether you want to do something about it . whether revenge matter to you . it do to most people . for a few week , they plot , they scheme , they take measure to get even . but the passage of time be all it take to erode that initial impulse . time be theft , be not that what they say ? and time eventually convince most of we that forgiveness be a virtue . conveniently , cowardice and forgiveness look identical at a certain distance . time steal you nerve . if time and fear be not enough to dissuade people from they revenge , then there 's always authority , softly shaking its head and say , we understand , but you be the better man for let it go . for rise above it . for not sink to they level . and besides , say authority , if you try anything stupid , we will lock you up in a little room . but they already put you in a little room , do not they ? only they do not really lock it or even guard it too carefully because you be a cripple . a corpse . a vegetable who probably would not remember to eat or take a shit if someone be not there to remind you . and as for the passage of time , well , that do not really apply to you anymore , do it ? just the same ten minute , over and over again . so how can you forgive if you can not remember to forget ? you probably be the type to let it go , be not you ? before . but you be not the man you use to be . not even half . you be a fraction ; you be the ten-minute man . of course , weakness be strong . it 's the primary impulse . you would probably prefer to sit in you little room and cry . live in you finite collection of memory , carefully polish each one . half a life set behind glass and pin to cardboard like a collection of exotic insect . you would like to live behind that glass , would not you ? preserved in aspic . you would like to but you can not , can you ? you can not because of the last addition to you collection . the last thing you remember . his face . his face and you wife , look to you for help . and maybe this be where you can retire to when it 's over . you little collection . they can lock you back up in another little room and you can live the rest of you life in the past . but only if you have get a little piece of paper in you hand that say you get he . you know I be right . you know there 's a lot of work to do . it may seem impossible , but I be sure if we all do we part , we will figure something out . but you do not have much time . you have only get about ten minute , in fact . then it start all over again . so do something with the time you have get . *** earl open he eye and blink into the darkness . the alarm clock be ringing . it say 3:20 , and the moonlight stream through the window mean it must be he early morning . Earl fumble for the lamp , almost knock it over in the process . incandescent light fill the room , painting the metal furniture yellow , the wall yellow , the bedspread , too . he lie back and look up at the stretch of yellow ceiling tile above he , interrupt by a handwritten sign tape to the ceiling . he read the sign two , maybe three time , then blink at the room around he . it be a bare room . institutional , maybe . there be a desk over by the window . the desk be bare except for the blaring alarm clock . Earl probably notice , at this point , that he be fully clothed . he even have he shoe on under the sheet . he extract himself from the bed and cross to the desk . nothing in the room would suggest that anyone live there , or ever have , except for the odd scrap of tape stick here and there to the wall . no picture , no book , nothing . through the window , he can see a full moon shine on carefully manicure grass . Earl slap the snooze button on the alarm clock and stare a moment at the two key tape to the back of he hand . he pick at the tape while he search through the empty drawer . in the leave pocket of he jacket , he find a roll of hundred - dollar bill and a letter seal in a envelope . he check the rest of the main room and the bathroom . bit of tape , cigarette butt . nothing else . Earl absentmindedly play with the lump of scar tissue on he neck and move back toward the bed . he lie back down and stare up at the ceiling and the sign tape to it . the sign read , get up , get out right now . these people be try to kill you . Earl close he eye . *** they try to teach you to make list in grade school , remember ? back when you day planner be the back of you hand . and if you assignment come off in the shower , well , then they do not get do . no direction , they say . no discipline . so they try to get you to write it all down somewhere more permanent . of course , you grade - school teacher would be laugh they pants wet if they could see you now . because you have become the exact product of they organizational lesson . because you can not even take a piss without consulting one of you list . they be right . list be the only way out of this mess . here 's the truth : people , even regular people , be never just any one person with one set of attribute . it 's not that simple . we be all at the mercy of the limbic system , cloud of electricity drift through the brain . every man be break into twenty - four-hour fraction , and then again within that twenty - four hour . it 's a daily pantomime , one man yield control to the next : a backstage crowded with old hack clamoring for they turn in the spotlight . every week , every day . the angry man hand the baton over to the sulk man , and in turn to the sex addict , the introvert , the conversationalist . every man be a mob , a chain gang of idiot . this be the tragedy of life . because for a few minute of every day , every man become a genius . moment of clarity , insight , whatever you want to call they . the cloud part , the planet get in a neat little line , and everything become obvious . I should quit smoking , maybe , or here 's how I could make a fast million , or such and such be the key to eternal happiness . that 's the miserable truth . for a few moment , the secret of the universe be open to we . life be a cheap parlor trick . but then the genius , the savant , have to hand over the control to the next guy down the pike , most likely the guy who just want to eat potato chip , and insight and brilliance and salvation be all entrust to a moron or a hedonist or a narcoleptic . the only way out of this mess , of course , be to take step to ensure that you control the idiot that you become . to take you chain gang , hand in hand , and lead they . the best way to do this be with a list . it 's like a letter you write to yourself . a master plan , draft by the guy who can see the light , make with step simple enough for the rest of the idiot to understand . follow step one through one hundred . repeat as necessary . you problem be a little more acute , maybe , but fundamentally the same thing . it 's like that computer thing , the chinese room . you remember that ? one guy sit in a little room , lay down card with letter write on they in a language he do not understand , lay they down one letter at a time in a sequence accord to someone else 's instruction . the card be suppose to spell out a joke in chinese . the guy do not speak chinese , of course . he just follow he instruction . there be some obvious difference in you situation , of course : you break out of the room they have you in , so the whole enterprise have to be portable . and the guy give the instruction - that 's you , too , just a earlier version of you . and the joke you be tell , well , it 's get a punch line . I just do not think anyone 's go to find it very funny . so that 's the idea . all you have to do be follow you instruction . like climb a ladder or descend a staircase . one step at a time . right down the list . simple . and the secret , of course , to any list be to keep it in a place where you be bound to see it . *** he can hear the buz through he eyelid . insistent . he reach out for the alarm clock , but he can not move he arm . Earl open he eye to see a large man bent double over he . the man look up at he , annoyed , then resume he work . Earl look around he . too dark for a doctor 's office . then the pain flood he brain , block out the other question . he squirm gain , try to yank he forearm away , the one that feel like it 's burn . the arm do not move , but the man shoot he another scowl . Earl adjust himself in the chair to see over the top of the man 's head . the noise and the pain be both come from a gun in the man 's hand - a gun with a needle where the barrel should be . the needle be digging into the fleshy underside of Earl 's forearm , leave a trail of puffy letter behind it . Earl try to rearrange himself to get a better view , to read the letter on he arm , but he can not . he lie back and stare at the ceiling . eventually the tattoo artist turn off the noise , wipe Earl 's forearm with a piece of gauze , and wander over to the back to dig up a pamphlet describe how to deal with a possible infection . maybe later he will tell he wife about this guy and he little note . maybe he wife will convince he to call the police . Earl look down at the arm . the letter be rise up from the skin , weep a little . they run from just behind the strap of Earl 's watch all the way to the inside of he elbow . Earl blink at the message and read it again . it say , in careful little capital , I rape and kill you wife . *** it 's you birthday today , so I get you a little present . I would have just buy you a beer , but who know where that would have end ? so instead , I get you a bell . I think I may have have to pawn you watch to buy it , but what the hell do you need a watch for , anyway ? you be probably ask yourself , why a bell ? in fact , I be guess you be go to be ask yourself that question every time you find it in you pocket . too many of this letter now . too many for you to dig back into every time you want to know the answer to some little question . it 's a joke , actually . a practical joke . but think of it this way : I be not really laugh at you so much as with you . I would like to think that every time you take it out of you pocket and wonder , why do I have this bell ? a little part of you , a little piece of you break brain , will remember and laugh , like I be laugh now . besides , you do know the answer . it be something you learn before . so if you think about it , you will know . back in the old day , people be obsessed with the fear of be bury alive . you remember now ? Medical science not be quite what it be today , it be not uncommon for people to suddenly wake up in a casket . so rich folk have they coffin outfit with breathe tube . Little tube run up to the mud above so that if someone wake up when they be not suppose to , they would not run out of oxygen . now , they must have test this out and realize that you could shout yourself hoarse through the tube , but it be too narrow to carry much noise . not enough to attract attention , at least . so a string be run up the tube to a little bell attach to the headstone . if a dead person come back to life , all he have to do be ring he little bell till someone come and dig he up again . I be laugh now , picture you on a bus or maybe in a fast - food restaurant , reach into you pocket and find you little bell and wonder to yourself where it come from , why you have it . maybe you will even ring it . happy birthday , buddy . I do not know who figure out the solution to we mutual problem , so I do not know whether to congratulate you or I . a bit of a lifestyle change , admittedly , but a elegant solution , nonetheless . look to yourself for the answer . that sound like something out of a hallmark card . I do not know when you think it up , but my hat 's off to you . not that you know what the hell I be talk about . but , honestly , a real brainstorm . after all , everybody else need mirror to remind themselves who they be . you be no different . *** the little mechanical voice pause , then repeat itself . it say , " the time be 8:00 a.m . this be a courtesy call . " Earl open he eye and replace the receiver . the phone be perch on a cheap veneer headboard that stretch behind the bed , curve to meet the corner , and end at the minibar . the tv be still on , blob of flesh color natter away at each other . Earl lie back down and be surprised to see himself , older now , tan , the hair pull away from he head like solar flare . the mirror on the ceiling be crack , the silver fade increase . Earl continue to stare at himself , astonished by what he see . he be fully dress , but the clothes be old , threadbare in place . Earl feel the familiar spot on he leave wrist for he watch , but it 's go . he look down from the mirror to he arm . it be bare and the skin have change to a even tan , as if he never own a watch in the first place . the skin be even in color except for the solid black arrow on the inside of Earl 's wrist , point up he shirtsleeve . he stare at the arrow for a moment . perhaps he do not try to rub it off anymore . he roll up he sleeve . the arrow point to a sentence tattooe along Earl 's inner arm . Earl read the sentence once , maybe twice . another arrow pick up at the beginning of the sentence , point farther up Earl 's arm , disappear under the roll - up shirtsleeve . he unbutton he shirt . look down on he chest , he can make out the shape but cannot bring they into focus , so he look up at the mirror above he . the arrow lead up Earl 's arm , cross at the shoulder , and descend onto he upper torso , terminate at a picture of a man 's face that occupy most of he chest . the face be that of a large man , bald , with a mustache and a goatee . it be a particular face , but like a police sketch it have a certain unreal quality . the rest of he upper torso be cover in word , phrase , bit of information , and instruction , all of they write backward on Earl , forward in the mirror . eventually Earl sit up , button he shirt , and cross to the desk . he take out a pen and a piece of notepaper from the desk drawer , sit , and begin to write . *** I do not know where you will be when you read this . I be not even sure if you will bother to read this . I guess you do not need to . it 's a shame , really , that you and I will never meet . but , like the song say , " by the time you read this note , I will be go .

I guess it 's better that you can not . I have a think just now . maybe you will find it useful . everybody be wait for the end to come , but what if it already pass we by ? what if the final joke of judgment Day be that it have already come and go and we be none the wiser ? apocalypse arrive quietly ; the choose be herde off to heaven , and the rest of we , the one who fail the test , just keep on go , oblivious . Dead already , wander around long after the god have stop keep score , still optimistic about the future . I guess if that 's true , then it do not matter what you do . no expectation . if you can not find he , then it do not matter , because nothing matter . and if you do find he , then you can kill he without worry about the consequence . because there be no consequence . that 's what I be think about right now , in this scrappy little room . frame picture of ship on the wall .

I will put down the pen , close my eye , and then you can read this through if you want . I just want you to know that I be proud of you . no one who matter be leave to say it . no one leave be go to want to . earl' eye be wide OPEN , stare through the window of the car . smiling eye . smiling through the window at the crowd gather across the street . the crowd gather around the body in the doorway . the body empty slowly across the sidewalk and into the storm drain . *** a stocky guy , facedown , eye open . bald head , goatee . in death , as in police sketches , face tend to look the same . this be definitely somebody in particular . but really , it could be anybody . Earl be still smile at the body as the car pull away from the curb . the car ? who 's to say ? maybe it 's a police cruiser . maybe it 's just a taxi . as the car be swallow into traffic , Earl 's eye continue to shine out into the night , watch the body until it disappear into a circle of concerned pedestrian . he chuckle to himself as the car continue to make distance between he and the grow crowd . Earl 's smile fade a little . something have occur to he . he begin to pat down he pocket ; leisurely at first , like a man look for he key , then a little more desperately . maybe he progress be impede by a set of handcuffs . he begin to empty the content of he pocket out onto the seat next to he . some money . a bunch of key . scrap of paper . a round metal lump roll out of he pocket and slide across the vinyl seat . Earl be frantic now . he hammer at the plastic divider between he and the driver , begging the man for a pen . perhaps the cabbie do not speak much English . perhaps the cop be not in the habit of talk to suspect . either way , the divider between the man in front and the man behind remain close . a pen be not forthcoming . the car hit a pothole , and Earl blink at he reflection in the rearview mirror . he be calm now . the driver make another corner , and the metal lump slide back over to rest against Earl 's leg with a little jingle . he pick it up and look at it , curious now . it be a little bell . a little metal bell . inscribe on it be he name and a set of date . he recognize the first one : the year in which he be bear . but the second date mean nothing to he . nothing at all . as he turn the bell over in he hand , he notice the empty space on he wrist where he watch use to sit . there be a little arrow there , point up he arm . Earl look at the arrow , then begin to roll up he sleeve . *** " you would be late for you own funeral , " she would say . remember ? the more I think about it , the more trite that seem . what kind of idiot , after all , be in any kind of rush to get to the end of he own story ? and how would I know if I be late , anyway ? I do not have a watch anymore . I do not know what we do with it . what the hell do you need a watch for , anyway ? it be a antique . deadweight tug at you wrist . symbol of the old you . the you that believe in time . no. scratch that . it 's not so much that you have lose you faith in time as that time have lose its faith in you . and who need it , anyway ? who want to be one of that sap live in the safety of the future , in the safety of the moment after the moment in which they feel something powerful ? live in the next moment , in which they feel nothing . crawl down the hand of the clock , away from the people who do unspeakable thing to they . believe the lie that time will heal all wound - which be just a nice way of say that time deaden we . but you be different . you be more perfect . time be three thing for most people , but for you , for we , just one . a singularity . one moment . this moment . like you be the center of the clock , the axis on which the hand turn . time move about you but never move you . it have lose its ability to affect you . what be it they say ? that time be theft ? but not for you . Close you eye and you can start all over again . conjure up that necessary emotion , fresh as rose . time be a absurdity . a abstraction . the only thing that matter be this moment . this moment a million time over . you have to trust I . if this moment be repeat enough , if you keep try - and you have to keep try - eventually you will come across the next item on you list . end . < / colour ></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour></colour >
