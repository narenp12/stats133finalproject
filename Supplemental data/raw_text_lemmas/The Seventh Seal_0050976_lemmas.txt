( sing ) one moment you be bright and lively , the next you be crawl with worm . fate be a terrible villain and you , my friend , its poor victim . knight must you sing ? jon no . the knight hand he squire a piece of bread , which keep he quiet for a while . the sun burn down on they cruelly , and bead of perspiration trickle down they face . there be a cloud of dust around the horse ' hoof . they ride past a inlet and along verdant grove . in the shade of some large tree stand a bulg wagon cover with a mottle canvas . a horse whinny nearby and be answer by the knight be horse . the two traveler do not stop to rest under the shade of the tree but continue riding until they disappear at the bend of the road . in he sleep , jof the juggler hear the neigh of he horse and the answer from a distance . he try to go on sleep , but it be stifling inside the wagon . the ray of the sun filter through the canvas cast streak of light across the face of jof' wife , mia , and they one - year - old son , mikael , who be sleep deeply and peacefully . near they , jonas skat , a older man , snore loudly . jof crawl out of the wagon . there be still a spot of shade under the big tree . he take a drink of water , gargle , stretch and talk to he scrawny old horse . jof good morning . have you have breakfast ?

I see myself in it , and I be fill with fear and disgust . death do not answer . knight through my indifference to my fellow man , I have isolate myself from they company . now I live in a world of phantom . I be imprison in my dream and fantasy . death and yet you do not want to die . knight yes , I do . death what be you wait for ? knight I want knowledge . death you want guarantee ? knight call it whatever you like . be it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the sense ? why should he hide himself in a mist of half - speak promise and unseen miracle ? death do not answer . knight how can we have faith in that who believe when we can not have faith in ourselves ? what be go to happen to that of we who want to believe but be not able to ? and what be to become of that who neither want to nor be capable of believe ? the knight stop and wait for a reply , but no one speak or answer he . there be complete silence . knight why can not I kill God within I ? why do he live on in this painful and humiliate way even though I curse him and want to tear him out of my heart ? why , in spite of everything , be he a baffling reality that I can not shake off ? do you hear I ? death yes , I hear you . knight I want knowledge , not faith , not supposition , but knowledge . I want God to stretch out his hand towards I , reveal himself and speak to I . death but he remain silent . knight I call out to him in the dark but no one seem to be there . death perhaps no one be there . knight then life be a outrageous horror . no one can live in the face of death , know that all be nothingness . death most people never reflect about either death or the futility of life . knight but one day they will have to stand at that last moment of life and look towards the darkness . death when that day come ... knight in we fear , we make a image , and that image we call God . death you be worry ... knight death visit I this morning . we be play chess together . this reprieve give I the chance to arrange a urgent matter . death what matter be that ? knight my life have be a futile pursuit , a wander , a great deal of talk without meaning . I feel no bitterness or self - reproach because the life of most people be very much like this . but I will use my reprieve for one meaningful deed . death be that why you be play chess with death ? knight he be a clever opponent , but up to now I have not lose a single man . death how will you outwit death in you game ? knight I use a combination of the bishop and the knight which he have not yet discover . in the next move I will shatter one of he flank . death I will remember that . death show he face at the grill of the confession booth for a moment but disappear instantly . knight you have trick and cheat I ! but we will meet again , and I will find a way . death ( invisible ) we will meet at the inn , and there we will continue play . the knight raise he hand and look at it in the sunlight which come through the tiny window . knight this be my hand . I can move it , feel the blood pulsing through it . the sun be still high in the sky and I , antonius block , be play chess with death . he make a fist of he hand and lift it to he temple . meanwhile , jon and the painter have get drunk and be talk animatedly together . jon I and my master have be abroad and have just come home . do you understand , you little pictor ? painter the crusade . jon ( drunk ) precisely . for ten year we sit in the Holy land and let snake bite we , fly sting we , wild animal eat we , heathen butcher we , the wine poison we , the woman give we lice , the lice devour we , the fever rot we , all for the glory of God . we crusade be such madness that only a real idealist could have think it up . but what you say about the plague be horrible . painter it 's worse than that . jon ah , I . no matter which way you turn , you have you rump behind you . that 's the truth . painter the rump behind you , the rump behind you there 's a profound truth . jon paint a small figure which be suppose to represent himself . jon this be squire jun . he grin at death , mock the Lord , laugh at himself and leer at the girl . his world be a jÂˆnsworld , believable only to himself , ridiculous to all include himself , meaningless to Heaven and of no interest to Hell . the knight walk by , call to he squire and go out into the bright sunshine . jon manage to set himself down from the scaffold . outside the church , four soldier and a monk be in the process of put a woman in the stock . her face be pale and child - like , she head have be shave , and she knuckle be bloody and break . her eye be wide open , yet she do not appear to be fully conscious . jon and the knight stop and watch in silence . the soldier be work quickly and skillfully , but they seem frighten and deject . the monk mumble from a small book . one of the soldier pick up a wooden bucket and with he hand begin to smear a bloody paste on the wall of the church and around the woman . jon hold he nose . jon that soup of yours have a hell of a stink . what be it good for ? soldier she have have carnal intercourse with the evil one . he whisper this with a horrify face and continue to splash the sticky mess on the wall . jon and now she 's in the stock . soldier she will be burn tomorrow morning at the parish boundary . but we have to keep the Devil away from the rest of we . jon ( hold he nose ) and you do that with this stinking mess ? soldier it 's the best remedy : blood mix with the bile of a big black dog . the Devil can not stand the smell . jon neither can i. jon walk over towards the horse . the knight stand for a few , moment look at the young girl . she be almost a child . slowly she turn she eye towards he . knight have you see the Devil ? the monk stop read and raise he head . monk you must not talk to she . knight can that be so dangerous ? monk I do not know , but she be believe to have cause the pestilence with which we be affect . knight I understand . he nod resignedly and walk away . the young woman start to moan as though she be have a horrible nightmare . the sound of she cry follow the two rider for a considerable distance down the road . the sun stand high in the sky , like a red ball of fire . the waterskin be empty and jon look for a well where he can fill it . they approach a group of peasant cottage at the edge of the forest . jon tie up the horse , sling the skin over he shoulder and walk along the path towards the nearest cottage . as always , he movement be light and almost soundless . the door to the cottage be open . he stop outside , but when no one appear he enter . it be very dark inside and he foot touch a soft object . he look down . beside the whitewash fireplace , a woman be lie with she face to the ground . at the sound of approach step , jon quickly hide behind the door . a man come down a ladder from the loft . he be broad and thick - set . his eye be black and he face be pale and puffy . his clothes be well cut but dirty and in rag . he carry a cloth sack . look around , he go into the inner room , bend over the bed , tuck something into the bag , slink along the wall , look on the shelf , find something else which he tuck in he bag . slowly he re-enter the outer room , bend over the dead woman and carefully slip a ring from she finger . at that moment a young woman come through the door . she stop and stare at the stranger . ravel why do you look so surprised ?
