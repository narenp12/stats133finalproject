Alice move through the room like someone who do not know where she be . she stop in front of a mirror . wipe the condensation from it . stare at she own naked body as if it belong to a stranger . she see a fresh bruise on one shoulder . from fall in the shower ? but she other shoulder be even more intrigue . a old scar trace a long jag line from the top of she arm to she elbow . look like a knife do it . a big one . Alice touch the scar . like it be all strange to she . like she 's never see it before , int . mansion - bedroom Alice see a red dress laid on the bed for she . a pair of boot stand close by . do she lay this out ? she just do not remember . CUT to : int . mansion - bedroom - later Alice , now dress , stand over a antique write desk . lying on it be a handwritten note . she pick it up : '' today all you dream come true " , Alice walk to the window . so far everything be a exact replay of resident evil 1 , until -- ( continued ) continued : Alice part the curtain , but instead of a view of the wood , there be nothing but concrete outside the window . a solid , impenetrable concrete wall . off Alice 's puzzle look we -- CUT to : int . mansion â€” hallway Alice wander the mansion . close on a frame photograph as Alice take it from a side table . it 's of she and a handsome man . he have he arm around she . he wear a wedding ring . Alice look at she own hand . she too wear a simple gold band . be this man she husband ? she stare at the picture again . try to remember . int . mansion - entrance chamber Alice approach the front door of the mansion . everything be exactly as it be in the first film , until -- Alice open the door . but instead of a ornamental garden , she step out into -- int . the hive - glass corridor a long corridor make entirely of glass . the wall , the floor , the ceiling . this be where one ( the leader of the commando team ) and the other commando meet they bloody end in resident evil 1 . but Alice do not know this . she do not remember anything . but she know that something be wrong . the light dim . something be happen . Alice turn to return to the mansion , but the door have already swing close . there be no go back . suddenly a horizontal beam of laser light travel down the corridor at high speed . it start at ankle level and then rise to chest height . there be no escape it . and it 's head straight for Alice . at the last moment , Alice leap into the air - and stay there ! she be hang from a air vent in the ceiling , she leg pull up above the level of the laser . the beam have pass right beneath she , only just miss . ( continued ) continued : this be a exact repeat from resident evil 1 , except instead of one 's knife be catch by the laser beam , a thin sliver of Alice 's red dress drift to the floor , slice off by the deadly laser . Alice drop back to the floor as the light begin to dim again . and because history be repeat itself , we know what will happen next . Alice will die , just as one do . a second laser beam fire towards Alice . she jump in the air again . the thin laser wire switch to a grid . fifty interlock laser line form a deadly net from which there be no escape . but Alice swing she body upwards , kick the air vent aside , and disappear into the air duct above the corridor . at the last moment she pull she head into the air duct and escape the laser grid . it be a close call , as witness by the strand of blonde hair that drift slowly to the floor of the glass corridor . the end be singe ~- burnt by the laser beam . int . AIR duct tight , claustrophobic and pitch black in here . barely room to move . but Alice crawl forward . push ever onwards . eventually she see a faint light filter in from above . a access hatch of some kind in the roof of the duct . Alice push it cautiously open , to reveal -- int . raccoon CITY hospital - corridor night . Alice climb from the access hatch and stare at the desert corridor -- it be the same one she wander at the end of resident evil 1 . the very same one the nemesis prowled in resident evil : apocalypse . Alice look around , try to remember , try to figure this out . at the end of the corridor be a set of glass door lead to the city street . it 's silent out there . Alice take a few step forward and then halt . sense something . the corridor be empty , but still Alice feel uneasy . a gurney rest against the wall beside she . Alice take it and push it down the corridor ahead of she . ( continued ) continued : the gurney triggers a concealed trap . a viciously sharp wire slice across the corridor , cut the metal gurney clean in half . it would have do the same to Alice .
