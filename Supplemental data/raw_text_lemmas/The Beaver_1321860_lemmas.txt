I be sorry about what happen . I do not know how many more way I can say that , but I be not you problem , norah . you problem be that you have no idea who you really be , and you do not seem the least bit interested in find out . you can take all he class , and give he speech , and go get he degree if you want , but sooner or later you and you parent be gonna have to face the act that none of that be go to bring you brother back . she stop suddenl turn and slap he . hard . drop she tray and put he on t Ã© ground , hard . the whole room look up . people stand , crowd in . some ohhs . they be all wait . she look down at he . she 's teary eye , but she voice be pure anger . norah you want to hear from the real I ? fuck off . she walk away and be immediately embrace by the squad . porter just sit there until people lose interest , move on . he snap the rubber band on he wrist . 83. int . today show studio angle on the vp stand by a monitor watch the back and forth between matt lauer and the beaver . the vp look like he 's nervous enough to gnaw off a finger . new angle matt lauer and so what be they reaction the first time you show up for work like this ? the beaver well , I be sure they think I be crazy . and justifiably so . show Matt and walter on the actual set . the beaver ( cont 'd ) would not you ? matt lauer but that 's not how you see yourself ? the beaver not at all . mozart be say to occasionally feel oblige to meow like a cat , but he seem to get on all right . walter 's approach be unconventional because conventional approach prove worthless . what 's important be not how someone look or speak , but what result from they action and word . I think the overwhelming success of what be recently a fail company say all it need to about walter 's judgement . matt lauer and this all begin as a way of deal with depression ? the beaver sometimes , Matt , we reach a point where in order to go on , we have to wipe the slate clean . put the problem , failure , and fear of the past behind we and begin again from scratch . matt lauer well , I think the obvious question be , why would you choose this particular way to attack that problem ? 84 . the beaver because sometimes the thing that 's hold you back be the very idea of who you be . we begin we life believe that anything be possible and then slowly we let the wall close in until all we can see be this very narrow range of possibility . we say thing like â€˜oh I be not the kind of person who could do this or that , who could look this way or that way , who could say this thing or that . 's we start to see who we be as a box that we be trap inside , and however we try to escape ; resolution , therapy , drug , class , it simply reel we back in . and I believe the only way to truly break out be to get rid of that box all together . if think and act and be a certain way , a certain ' person 's , have result in unhappiness , why would you keep do it ? take you future into you hand and start over be not crazy . crazy be be miserable and still do yehe same thing day after day . walter have make a mess of he life , and until he freed himself from he failure , he be cut off from the potential for the wonderful thing you see happen to he now . I have suggest to you that there be many '' other out there be crushe under the weight of the box they have put themselves in . and whether that best ple pick up a puppet or not be eside the point . what 's important be that they find a way to start over from a point where they really and truly believe that anything be possible . because it 's be my experience that if you can do yehat , what follow will only confirm the notion . Matt think on this for a moment . he seem surprised , new angle show the vp watch , stunne . matt lauer ( on monitor ) well , I want thank you for join we this morning . the vp can not believe they have pull it off . he look elate . begin montage : 85 . int . today show studio - moment later walter stand and shake hand with Matt lauer . the beaver ( v.o. ) this be a picture of walter Black . a hopelessly depressed individual .
