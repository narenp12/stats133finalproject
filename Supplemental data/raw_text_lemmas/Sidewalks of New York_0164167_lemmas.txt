I do not agree with she . I see in motherhood only that which be beautiful and god-like . I ached to write a answer to she nature - flaunt " expos@ . " then out of the air come the question : why not write a photoplay flay the evil of birth control and glorify motherhood ? " a dozen plot present themselves . I write a number of they , then start all over again . my first effort sound too much like a sermon ; my second like a physician 's treatise . I realize that , first of all , the story must entertain . the photoplay fan pay they quarter to be entertained , not to be preach to . so I sugar-coate the pill by make the propaganda subservient to the dramatic action . ' after another effort I succeed in complete a single - track theme about a woman , a pampere daughter of the upper ten , who , through prejudice and fear , balk at maternity . then for dramatic contrast , I rewrote the story , employ another woman , who welcome motherhood . this do , I decide to give the fan a '' run for they money " by inject a fight , a head - on train wreck collision , and a fashionable party bear the more or less intrigue designation of " pagan revel . " ' later in the book , the author helpfully include the first page or so of he script . the open title read : '' we message be not for the mother of the world -- they have already do they splendid share -- but for that marry woman who , through fear , ignorance , vanity and prejudice , wilfully violate his Supreme Command .
