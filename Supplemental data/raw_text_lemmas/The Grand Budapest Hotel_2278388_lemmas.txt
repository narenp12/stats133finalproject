I can not tell you how many time . somebody come up to I ( back on track ) to he who have often tell the tale of other , many tale will be tell . the boy return , the gun now tuck under he belt , and sit , immediately comfortable , on the author 's lap with the old man 's arm wrap around he shoulder . the conflict seem never to have exist . they both look into the camera as the author conclude : author the incident that follow be describe to I exactly as I present they here , and in a wholly unexpected way . ext . mountain range . day the late sixty . a stun view from a rusty , iron - lattice terrace suspend over a deep crevasse , green and lush , alongside a high cascade . the author continue in voice - over as the camera glide along a crack path through a plot of untamed edelweiss and buttercup : author ( v.0 . ) a number of year ago , while suffer from a mild case of '' scribe 's fever '' ( a form of neurasthenia common among the intelligentsia of that time ) I have decide to spend the month of August in the spa town of nebelsbad below the Alpine sudetenwaltz -- and have take up room in the Grand budapest -- the camera come to a stop as it reveal a sprawling nineteenth - century hotel and bath situate on a wide plateau . there be a deep , formidable staircase up to a regal entrance . there be a promenade above and a glass - panell conservatory below . a rickety funicular groan as it slowly climb its hillside track . the grass need cut , the roof need patching , and more or less every surface of the building need a coat of paint . author ( v.0 . ) a picturesque , elaborate , and once widely - celebrate establishment . I expect some of you will know it . it be off - season and , by that time , decidedly out - of -fashion ; and it have already begin its descent into shabbiness and eventual demolition . montage : the nine other guest of the hotel each observe from a respectful distance : a frail student ; a fat businessman ; a burly hiker with a St. Bernard ; a schoolteacher with she hair in a bun ; a doctor ; a lawyer ; a actor ; and so on . author ( v.o . ) what few guest we be have quickly come to recognize one another by sight as the only live soul reside in the vast establishment -- although I do not believe any acquaintance among we number have proceed beyond the polite nod we exchange as we pass in the Palm Court and the Arabian bath and onboard the colonnade funicular . we be a very reserve group , it seem -- and , without exception , solitary .

Jean . ( note : the staff of the hotel in both the relevant time - period wear similar version of the same purple uniform =- while the public space reflect a cycle of '' regime change '' . ) on the wall behind M. Jean , there be a beautiful , flemish painting of a pale , young boy hold a piece of golden fruit . this be '' Boy with Apple '' . a patch of water - damage above seep dangerously close to the picture - frame . the author ( a fictionalized version of himself ) wander into the room with he hand in he pocket . he have dark circle under he eye . author ( v.0 . ) perhaps as a result of this general silence , I have establish a casual and banter familiarity with the hotel 's concierge , a west-continental know only as M. Jean , who strike one as be , at once , both lazy and , really , quite accommodate . M.
