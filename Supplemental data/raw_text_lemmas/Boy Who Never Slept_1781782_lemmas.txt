I mean , I have love girl , but I have not be blow away by they . sarah um ... thanks . daniel I do not mean it like that . sarah yes you do . but that 's okay . you can care about someone , even love they , and not be ' in ' love with they or ' blow away . ' daniel I could be in love with Melissa like that , but I would have to see she in person to really know . ah fuck it ... I will just stick to work a lot , and go out by myself . sarah right . anyway , it would be hard to know what you feeling really be without spend time in the flesh . daniel ( teasingly ) it 's all about the flesh sarah mmmm . apparently it 's not , because as you say , you have no problem with that area . daniel I be kid . sex be easy , but sex with passion and meaning ... yeah ... that 's the good stuff . anyway ... at least part of you still have to find some strange , unexplainable attraction to the directionless writer still search for that special think . sarah maybe , but only a little part . daniel ( awkward silence ) I know . so how be you and you husband do ? sarah we be fine . daniel you look really happy together . sarah thanks , we be . stop try to change the subject . why have not you meet Melissa yet ? daniel she say she 's not ready to meet I yet and that she feel pressured . sarah that 's odd ... do not you guy talk all the time ? daniel yeah , but remember she 's only si- , ah , 19 , and I kinda call she drunk awhile ago and say some thing . sarah what thing ? daniel it 's embarrassing . I ask she to marry I , tell she I love she , and , well , you know ... sarah no wonder she do not want to meet you right away . daniel maybe I should stop talk to she , tell she I do not want to do the wrong thing and mess she life up . sarah right . then you will start drink and call she and all this shit will come out and you will not even remember what you say to she . daniel I do not do that anymore . sarah yeah . famous last word , Daniel . daniel I promise I would stop ... sarah Promised who ? you even use to call I drunk . daniel what ?! sarah you use call I and beg I to live with you , kiss you ... , all that stuff . daniel ( embarrassed ) ahhh , you never tell I all that before . I be sorry about that ... sarah if I have a boyfriend who be do that . you have a habit of do this and not just in isolate incident . daniel so what would you recommend ? sarah no more whacked out phone call , obviously . and honestly , I would want to meet she in person , to try and see if you feeling be real and if she feel the same . you will gain a much clearer and accurate idea of the situation and the type of relationship that may exist between the two of you , in the real world , not virtual land . now , there be a huge risk in that , because what if they be real and she still do not feel the same for you ? it will hurt like a bitch , but at least you will know , and you can stop put yourself out there . even though that 's a worst case scenario , there be a positive side to it , because you will definitely get closure either way . daniel well she do not want to meet I yet . she 's all fuck up . sarah I think she do ; she 's just nervous . just explain it to she the way I have explain it to you . if she really care about you as a true friend , and not some trophy who be infatuated with she , then she will want to do whatever she can to help salvage the friendship while still respect you honest feeling for she . daniel okay , I guess I will do what I originally want and take she out . sarah okay , let 's get you terminology right first . you will not be " take she out " you will be " meeting " she . it 's the difference between sounding sleazy and sounding decent . that be the little thing that freak girl out . daniel all right , we will see what happen . thank you , though , I appreciate you you advice on this .
