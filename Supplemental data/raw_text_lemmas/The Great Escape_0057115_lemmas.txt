" to my mind this be also the story of a Tower of babel . the fact that this tower be in reverse and happen to be a tunnel be a minor point . what be important then - and be more so now - be that this Tower of babel be successfully erect . it prove something important . in one magnificent gesture the seventy - six rag , verminous man of all nationality who climb out of that stinking hole in the ground in silesia on that windy March night in 1944 thumbed they collective nose at the entire third Reich an√© all it stand for . " they triumph , through the only mean leave to . they , over a idea that be rotten from the core out . and. they prove for all posterity that man , work together , can dig a damned deep hole in the ground - or build a shine Tower of babel .
