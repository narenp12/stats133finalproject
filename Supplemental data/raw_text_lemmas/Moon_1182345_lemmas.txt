moon written by Nathan parker Story by Duncan Jones November , 2007 helium3 be a gas eject from the surface of the sun and blow through space by solar wind . it play a essential role in cold Fusion , often tote as the solution to humanity 's future energy need . there be one major problem ... helium3 be extremely scarce on Earth . the gas do , however , exist in abundance on the Earth 's only natural satellite : the Moon . should we turn to cold Fusion in the future , it be conceivable that man will mine the Moon for helium3 and bring the precious gas back to Earth ... 2 . in the black : we hear something -- a machine -- churning and pounding . constant . rhythmic . though the sound be slightly familiar , we be not sure what it be yet . hold for a few second and then CUT to : 1 int . rec room -- morning 1 the sound belong to a regular old treadmill like you see in most gym across the world . running on it : SAM bell , mid thirty , thick beard , handsome , strike blue eye . Sam 's face be flushed and glisten with sweat . he lunge for a towel drape over the treadmill 's bar , dab he face as he run . we see outside the window : a gray , powdery landscape stretch beneath a black sky . CUT to : 2 ext . moon -- morning 2 aerial view of the Earth 's only natural satellite , the camera roam about a hundred foot off the surface . desolation . serious , uncompromising , desolation . this place make Antarctica look like Tokyo . and utter silence . eventually the camera arrive at a moon base , diving down towards it -- title card : " mining base selene . crew : 1 . " CUT to : 3 int . bathroom \shower -- morning 3 Sam take a shower , tread in a tight circle beneath the nozzle , eye close , hot water blast he face . 3. 4 int . comm room 4 his hair still wet from the shower , Sam sit before a comm unit , dress in a " lunar industry " boiler suit , a zip up the front , colorful patch sewn into the arm . he begin to record a message . SAM tess . hi. it 's I . how be you , sweetheart ? it 's the morning here . in a few minute gerty and I will sit down for breakfast , go over the day 's itinerary . as Sam continue he message , we be give a tour of the mining base . beginning with : 5 int . monitoring station 5 this be where you want to be if the shit hit the fan . the base 's equivalent of hq . a wall of computer and flicker digital display . SAM ( v.o. ) today begin my 154th week on selene . I officially have two week to go before I climb into that return vehicle ... 6 int . return vehicle 6 a small space craft attach to the base . it be essentially a tiny room with a coffin like , seal bed in the middle of it : a cryogenic pod with a array of complicated control surround it . SAM ( v.o. ) and blast home . 7 int . rec room 7 Sam spend most of he time here . it be kitchen and play room combine . we pick out a television set , a armchair , a ping - pong table , the treadmill . SAM ( v.o. ) I never dream I would make it this far . 4. detail : a wooden model on a table , we also pick out a large model carve out of bolser wood . it 's a town . intricately do down to the tiniest detail . SAM ( v.o. ) ( cont 'd ) there be time , as you know ... we go even closer to the model , see that there be actual people , actual character in the little town ; actual building : a church , a town hall , etc . clearly someone have put a ton of work into this thing . SAM ( v.o. ) ( cont 'd ) ... when I think I be go to crack up . 8 int . greenhouse 8 and the tour of the base continue . onto a new room . a dark storage area Sam have repurpose to grow a handful of plant . they sit surround by darkness , glow under pool of artificial light . SAM ( v.o. ) but I think I have come out the other side now . 9 int . infirmary 9 a strange angular room , obviously purposeful , but its design more gear to a computer than a human be . a single bed dominate . SAM ( v.o. ) in many way , this place be all about contradiction . 10 ext . lunar landscape 10 the empty terrain surround the mining base , as view from the monitor Station window . across the landscape a mountain rise from the morning shadow . SAM ( v.o. ) it 's bleak , it 's beautiful . close up -- a hand tool some kind of rake or shovel half bury in the powdery soil , like a child 's toy abandon in a sand box . 5 . SAM ( v.o. ) ( cont 'd ) it 's barren , yet fill with rich . 11 ext . earth -- as see from the moon 11 from up here it be easy to see why the Earth be sometimes refer to as " the blue marble .

Sam switch a dial on a radio but get nothing but static - - he stick in a mini cd and skip the first few track . we hear brief clip of talk radio and shuttle through it before he allow it to play on , on some random american station -- a old weather report : voice on radio ... it 's a hot one on the East Coast , temperature soar to a high of ninety three degree in New York City -- they zip around the tiny kitchen , together prepare Sam 's breakfast , work as a team .

Sam step up to a wall of computer . a light be flash to indicate one of the pod be fill with helium3 . Sam do he thing , eventually remove a keg-size pod of helium3 . he haul it over to the Rover and stick it in a special slot in the equivalent of the Rover 's trunk . a new pod -- a empty -- replace the pod Sam just remove . Sam put he helmet back on , return to the Rover , reverse out of the harvester carefully . 25 I /e. rover / moon surface 25 Sam snake through the soil on he way back to base , the track of the Rover as sharp as if they have be make through talcum powder . the harvester churn into the distance .

SAM 1 ( cont 'd ) gerty , since I have be up here I have send tess over a hundred video message . where do that message go ? do they ever reach she ? a pause . gerty Sam , I can only account for what occur on the base . SAM 1 what about the message she send to I ? a long pause . finally gerty repeat : gerty Sam , I can only account for what occur on the base . SAM 1 gerty , be I really a clone ? gerty Sam , when you first arrive at selene , there be a small crash . you wake up in the infirmary . you suffer minor brain damage and memory loss . I keep you under observation and run some test . SAM 1 I remember . gerty Sam , there be no crash . you be be awaken . ( a beat ) it be standard procedure for all new clone to be give test to establish mental stability and general physical health . genetic abnormality and minor duplication error in the DNA can have considerable impact -- SAM 1 and tess ? Eve ? gerty they be memory implant , Sam . I be very sorry . 56 . Sam 1 nod at this . he 's broken-hearted . he begin to leave . gerty ( cont 'd ) Sam , it 's be several hour since you last meal . can I prepare you something ? SAM 1 no thanks , gerty . Sam 1 exit . CUT to : 101 int . sleeping quarter 101 Sam 1 enter the sleep quarter -- straighten the bed and lie down . he pick up the picture of the pregnant tess , stare at it long and hard . CUT to : 102 int . rec room -- later 102 the tv be off . Sam 2 be sit , arm fold , entrench in gloom . Sam 1 enter and head for the kitchen , prepare himself a snack . Sam 2 be aware that Sam 1 be there , but keep he eye focuss forward , as immobile as a statue . eventually Sam 1 tentatively come over . SAM 1 you okay ? SAM 2 I be stare into space . ( point to the window ) get it ? Sam 1 do get it . he smile to be polite , sit . SAM 2 ( cont 'd ) how 's the nose ? SAM 1 better . a beat . SAM 2 listen , I go haywire before . I lose it . I be sorry . 57 . SAM 1 it 's okay . SAM 2 no it 's not okay . I fuck up fairfield -- you model -- that 's unacceptable . I do not know what 's wrong with I . ( then ) I have get a temper . I need to do something about it . SAM 1 yes you do . a pause . SAM 2 I have be think . that rescue unit -- eliza -- they will be here in less than fourteen hour . I do not know about you but I would like to figure out where we stand before they get here . SAM 1 absolutely . SAM 2 ostensibly they be come to deal with the stall harvester . we both know that be not true . ( then ) they be come to dig you body out of that rover . they think you be in there . SAM 1 right . SAM 2 what will they reaction be when they find out you survive the crash ? I be not suppose to find you . lunar instruct gerty to lock I inside the base for Christ 's sake . a pause . Sam 1 think it over . SAM 2 ( cont 'd ) and there 's something else . something I have not tell you . ( a beat ) ( more ) 58 . SAM 2 ( cont 'd ) right around the time I be awaken ... I walk in on gerty talk to Central . he be have a live conversation . SAM 1 a live conversation ? SAM 2 yeah . SAM 1 that 's not possible . SAM 2 no no no , it be possible . it 's possible because I see it , that 's my point . Sam 2 feel himself lose he temper a little here . he reign himself in . SAM 1 how do you know the conversation be live ? SAM 2 it be a back and forth exchange . and I see Thompson and overmeyer up on the monitor . I be suppose to be asleep in the infirmary . the moment I walk into the comm room gerty terminate the transmission . now I be a little drugge up , grant , but I do not imagine it . SAM 1 the communication equipment be damage -- there be a solar storm -- SAM 2 tabitha . SAM 1 tabitha , right . SAM 2 lunar make it up . maybe . I do not know . bottom line be they do not want we to be able to contact Earth . otherwise why would they have lie to we ? a pause . Sam 1 stare forward , concentrate . Sam 2 concentrate on Sam 1 . 59 . SAM 1 how be they block the live feed ? the base 's communication equipment work fine -- SAM 2 maybe they be not block the signal from inside the base . SAM 1 from where then ? as if read each other mind , the two sam ' head turn to the window -- a slow , perfectly synchronize movement . the lunar landscape , as black and vast as ever . the view almost cruel in its emptiness . it 's not give they any answer , not yet . CUT to : 103 I /e. rover one / moon surface -- day 103 Sam 1 speed along in one of the rover . he wear he space suit and resemble a cosmic racing driver -- shift up a gear , the vehicle flirt with peak speed . he fly past one of the harvesters , speak through a microphone inside he helmet . SAM 1 just pass the last of the harvesters -- look like John -- all of this against the roar of the Rover 's engine . 104 I /e. rover two / moon surface 104 driving away from base in a different direction , Sam 2 . he also wear a space suit . he also gun the engine . he also have a microphone inside he helmet . the two clone be able to talk back and forth with no delay . SAM 2 how long until you be out of the base 's range ? we intercut between the two sam in they rover . SAM 1 if I maintain this speed ... a minute . ninety second top . SAM 2 you ever be this far out ? 60 . SAM 1 no , never . another angle -- second rover view from far away , the Rover 's speed less impressive from a distance . 105 I /e. rover's one and two / moon surface -- intercut 105 as the sam continue to drive . SAM 1 you see anything yet ? SAM 2 nothing . you ? SAM 1 there be not shit out here ... I feel like I be about to drive off the end of the world . ( then ) it would help if I know what I be look for . through the glass of Sam 1 's helmet we see he face suddenly shift . SAM 1 ( cont 'd ) wait a second , wait a second . Sam 1 squint and lean closer towards the windshield , like he 's try to decipher a road sign -- SAM 1 ( cont 'd ) I see something . SAM 1's Pov about a hundred foot away -- appear from thin air -- a massive metal pole stretch up into the black sky . SAM 2 what be it ? SAM 1 do not know yet . Sam 1 get closer . SAM 1 ( cont 'd ) look like some kind of antenna . 61 . SAM 2 antenna ? really ? ( then ) hang on , look like there 's one on this side too . Sam 2 be indeed approach something similar . Sam 1 stop he Rover about twenty foot from the jammer . he open the Rover 's door and step out to take a closer look . wide shot -- SAM 1 / rover take in the jammer and the adjacent Rover . Sam 1 lope towards the jammer , seemingly in slow motion . the jammer be gigantic -- a intimidating , stark pole stab into the lunar landscape , like the world biggest caber . next to it Sam 1 be tiny , a white dot , as insignificant as a pin prick . Sam 1 and Sam 2 we cut back and forth between the two sam as they both investigate the separate but identical - look jammer . SAM 2 ( cont 'd ) I can just make out the top . must be a hundred foot tall at least . it 's huge ! SAM 1 whoever build this thing mean business . they be not fuck around . they voice energized -- they be excited to have make this discovery -- they be not deal with the negative yet . SAM 1 ( cont 'd ) what do you think ? SAM 2 its not a antennae , dude . its a jammer . ( look around ) no wonder we can not get a live feed . this thing must be block we signal . suddenly Sam 1 double over . he vomit thick , viscous blood and sick into he helmet . revolting . the noise be audible over the microphone . 62 . SAM 2 ( cont 'd ) you okay ? no answer from Sam 1 . he collapse backwards onto the ground . his chest lurch like he 's be punch at from the inside -- he spin over onto he front -- SAM 2 ( cont 'd ) Sam ? Sam 1 manage to climb to he foot -- head slowly back to the Rover -- he dip in , close the door . SAM 2 ( cont 'd ) Sam , can you hear I ? SAM 1 yeah , I hear you . ( then ) I be go to head back to base . I be not feel too good . SAM 2 I will stay out here a little longer . I want to see if there be any more of this thing . Sam 1 pull a u-turn and begin he journey back to base . Sam 2 remain out by he jammer , investigate further . CUT to : 106 I /e. SAM 1's rover / moon surface 106 Sam 1 at the wheel . he have pull he helmet off within the safe pocket of the rover cabin . he 's a grizzly mess of splash sick and blood all over he face and chest . Sam 1 scream out with confusion , frustration , terror . SAM 1 fuck ! he seize the steering wheel , shake it fiercely -- beginning to really lose it -- 107 int . dock 107 Sam 1 drive he Rover into the dock -- not with he customary precision -- park at a angle , graze the wall . the Rover 's door jerk open and Sam 1 step out unsteadily , he face visibly pale through the glass of he helmet . 63. he stagger across the dock -- do not even close the Rover 's door behind he -- head into the corridor . 108 int . corridor 108 Sam 1 go swerving up the corridor like a drunkard -- banging into wall -- he finally reach the bathroom and duck in -- 109 int . bathroom 109 Sam 1 sink to he knee before the toilet bowl . with great effort he be able to remove he helmet , place it on the floor next to he . he stare into the toilet . for a moment all be calm . the gentle " ping -ping - ping " of a computer somewhere inside the base . Sam breathe steadily . spot of sweat on he upper lip . and then he vomit . he vomit loud , he vomit violently . his whole body thrust forward in the process , teach , tense , like a dog be yanked on a chain . Sam 1 vomit again . and again . and again . and stop . angle from above -- SAM 1 Sam 1 's vomit be dark red -- he 's throw up blood -- but that 's not all -- we can clearly see two or three teeth float in the vomit -- the mirror Sam 1 stand , move to the mirror , open he mouth wide to look for the miss tooth -- he use he thumb , show he gum -- revealing : yes , he 's lose at least a couple of tooth . he flush the toilet . CUT to : 110 ext . moon -- day 110 Sam 2 drive along in he Rover . he come across another one of this jammer . he drive right up , duck down , peer up through the windshield -- this new jammer be as tall as the other , in fact , it be identical in every way . how many of this thing be there ? 64 . Sam 2 circle the jammer in the Rover , drive on . CUT to : 111 int . monitoring station 111 Sam 1 enter and sit down at the Old man . frantically he start type in number . a array of log entry appear on the screen . Sam watch one of they . SAM 1 ( on screen ) January 12th , lunar hour 8:32 . all harvesters run smoothly today . readouts be as follow : Matthew , 12.7 mile ; Mark 11.9 mile ... this be just he log entry . what 's he look for ? Sam 1 start scrolling back through the log entry , like he 's rewinding chapter on a dvd , show himself at various stage of he time on selene -- he beard essentially grow in reverse as the message stretch further back -- eventually Sam 1 be clean shaven -- SAM 1 ( cont 'd ) ( on the screen ) luke , 12.9 mile ; John , 11.1 mile ... Sam 1 keep type in number . on the screen : " restricted . password require . " no go . he try to hack he way in , but be have no luck . one of gerty 's long spindly arm slide into the room . Sam back away from the intimidating piece of machinery , but it stop within reach of the computer . Sam 1 watch as the arm reach forward and tap the password in for he . it leave the room the way it come in . Sam 1 continue to go further and further back -- and suddenly he pop up on the screen again -- or be it he ? -- this Sam up on the screen have stubble -- no beard -- and look seriously ill -- he be barely able to talk -- in fact he 's slurring -- 65 . SAM ( on screen ) ... John , 15.1 mile ... sorry , I be not feel too hot today -- I be go to have to continue this later -- the sequence become a fast - pace and nightmarish montage -- continue to backtrack through the log entry -- show yet more sam -- one have a moustache -- one have a shave head -- one have grow out he hair and have a pony tail , we have see this particular Sam before in a earlier scene . but all the sam have one thing in common : towards the latter end of they log entry they all appear to be in very bad physical shape -- SAM 4 ... I have get blood come out of my nose ... SAM 5 I do not feel too well , Old man . SAM 6 my hair 's fall out ... look it . Sam 1 search even deeper into the computer and uncover yet more footage . we see the other sam return to Earth -- yet they do not seem to go anywhere -- when they blast off the return vehicle remain in its bay -- Sam 1 view different sam blast back to earth in the return vehicle -- always with the same result -- the return vehicle remain in its bay , the sam seemingly vanishing . in one particularly grainy sequence Sam 1 view gerty open the lid to the cryo pod in the return vehicle and beginning to vacuum what appear to be dust or debris -- Sam 1 understand now that the return vehicle be not a spacecraft , but some kind of incinerator . 112 int . return vehicle 112 Sam 1 head into the return vehicle . its dominate by the cryo pod , use to hold astronaut in a state of cryogenic sleep on they way back to Earth . Sam 1 pop open the lid and start frantically search the chamber for trace of the previous sam , eventually find particle of dust in the crack -- 66 . he close the lid . a video show a technician in a white lab coat begin to play on a screen aim at the glass lid of the pod . it 's mute , but we can hear a tinny version of the audio come from the cryo pod . Sam 1 push a button on the monitor and we hear the audio properly . technician ... relax and breathe deeply . the cryo pod be design to put you into a deep sleep for the duration of you three day return journey back to Earth . as you begin to get sleepy , think about the magnificent job you have do , and how proud you family be of what you have accomplish . relaxing music begin to play . after a moment the music stop . there be a pause . then a almighty pulse of light from the cryo pod . this be how sam past have meet they end . nuke to ash like microwave meal in the cryo pod . Sam 1 inspect the control of the spacecraft to see if it really be a vehicle -- in the process of he search he find himself down on he knee check out the wiring . suddenly Sam 1 's attention be on the floor beneath he . he appear to be kneel on some kind of panel -- like a tablet in the return vehicle 's floor -- he press he ear against the panel -- knock -- the panel sound hollow . cubby Sam 1 open a cubby , swipe something similar to a crow bar , head out of the frame -- return vehicle back in the return vehicle , Sam 1 stand over the panel in the floor . he use the crow bar to prize the panel open -- this take a extraordinary effort -- the panel eventually lifting like a manhole cover . Sam 1 can not believe he eye . at the top of the OPEN panel , lead down into darkness ... there 's a ladder . 113 int . dock 113 Sam 2 return from he tour of the perimeter of the base ; pull up alongside Sam 1 's Rover , have to compensate for he clone 's poor parking job . 67 . 114 int . corridor 114 Sam 2 exit the parking Bay and remove he helmet . down the corridor he see Sam 1 stand outside the return vehicle : face he , wait . SAM 2 I see three more of that jammer . the base be surround . I print out they coordinate -- Sam 2 begin to remove a piece of paper from he pocket , but suddenly stop . he can tell by Sam 1 's expression that something have happen . SAM 2 ( cont 'd ) what ? what be it ? SAM 1 I find you secret room . CUT to : 115 int . return vehicle 115 stand over the open panel , a anxious Sam 1 and Sam 2 stare down . SAM 2 who go first ? Sam 1 wordlessly take the lead , crouching slightly to seize the ladder and twist he body down into the hole . he begin to descend . when he be roughly half way down Sam 2 follow . 116 int . lower deck / chamber -- continuous 116 Sam 1 reach the bottom of the ladder . he 's in a dark room , a kind of chamber -- if NASA do crypt , it would look like this . the only light source right now be the come from the return vehicle up above . Sam 2 hop down beside Sam 1 , squint into the darkness . SAM 2 be there a light ? both sam fumble along oppose wall -- Sam 1 eventually find a switch , snap it on . a array of overhead fluorescent bulb begin to stutter and flash before illuminating the chamber completely -- 68 . the two sam can hardly believe they eye : stretch back maybe fifty foot be row and row of pod -- like upright glass coffin -- and stand inside each pod , a as-of - yet unawakened clone . it 's like a entire army of Sam bell ... spooky as hell . for a few moment Sam 1 and 2 be too stunne to speak . they walk to the end of the chamber and back again , look at each clone one at a time -- all the clone be bare chest and wear some kind of white cloth to cover they genitals , like a diaper . of course they all look the same , that 's why they be clone , but this piece of scientific wizardry be mind - boggle to Sam 1 and 2 -- they marvel at how each of the clone be identical in every way , and down to the minutest of detail -- same length of hair , same skin tone , same fingernails -- SAM 2 ( cont 'd ) why be there so many of they ? SAM 1 the cryo pod in the return vehicle be a incinerator . Sam 2 react with appropriate shock . SAM 2 what ? SAM 1 we do not go home . we be burn to death up there . then the company wake up a new one . every three year . like clock work . Sam 2 absorb this . then : SAM 2 how do you know all this ? SAM 1 ( beat ) I hack into the Old man . actually , gerty do . I see footage . you be right , there have be other clone before we . SAM 2 how many ? SAM 1 enough . a pause . 69 . SAM 2 if that rescue unit find the two of we awake at the same time , they will kill we both for sure . Sam 1 do not respond , he 's in he own world . SAM 2 ( cont 'd ) what be we go to do ? all of a sudden Sam 1 make a beeline for the ladder , start head back up . SAM 2 ( cont 'd ) where be you go ? 117 int . monitoring station -- moment later 117 Sam 1 be digging in drawer , remove some equipment , some wire ; a radio , a small machine call a video phone , refer to as a vp . he be watch by gerty . gerty Sam , can I help you with something ? SAM 1 not now , gerty , okay ? gerty begin to slide out of the room . Sam call after he . SAM 1 ( cont 'd ) gerty ? why do you help I ? with the password ? do not that go against you programming or something ? gerty helping you be what I do . gerty leave . Sam 1 go on pick up equipment , shove it all into a backpack he swipe from a peg . now Sam 2 appear in the doorway . SAM 2 what 's go on ? SAM 1 there 's something I have get to do . 70 . Sam 1 brushes by Sam 2 on he way out . 118 int . dock 118 Sam 1 march up to he Rover , toss in the backpack and dip inside without he helmet , close the door and back out into the black day . 119 I /e. SAM 1's rover / moon surface 119 Sam 1 at the wheel , flooring the Rover -- he look possess , determine -- a man on a mission -- wide shot Sam 's Rover approach one of the many jammer that we now know circle the perimeter of the base . Sam 1 stop the Rover on the other side of the jammer . here , outside the range of the jammer , he figure he might be able to get a signal through to Earth . on SAM as he remove he equipment from the backpack and start to uncoil wire -- insert a small battery pack onto the back of the vp , sit the vp on he lap . the vp resemble a play Station portable with its small but nonetheless high - quality screen . Sam be not sure who to contact at first ... finally he enter some number from memory . the vp shaking in he hand . he be nervous , scared . he disable the video mode on he end , so he be only send audio . a moment of silence . the vp seem dead . SAM 1 come on ... come on ... then the vp beeps -- the monitor blip -- the message seem to have go through . and suddenly a girl appear on the screen . Sam 1 can not believe it . it 's the same girl from he hallucination . same wheat - color hair . same freckle dotting she cheek bone . same yellow dress . the moment Sam 1 see the girl he think -- naturally -- that he 's imagine thing again . but then she speak : girl hello ? 71 . that 's never happen before . Sam 1 finally manage to respond : SAM 1 uh , Bell residence ? the conversation have a very slight delay , maybe a second or two , and the girl be not completely clear on the monitor . we assume that this minor technical glitches be the same on the girl 's end . the girl be sweet , chirpy -- nothing like the haunt , ghost - like figure from Sam 1 's hallucination . girl this be the Bell residence . SAM 1 I be try to reach tess Bell . the girl 's expression shift -- now somewhere between melancholy and curiosity -- girl I be sorry , she pass away some year ago . Sam 1 gasp . he literally gasp . like someone just plunge a pare knife into he belly . SAM 1 no ...no way . the girl just stare . SAM 1 ( cont 'd ) tess Bell ? be you sure ? girl uh , yeah , I think so . I be she daughter . ( then ) can I help you ? and astonishingly , the news of tess 's death actually take a back seat as Sam 1 be force to confront this new revelation . the girl be eve bell . Sam 1 be talk to he daughter . Sam 1 tilt he head , a smile twitches on he face . SAM 1 Eve ? Sam 1 can not believe it . she 's beautiful . she 's beautiful . 72 . eve bell yes ? a moment . Eve look more closely , try to decipher Sam 1 's face . tear glisten in he eye . SAM 1 ( overwhelm ) hi ... hi. eve. how old be you now ? for a second Eve be embarrassed -- she blushes slightly -- but be still pull in , intrigue . eve bell I be fifteen . ( then ) do I know you ? SAM 1 how do mom die , sweetheart ? eve bell uh ... now Eve be beginning to look spook . she turn away from the screen and call to someone in another room : eve bell ( cont 'd ) dad ! and then we hear a voice . Sam 's voice . sam' voice ( o.s. ) what ! eve bell dad , there 's someone ask about mom ... Sam 's voice sound closer , more succinct , as he come into the room -- but we do not see he yet -- he sound , older . sam' voice who 's ask about mom ? Sam 1 hurriedly shut off the vp . he sit there in the Rover , on the Moon , the middle of nowhere -- hundred and thousand of mile from Earth -- Sam 1 have never feel more alone than he do right now . 73. 120 ext . rover / moon surface 120 the Rover view from outside . we can not hear a thing . just the endless and unrelent moon silence . Inside the Rover we be able to make out Sam 1 , quivering at the wheel as he sob . CUT to : 121 int . comm room 121 close up -- the old man the " ping - ping - ping " of a alarm . appear on the Old man 's monitor : " rescue unit eliza : arrival time , 12 hour and 22 minute .

Sam 2 hear a sound from the corridor . moment later Sam 1 appear in the doorway wear the backpack . Sam 1 be beginning to look alarmingly ill . his deplete health have be evident throughout the film , but now it seem to have jump to a new level . he watch Sam 2 for a little while . SAM 1 want I to help ? Sam 2 shift over to give Sam 1 the adjacent chair . Sam 1 walk over , sit down . together they work on glue the church back together . SAM 1 ( cont 'd ) remember that crazy drunk guy who use to hang out by the church ? SAM 2 Barbara streisand ? 74 . SAM 1 ( with a smile ) he look like Barbara streisand . we use to hide he Bible when he pass out . drive the guy nut . Sam 2 nod , remember . a pause . SAM 2 how do you carve this thing ? SAM 1 want I to show you ? Sam 2 nod . Sam 1 pick up a block of wood , grab a exacto blade . demonstrate . SAM 1 ( cont 'd ) you need to hold the wood away from you . like this . SAM 2 you be shaking . Sam 2 be not kid . though he be carve the block of wood , Sam 1 can not keep it steady . SAM 2 ( cont 'd ) why be you shaking ? SAM 1 watch what I be do . ( then ) you watch ? SAM 2 yeah . SAM 1 now you try . Sam 1 hand the wood and exacto blade to Sam 2 . Sam 2 attempt to whittle . he smile , a little embarrassed . SAM 2 I suck . SAM 1 you will get the hang of it . ( a beat ) you see , that 's a little better already . 75 . suddenly Sam 1 turn around and have a vicious cough fit . it actually seem to propel Sam 1 out of he chair and up onto he foot . Sam 2 watch with concern . eventually the cough subside . SAM 2 what 's happen to you ? Sam 1 avert he gaze . SAM 2 ( cont 'd ) listen , I realize I have be less than cooperative . but I want to change that . you and I , we need to work together . and that start with not keep secret from each other .

I have get a constant headache . dizzy spell . ( a beat ) the same thing happen to the other clone . I see it when I hack into the Old man . after three year they all start to get sick . now it 's happen to I . well , it 's be happen for a while now . a couple of week . SAM 2 what do you think it be ? SAM 1 maybe we do not live that long . maybe we start to decompose or something . SAM 2 Jesus . suddenly Sam 1 close he eye -- sways -- look like he 's go to pass out . SAM 2 ( cont 'd ) hey hey hey , you okay ? 76 . Sam 2 stand and move to Sam 1 . hold he up , check he temperature . SAM 2 ( cont 'd ) why do not you lie down for a while ? take some tranqs . get some sleep . SAM 1 ( grim smile ) no tranqs .

Sam 2 walk up . SAM 2 gerty , I need to talk to you . gerty of course , Sam , how can I help ? SAM 2 we find the hide room . we know about the other clone . a long pause . then : gerty I do not know of a hide room . 78 . SAM 2 the hide room under the return vehicle , gerty . you know what I be talk about . we find it on we own . lunar do not know anything about it . a beat . gerty the lower deck be out of bound to awaken clone -- SAM 2 ordinarily , gerty , but what with there be two of we awake at the same time , and what with the situation be unprecedented , the rule have have to change . do you understand ? gerty I understand the situation be unprecedented . SAM 2 good. ( a beat ) gerty , how long do it take for a clone to wake up ? gerty a clone be awake the moment he pod be open . but he be not fully conscious for several hour . a beat . SAM 2 gerty , we need to wake up a new clone . gerty I be not permit to do that , Sam . SAM 2 if we do not wake up another clone I and the other Sam will die . we will die , gerty . do you understand ? gerty yes . 79 . SAM 2 do you want I and the other Sam to die ? gerty that be the last thing I want . SAM 2 then you have to wake up a new clone . okay , pal ? Sam 2 wait for a response . and wait .
