war horse written by Lee Hall &amp ; Richard curtis 1. ext . devon , england . a summer' day , 1912 . the bucolic magnificence of the Devon countryside . we fly low over the high , thick hedge untouched for hundred of year . the thick verdant countryside in all its splendor , ancient woodland , field of corn , and finally a paddock in a typical devonshire dale . we come to rest beside three farmer stand over a pregnant mare . the mare be in distress - she be about to give birth . the farmer calm the mare and tend to she gently with assurance and authority . we pull back to see , albert , a fifteen - year - old farm boy , watch the whole drama with delight from the paddock gate . farmer come on , easy , girl . easy , girl . easy . the man hold the mare firmly , but clearly this be a difficult birth . farmer 2 this be a stubborn one , huh ? farmer 3 there we go . who 's a clever girl ? moment later - the summer 's sun glint off the wet , sticky hide of the foal ( joey ) - red hide , four white sock and a distinctive white cross on its forehead . soon the creature be attempt its first clumsy step . it be both awesome and comical to see the new bear creature struggle to he foot , but eventually , he succeed . title : war horse ext . paddock / field , devon . various . we follow joey 's progress over the course of he first year . his initial fearfulness , he connection with he mother , the intimacy of they relationship . as joey get strong they run together , frolick gayly in the last dregs of summer . Albert look on . joey notice he at the fence and they share a moment of connection . spring : flower be beginning to sprout by the hedgerow . we boy Albert run into the field . he take a apple from he pocket - he hold it out tentatively . joey approach Albert with suspicion . Albert gently encourage he . 2 . his mother paw the ground and neigh at joey . he turn and run over the field at she beck and call . Albert toss the apple to himself , ruefully - watch in awe as joey race away with he mother . he be a magnificent one year old . his distinctive red coat gleam , now it be clear that he be half thoroughbre . he run quickly around the field enjoy he own power and strength . later - the three farmer open the gate and come into the field . both joey and he mother instinctively canter over to the two man , expect food . the three man gently greet the horse and pet they , then we see one man have a noose make of a rope . he slip it round mum 's neck . she pull back , joey be shake and bewilder but before he know what 's happen the second farmer be try to get a similar rope around he neck . joey balk and push the farmer aside , distress to see he mother tethere . the farmer grab joey again and struggle with he , enlist the help of the second farmer . with some effort they get the rope around he neck and calm he down . farmer 2 easy do it . easy do it . come on , steady do it . unuse to be tethere joey pull at the rope but the farmer be solid and firm . they gently lead joey and he mother across the field to the gate and out into the road . the whole road become overtaken by a flock of sheep on they way to the market . in the distance we hear the bustle of market Day . ext . the market . the same . the farmer lead joey and he mother through the chaos of the market and into a auction pen . they find themselves amongst a hoard of pig , sheep and cow . joey be agog at all of this creature and all this life he have no idea exist . the farmer lead the horse into a stall to await the auction . joey be bewilder by all the noise - buttress against a couple of mule and a cow . he be uncomfortable in this tight space . a auction worker hold a clipboard out for the lead farmer . auction man 1 mornin ' , pop . put you mark here . good luck . 3. ext . joey' pen . the same . two man approach the pen . auction man 2 get the colt ... one man grab joey and pull he out of the pen . suddenly there be a look of horror on he face . his terrify mother realise they be be separate . joey panic and desperately try to get back to he mother , he rise up throw the man who be lead he aside . joey be out of control . the man regains control of joey . auction man 3 whoa ! whoa ! he pull joey away from he mother , who let out a heart - rending cry , paw the ground , and crash she foreleg against the fence . joey remain disorient in the midst of the market day chaos . auction man 3 ( cont 'd ) easy ... int .

Soldiers scurry around the giant gun , prepare it . officer halt ! halt ! take the horse away ! artillery officer Shell ! friedrich observe with topthorn as a giant shell be carry to the gun 's breech . artillery officer ( cont 'd ) and load ! the man wrestle it into place - artillery officer ( cont 'd ) back ! case ! - and secure it . artillery officer ( cont 'd ) position ! the barrel of the giant gun ratchet upward . artillery officer ( cont 'd ) and ...fire ! the shell explode from the barrel . and then from another . and another . for the first time we see the big picture - the line of assemble cannon of which they be just one tiny part . 76 . each gun recoil violently as they shoot they shell into oblivion - as soon as one shell be fire another be load - the noise be deafen - the line seemingly endless - a obscene production line of death . this be what the horse have be feed - this massive merciless thing . smoke waft from the gun as we see the explosion in the distance . the sound of the explosion take we to - ext . british trench . night . explosion light the dirty face of british boy in uniform , one after the next . each light fade out before the next great blast illuminate another anonymous face - then another - and then another - and then albert . hold on he for extra moment before he fade completely . ext . british trench . early dawn . title : FRANCE - 1918 , the somme with the barrage lift , the british soldier that be huddle in a low sub-trench , be order back on the line . Andrew easton be with Albert and he 's shake and terrify . a far cry from the happy young boy we know . a gruff sergeant ( sergeant martin ) walk the trench with a bucket and each soldier put in they valuable and personal belonging . one a lighter , some money , etc . sergeant martin valuable in the bucket , lad . if you live , you will get they back . if you live , you will get they back . good lad . Albert and Andrew move down the trench in a line of soldier who be give ammo belt and grenade . Albert get he grenade and walk further along the trenches . we follow he in real time as he pass a bunch of soldier who be kneel in the ankle deep water , a padre be give they communion . the deafen noise of shelling all around . andrew maybe it 's a drill , albie . maybe it 's a drill like last time . we keep follow Albert 's progress in real time - further on there be a post box where they all put they final letter home in identical green envelope . we see Albert 's letter address to " Ted and Rose narracott " in Devon . he post it in a batter metal post box . 77 . a officer approach : david Love letter ? albert that 's my business . it be David - lyon 's son - now in charge of this small group of man . still arrogant - look older than Albert in he uniform - and clearly enjoy he superior rank . david I hear you and you mate be do bird imitation again . you gonna write a letter to you horse ? Albert ignore he . Andrew can not help but giggle . david ( cont 'd ) after you find you horse , I have lose my needle in a haystack , and I could use some help . David take up a bucket and walk down the line of soldier . david ( cont 'd ) anything valuable . anyone who come back get to share it out . albert ( to andrew ) stay here .

David point to he , smirk . david ( cont 'd ) you see ? always entertaining , narracott , I will give you that . as David walk on , Andrew smile at Albert . andrew you do that ? you fall on you bum ? Albert leave without answer . Andrew keep smile until a large shell explode nearby . troops surge towards they ladder as officer scream indistinct order . now David lead he troop through the trenches to the front line where they stop , lean against the enemy - side wall nervously and wait - each man in private contemplation . sergeant Martin move along the line , push man forward . sergeant martin be ready ! be ready ! let 's go , man , get ready to go ! get ready to move out ! stay in position ! David call out from atop a trench ladder . david hold you nerve , boy . remember , it 's not far to go . there 's a way through .

David turn to Albert and Andrew . david come on , boy , come on . to the ladder ! albert ( to andrew ) stick close to the gentry , that 's we ticket , yeah ? we have the pluck but they have the luck . they both smile . and then the fear take over again . Andrew particularly feel as though he be on the very edge now . David urge they forward . david you , too , narracott . ( to andrew ) and you , too . Andrew and Albert pass by the bucket . they throw some valuable in . but a moment later , Albert go back to the bucket and pull something out - a wear piece of paper - he unfold it - it be the little sketch that Captain nicholl draw of joey the night before they leave for France . he slip it inside he shirt , next to he heart . 80 . david ( cont 'd ) come on , on you ladder , boy . on you ladder . in you go , in you go . that 's it . Andrew turn towards a ladder . as fate and placement would have it - he be first in line . he put he foot on the ladder , when suddenly the sergeant stop he . sergeant martin listen to you sergeant ! he pull Andrew aside , speak so that everyone can hear . sergeant martin ( cont 'd ) if anybody turn back , if any one of we boy come run towards you - you take this rifle and you shoot they dead . do you understand ? soldier yes , sir ! the sergeant push in on Andrew , private and intense . sergeant do you understand I ? do you understand what I be tell you , son ? you take this rifle and you shoot they dead . understand ? Andrew look ready to cry , but manage to nod . Albert turn to he , only to be push back by the sergeant . sergeant ( cont 'd ) up there , son . up you ladder . up you ladder to you work ! Albert look nervously back at Albert , comforting . albert it 's good . Andrew , it 's good . Andrew ! nobody 's retreate today . Andrew ! Andrew ! nobody . be retreate . today . the commander arrive , check the time on he aide 's watch , mount he ladder and blow a whistle to signal the charge . a bagpiper play as the man go over the top . David now head up the ladder first . gun fire overhead , Albert steel himself , then haul himself over the top , follow by the next man and the next . 81 . immediately machine gun fire whistle past , we hear the scream of the first man who be shot . we follow Albert . we be he . his vision . his experience . the ground be blast , there be body all around he . he try to run but he foot sink into the mud . bullet fly past he . fell man be scream at he foot in fear and agony . Albert stagger forward . David be now right by he . they run together . Albert look round and suddenly , David be hit . he fall to the ground , scream . david I be shot ! no ! Albert instinctively go to help . bullet shower all around he . david ( cont 'd ) just leave I . leave I ! Albert grab he and drag he onwards with he - David scream at the pain - Albert grimly determine . shell explode around they as they stumble on . other man be run and fall . Albert see cover in a huge shell - hole so dive into it for a moment 's reprieve from the gun fire . he sit in still terror for a moment . albert you will be all right here . you will be safe . someone will come for ya . david Albert . Albert , listen ... albert it 's all right . it 's all right . we be Devon boy , yeah ? David look at Albert as though see he for the first time . david yeah ... Albert race onward . back at the trench , Andrew wait - terrify - and then , back out of the mist step two man - head back towards he . then a third . they suddenly catch sight of Andrew wait there with he gun point towards they . they slow down - in the terror of the assault , they have forget that death be wait for they if they turn back . 82. time seem to slow down - Andrew shift he gun from point at one - to the other - we see they individual face . they be all just boy really . and suddenly , instinct hit Andrew - he charge up the ladder , and forward , fire - past the three man , towards the enemy . he choose he death instead of theirs . a sudden barrage of machine gun fire all around he . cut back to Albert , who make he way to the edge of the shell hole . bullet whizz inch from he head . he look over to see a german machine gun position to he right . bullet whizz past force he to duck . Andrew charge past other soldier , ignore they warning . random soldier get down ! Albert continue forward to dive into another shell hole , nearer to the german line . he scramble from shell hole to shell hole . now he 's very close to the machine gun position . Albert take a grenade , fumble with the pin as he hand tremble . he finally get the pin out and he hurl the grenade at the machine gunner . we see the explosion and the machine gun stop . Albert sprint over the top again and make it all the way into the german trench . Albert run through the trench , which seem curiously empty . Albert swing round as he see the startling face of a gas - mask german hold a rifle on he . Albert ready he bayonet but the man be dead , slump backwards against the side of the trench still upright . Albert spin round , he bayonett rifle in front of he , ready for action , but there be only the ghostly sight of dead german soldier . Albert be alone , everyone else be dead . all the dead wear gas mask . more british soldier drop into the trench , among they Andrew . he stumble in the mud , drop he rifle , recover it , and race through the trench . he glimpsis Albert ahead of he , stalking through the mist . Andrew break into a smile and rush forward , prompt Albert to whirl with he rifle raise . andrew no ! 83. Albert pause just in time . then he collapse against the side of the trench , overwhelm . andrew ( cont 'd ) albie . Andrew grab Albert and hold he up , embrace he . Albert can barely whisper : albert we make it . we make it . a moment later , the pair of they hurry through the trenches . Albert spot more comrade around a corner and call ahead to Andrew . albert ( cont 'd ) Andrew , this way out ! suddenly another soldier leap from a trench branch between they , shouting in panic . soldier Gas ! gas! Gas ! a instant later , a gas cloud blast through the trench . Andrew and Albert look in horror . it spread towards they , too powerful to avoid . Andrew be close , turn to Albert with a helpless - andrew albie ... - before he take the full power of it . a instant later , the white , deadly cloud encompass Albert , too ... ext . edge of the battlefield . dusk . Close on hoof and boot , slogging through muddy water , several inch deep . friedrich be walk along , lead topthorn and joey . topthorn be limping . something be wrong - topthorn seem to be fail - he cough badly , breathes strangely . friedrich stop to check on he . a officer notice . german officer hey , there 's no stop here . keep they move . 84 . friedrich Sir , there 's something wrong . this one need to rest . german officer there 's no rest for they . move they along . move they along ! instead , friedrich lead the horse under the cover of a low bridge for a brief respite . a moment later , topthorn collapse . friedrich please , please , please . stay on you foot . no , please . no no no ... friedrich try to help topthorn valiantly struggle to get up but finally sink to the ground again . this time he lie semi-conscious . he be die . friedrich ( cont 'd ) please please ... stay on you foot . joey deeply upset nuzzle he nose into topthorn but the life drain out he . friedrich be in panic at topthorn 's quick decline : friedrich ( cont 'd ) come on . please please ... friedrich continue to stroke topthorn 's head . joey push topthorn as if to stop he fall into unconsciousness . for a moment we think topthorn will come round but he slip away and all life leave he body . friedrich solemnly stroke the horse , know all be lose . joey do not understand . he pull at topthorn 's rein , as if try to pull he upright . topthorn 's body be inert , he head fall to the earth . joey will not give up , he pull at he desperately not understanding that topthorn have die . suddenly , friedrich look around . Chaos - all the german soldier stream back past they position , scramble to get they gun and helmet . a officer charge down the bank next to the bridge , scream order at friedrich . german officer they be come ! leave it , private ! friedrich try to pull joey away to safety but joey will not leave topthorn 's body . friedrich pull at joey , but joey be too lose in he grief to care about or even notice the danger . 85 . german officer ( cont 'd ) leave it ! come with I ! friedrich go to hell ! the officer nod to two other soldier who pull friedrich to safety . as he 's drag away , he scream at joey : friedrich ( cont 'd ) run. run! run! run! but this be all background noise to joey 's profound refusal to accept topthorn be dead . he paw at the ground next to topthorn , a horse stand over he best friend in a field , and he will never leave he . and then suddenly - from around a blind turn in the streambed , a huge , remorseless tank turn , head right for joey . he bolt , gallop down the streambed , until he reach a barb wire barrier - a dead end . he attempt to run up the bank , but they be block , as well . he rear up , but the tank keep advance . the tank be about to crush joey . he have leave it too late . he be about to die . but then , counter - intuitively , he run straight towards the tank and ... leap over it - a leap he learn from emilie . then scramble up and over it and leap down behind . joey keep on run . he be wild , frighten . ext . countryside / village / trench . the same . joey be free - in countryside - but there be blood pour from he leg , clearly tear by he encounter with the tank . he run on - it be become night - suddenly there be explosion to the leave of he - this fast , elegant creature simply run through the gap between explosion . but as he charge on - the sky light up in the direction he be head . he be suddenly in the thick of battle . a shell explode next to he , and he leap entirely over a trench . another explosion send he leaping , but not far enough - he find himself crash downward , and into a trench - and he race through it - and find himself charge towards a german company . both side be equally startle - joey charge through a thin trench line with german soldier - the soldier , find a live horse career through they . in desperation , joey scramble out of the trench - and once again , rush away from the fight ... 86 . but now it be very dark indeed - he be stumbling as he run - there be blood mix with the mud on he leg . now it be total night - fog - confusion - he jump again . and now everywhere there be pothole - the land be massively uneven - shell be explode all around . and suddenly see in front of he barb wire . he crash through it - more - he burst through again - now drag barrier behind he - the barrier tangle , pull he up short - he flip and land amongst even more barb wire . he pull and turn to release himself but it be impossible . the more he pull , the more firmly he be trap . he rise up , wild , magnificent , a beast fight for he life . he be completely trap . he can not move . he can not see . he be in pain . he fall . it feel like a end . ext . british trench . the same . geordie soldier ( o.s. ) stand to , stand to - a young soldier , a geordie , be on look - out duty . he look through a periscope . he alert he colleague in he thick , northern , newcastle accent . geordie soldier ( cont 'd ) there 's something move . soldier what the hell be it ?

Peter stand and shout in the direction of he trench . peter we need more wire cutter ! all at once one , two , three , six pair of cutter come soar through the air and splash into the watery crater . moment later - Peter and the geordie kneel beside joey , each with a pair of cutter . joey be calming down again . the geordie position himself across joey 's body so that when he 's cut the wire , it will not coil back and cut joey . Peter position himself to be able to cut the two wire in quick succession , hold the first wire to stop it from spring back . joey 's completely still now . Peter point between joey 's eye . peter ( cont 'd ) his blind spot . the cutter will not frighten he . if you could cut here , hold this wire - he point to wire that intersect the wire that cross joey 's eye . then he point to the wire across joey 's eye . 92 . peter ( cont 'd ) I could - geordie say no more , I be right behind you . as they reposition themselves , the geordie say to joey : geordie ( cont 'd ) and you understand what 's happen , do you not , o best belove ? that you must lay so very nice and still . there 's a lad , you be a remarkable horse , you be , help we help you . there 's a lad . there 's a remarkable lad . the geordie look into joey 's huge eye as he and Peter get to work on they cut . joey return he gaze . geordie ( cont 'd ) so how 's thing in yonder trench ? peter delightful . we read , we knit sweater , and we train we rat to perform circus trick . geordie well , if ever you need any more rat , we can always send ours over . ` Cause we have more than we need , strictly speak . besides , they scare off all the pretty girl . peter we girl be not afraid of rat . geordie Big strapping german girl , eh? kind what give robust massage ? they laugh . peter every Thursday ! and they bring rum cake on you birthday . both man smile at this while joey be completely still ; they work quickly , in concert , cut the horse 's head free of the wire . 93. joey raise he head , give it a shake , neigh and then stir a little . the two soldier smile at one another . then they set about cut the rest of the wire ; it 's much easier now . the geordie cut through the last wire bind joey 's leg . the two soldier help as the horse stagger upright . geordie look at that horse ! look at the muscle he 's get , they long leg . they be make for run , horse . runnin ' away from danger . peter running away be all they have . geordie yet we teach `em opposite . running into the fray . peter War horse . geordie yeah .
