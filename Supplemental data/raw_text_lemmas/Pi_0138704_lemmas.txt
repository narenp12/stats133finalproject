Max just want to get out of there . ephraim pray in the background . max lenny , I do not really want to do ... lenny meyer do it for I ? it mean a lot , have someone of you stature perform a mitzvah in my presence . ( beat ) when you tell I you name be Max Cohen , I do not realize you be the Max Cohen . maximilian Cohen . max you know I ? lenny meyer 0f course , I have follow you research since you Columbia day . it 's revolutionary . you have inspire the work we do . max I have ? lenny meyer yes , very much so . the only difference be , we be not look at stock . we be search for a pattern in torah . lenny finish wrapping Max 's arm . he reach for another box and strap . max what kind of pattern ? lenny meyer we be not really sure . we calculation have show we that there be a number encode in the text . max what sort of number ? lenny meyer we do not know . all we know be that it 's two hundred and sixteen digit long . Max , stunne look at lenny . lenny meyer do not worry . this one just go over you head . lenny place the other teffilin over Max 's head . Max collect himself . max ( coolly ) two sixteen ? lenny meyer yes . now we have to say a small prayer , repeat after I . bewildere , Max do . after the prayer ... lenny meyer that 's it . be not so bad , be it ? you feel anything ? lenny start remove the teffillin from Max . max what be it ? lenny meyer it 's a prayer about we dedication to we one and only God . max ( attempt calmness ) no , I mean the number , the two sixteen number ? what be it ? lenny meyer oh . we do not know . we just know that it 's the most common number encode in the text . it might be some type of linguistic pattern . if we could figure out what the number be we could maybe answer that . max tell I more . ext . sol' apartment - dawn Max firmly ring SOL 's bell . in a few moment , sol answer the door in he pajamas . SOL Max ? max what 's go on , sol !? SOL relax , it 's early . int . sol' kitchen - moment later Max sit at the kitchen table while sol heat up a pot of tea . Max be shaking . SOL now , what 's up ? max what 's the two hundred and sixteen number , sol ? SOL Excuse I ? max you ask I if I have see a two hundred and sixteen digit number , right ? SOL oh , you mean the bug . I find it work on pi . max what do you mean by " find it " ? SOL what 's this all about , Max ? max well , there 's this religious Jews who have ... SOL Religious Jews ? max well , you know , hassidim . I meet one in the coffee shop . the guy 's a number theorist . the torah be they data set . the thing be , they be search for a two hundred and sixteen digit number in the torah . SOL really ? what 's it mean to they ? max they say they do not know , but that 's crazy . I mean what be the odd ... SOL it 's just a coincidence . max but hold on , there 's something else . you remember that strange pick I get . SOL yesterday 's stock pick ? max right . well , it turn out that they be correct . I hit two pick on the nose . smack on the nose . SOL ( surprise ) hmmm . max something 's go on , and it have to do with that number . the answer be there . SOL Max , it 's a bug . max no. it 's a pattern . a pattern be in that number SOL come with I . int . SOL be study - moment later sol and Max sit on either side of a half - play go board . SOL listen to I . the ancient japanese consider the go board to be a microcosm of the universe . although when it be empty it appear to be simple and order , in fact , the possibility of game play be endless . they say that no two go game have ever be alike . just like snowflake . so , the go board actually represent a extremely complex and chaotic universe . that be the truth of we world , Max . it can not be easily sum up with math . there be no simple pattern . max but as a go game progress , the possibility become smaller and smaller . the board do take on order . soon , all move be predictable . SOL so ? max so , maybe , even though we be not sophisticated enough to be aware of it , there be a underlying order ... a pattern , beneath every go game . maybe that pattern be like the pattern in the market , in the torah . the two sixteen number . SOL that be insanity , Max . max or maybe it 's genius . I have to get that number . SOL hold on , you have to slow down . you be lose it , you have to take a breath . listen to yourself . you be connect a computer bug I have , a computer bug you might have have , and some religious hogwash . if you want to find the number two sixteen in the world , you will be able to pull it out of anywhere . two hundred and sixteen step from you street comer to you front door . two hundred and sixteen second you spend riding on the elevator . when you mind become obsessed with anything , it will filter everything else out and find example of that thing everywhere . Three hundred and twenty , four hundred and fifty , twenty - three . whatever ! you have choose two sixteen and you will find it everywhere in nature . but Max , as soon as you discard scientific rigor , you be no longer a mathematician . you become a numerologist . what you need to do be take a break from you research . you need it . you deserve it here 's a hundred dollar , I want you to take it . if , you will not take it , borrow it . either way , take a break . spend it however you like as long as it fall in the category of vacation . Real world stuff , okay . no math . Max look at he band . SOL just try it . in a week you will laugh about this . c'mon , Max . think about it ! Max give a half nod . ext . sol' apartment - morning Max rush to the subway when a honk horn stop he . a limo pull up next to he . marcy Dawson jump out of the car marcy dawson Mr. Cohen ?

I know ... clearly we be seek different type of perfection , but that be what make we perfect candidate for a fruitful partnership . if you let I , I can be you great ally . take the acacia tree ... in East Africa . it be the most prevalent plant in all of kenya because it have manage to secure its niche by defeat its major predator , the giraffe . to accomplish this , the tree have make a contract with a highly specialize red ant . the tree have evolve giant spore which act as housing for the ant in return for shelter , the ant supply defense . when a giraffe start to eat the tree 's leave , the shaking branch act like a alarm . the ant charge out and secrete a acid onto the giraffe 's tongue . the giraffe learn its lesson and never return . without each other , the tree would be pick dry and the ant would have no shade from the brutal African sun both would die . but with each other , they succeed , they survive , they surpass . they have different aim , different goal but they work together . Max , we would like to establish a mutually benefit alliance with you . max ( hand back the stopwatch ) I be not interested . marcy dawson allow I to dose . the chauffeur pull a black suitcase out of the limo and bring it over . marcy dawson as a sign of good faith we wish to offer you this . max I tell you I do not want money . marcy dawson the suitcase be not fill with fifty or gold or diamond . just silicon . a ming Mecca chip . max ( yeah right ! ) ming Mecca . they be not declassify . Max start to move away . marcy dawson you be right . they be not . but lancet - percy have many friend . come here , take a look . max ( stutter ) what do ...do ... but then , Max notice that he thumb be twitching . marcy dawson beautiful , be not it ? you know how rare ... be you okay ? max yeah , I get to go . marcy dawson but what about ... max let I think about it ... Max trot off . marcy dawson what ? Mr. Cohen !? int . subway station - public bench - night the station be strangely silent . it be also extremely rundown . the track be rusted and fuck up . all we hear be the sound of dripping water . the sound be warpe and grow and morph until it 's downright scary . Max sit on a bench suck down pill . his head begin to hurt . he touch the right side of he scalp and nub it . as the blood surge through he head it bring he wave of pain . he gag several time . then the pain let loose and all Max want to do be die . he smashes the side of he head with he fist . across the track on the far platform he see someone . for a moment Max 's pain dissipate . his view be obscure by the column .

Max spin around . nothing be there but silence . he turn back to the gray matter . he touch it again . once again , he hear the deafen honk honk . Max spin around , but nothing be there . frustrate , he push he pen deep into the brain - fiber rip apart . suddenly , a train be barrel down on Max . second from impact , Max scream !!! dissolve to blinding white void we hear two deep , long sleep - fill breath and then we CUT to : int . subway train - day Max 's eye pop open . a transit cop be stick he with a nightstick . transit cop up , buddy coney Island , last stop .

I can not now , Jenna . jenna please , Max . max I be work now , later okay ? Max shut the door and return to the microscope . he change the magnification . at a weaker magnification , the mathematician see that the cell be group in spiral . Max be stunne , he grab the phone and pull a business card out of he pocket he quickly dial a number . someone answer with a " shalom " on the other end of the line . Max ask for lenny meyer and be put on hold . lenny meyer hello , this be lenny ? max lenny , it 's Max Cohen . lenny meyer Max ! how be you ? you want to come down ? max I have be think about we conversation earlier . Max look into the microscope . he stare at the spiral . lenny meyer that 's good ... max I want to help . lenny meyer excellent . max do you have the torah in digital form ? dissolve from turret to : satellite image of spinning tornado start in tight on the epicenter and pull out to reveal the entire storm . max ( v.o. ) Thursday , September fourth , sixteen forty - five . the alchemist awake . all of my idea , work and dream be spin together it all have to do with spiral . it begin with spiral and the answer be thee . int . max's apartment '' day euclide innard Max use a drill to rip out some old part . he lay new wire and do a bunch of solder . he rip down a bunch of old papers and do a general houseclean . he also go to school on the ant population in he apartment . he plant some ant motel and spray the room with . a pest killer . max ( v.0 . ) the most I can remember about they significance be from schneider 's class . that bullshit core for major . schneider 's fascination with mystical geometry make he a bit of a quack ... but ... then again , look at kepler . he be really into pythagoras . the leader of a ancient sect which believe the entire universe could be represent by number . pythagoras ' great contribution be the golden ratio , which end up influence art and science for thousand of year , arguably all the way up to today . tight on max write a : b : : b : a + bear he draw it over a copy of Leonardo Da vinci 's famous draw of man 's anatomy . max ( v.0 . ) the golden ratio , if I recall , be this unique relationship between the length and width of a special rectangle call the golden rectangle . tight on max carefully measure out a golden rectangle . the rectangle fit perfectly over Leonardo Da vinci 's man . max ( v.o . ) if you take the width of this rectangle and use it to form a square within the rectangle , the part leave over be a rectangle that have the same ratio as the original rectangle . au can continue squaring the rectangle , over and over again , make the rectangle smaller and smaller to infinity . tight on max squaring rectangle after rectangle . then he draw the golden spiral through the rectangle . max ( v.0 . ) then , if you connect a curve through this rectangle you get the golden spiral . the pythagorean love this shape because they find it everywhere in nature . montage of image the image mirror what Max talk about . we see nautilus shell , sunflowers , plant , ram horn , human fingerprint , the milky way , and DNA strand . max ( v.0 . ) it really be amazing . in the sea , on land , in air , we basic building block DNA and even we home . ext . chinatown - day Max wander through the crowded street of Chinatown . max ( v.o. ) if we be build from spiral , while live within a giant spiral , be it possible that all of human behavior , if it could be quantify , be in the form of a spiral . then , maybe , extension of we behavior like the stock market . maybe even the write of the torah , be infuse with the spiral pattern . dissolve to pan across new euclid we start on the stock ticker and pull out to reveal a leaner , meaner and more exciting machine . max ( v.o. ) Friday , September fifth .

( beat ) if you get it , maybe we can figure it out . ( change subject ) can you really find it ? max if the number 's in there , I will find it . ext . max's apartment - dusk Max march into he foyer when he 's suddenly ambush by devi 's boyfriend , farrouhk . farrouhk be a little guy with a big sadistic smile . he grab Max by the collar and slam he against the wall . his fist butt up against Max 's chin . farrouhk there you go , dork . be think about my girlfriend . have not you ? max wha ... farrouhk you want to fuck she , do not you ? max no , no .. farrouhk you call my girlfriend ugly !? why do not you want to fuck she ? you think she 's ugly ? max no , no , I just . it 's that she 's you girl ... farrouhk so you do want to fuck she . you think about fuck she in the mouth , do not you ? max no , no , sir , please .
