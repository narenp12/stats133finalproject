( she stop . get a hold of herself ) and because we want to pay tribute to she in a way that might conceivably not enrage she . everyone laugh slightly . emily ( cont 'd ) I do not want to tell anyone what to think , or how to feel . and I do not want to kid myself about the stupid , meaningless way she die , because it would really make she throw up . but I do not want it to become the summation of she life . because it 's not . when she Lisa die I say to she , " how can you stand it ? " and she say . " first of all I can not . but I do not want to take away the twelve year she do have , and turn they all into leukemia . because they be not . " so despite the fact that she get -- rip off , I do think it 's important to remember that monica get a lot out of life . she be the most fully develop person I personally have ever know . she be also impossible to get along with , but that 's another story . everybody laugh . emily ( cont 'd ) as most of you know , she have more than she share of trouble over the year . but that never diminish she compassion or stop she from embrace life to the absolute fullest -- measure . 71 90 continued : ( 2 ) 90 2 nd mourner she sure do . emily so. now I have say my little piece . and now I want to talk a little bit about the first time we meet . she be twenty one .

( she start cry ) I mean what the fuck be wrong with she ? woman mourner I do not know ! emily I do not understand why she do not kill herself when Lisa die ! and then Barry , and then after all that with she mother , and then she father , she get hit by a fuck bus ? it 's like a joke ! but that 's monica . always the worst luck . always . ( notice lisa ) ok , sweetheart . thank you for come . please do not stand there stare at I , ok ? lisa ( startle , embarrassed ) I be sorry !

I tell she there be no funeral , but she want to come anyway .

John be walk back and forth , read aloud from King lear . JOHN ( reading ) " we be to the god as fly to wanton boy . they kill we for they sport . " ( pause ) we be to the god as fly to wanton boy . they kill we for they sport . " what do you make of that ? Lisa ? Lisa ? lisa I do not know . JOHN take a stab . what do you think Shakespeare be say about human suffer here ? lisa I do not know . sorry . JOHN you know what , Lisa ? that 's not good enough . that 's not good enough . Shakespeare write something : what 's you response ? and do not tell I you do not have one because I do not buy it . lisa I do not really have a lot to say . it seem pretty self - evident to I . JOHN ( pause . then : ) Matthew ? matthew I think it be self -evident . I think he 's say that human being do not mean any more to the god than fly do to little boy who like to torture they for fun . ( more ) Green revise 10/7/05 - page 74 96 continued : 96 matthew ( cont 'd ) like as far as the god be concerned we be just ant . nothing . ( like a newscaster turn to he colleague ) Darren ? the class laugh . darren ( respond in kind ) thank you , Matthew . yeah , I agree . only it 's not Shakespeare say it : it 's gloucester . maybe another character would have a different point of view . JOHN ok : that 's a valid point . just because Shakespeare have one of he character say it do not mean he personally agree with it . yes : David ? david yeah , maybe Shakespeare be not say the god do not care about we . maybe he 's say there 's a higher consciousness that we can not see . that the god ' perception of reality be so much more develop than ours that compare to they perception , we perception be like compare fly to boy JOHN ok ... I do not think that 's what he 's get at ... I think what he 's get at here be a very dark view of the arbitrary nature of human suffer . david but maybe he 's not . maybe he 's compare human consciousness to divine consciousness , and he 's say that even though it seem to we that human suffer be just arbitrary , that 's just because we be limited by we viewpoint . JOHN well -- let 's look at the text . let 's test David 's hypothesis . " we be to the god as fly to wanton boy . they kill we for they sport . " I have to agree with Matthew , that seem pretty unambiguous . david yeah , because he 's say there 's a higher purpose that we can not see . he 's say that what seem like they kill we for sport could just be because we consciousness be not develop enough to see what the higher wisdom of they kill we be . 2nd Blue revise 10/28/05 - page 75 96 continued : ( 2 ) 96 JOHN ok , but -- I still do not think that 's what he 's try to say . um ... david no , like if you say they kill we for they sport , when we perception of the god be so meager that we can not even tell what they be do , then how can we be so arrogant as to think that they would bother to kill we for they sport ? JOHN ( lost ) I do not know ... um -- monica ? monica I do not think that 's what he 's say at all . I think he 's say the god do not give a shit about human being and they just kill and torture we for fun -- matthew yes . much like fly to wanton boy . anybody ? anybody ? monica yeah ... 1 david but if the god ' consciousness be so much more develop than ours that we seem like fly to they , then how can we be sure what they have in mind for we or why they do anything ? JOHN David , I think you have make you point . but it 's not what Shakespeare mean . scholarly opinion be pretty consistent that he 's try to say something about human suffer here -- david scholarly opinion ...: JOHN and in this particular play what I think he 's try to say be pretty black -- pretty bleak -- david but what be you say ? a thousand frenchmen can not be wrong ? 2nd Blue revise 10/28/05 - page 76 96 continued : ( 3 ) 96 JOHN no , I be not say that . but I would like to move on -- david I think he be say that , because he 's compare human consciousness to fly , and he 's say that we can not see the truth around we because we consciousness be undevelop . JOHN no David , that 's not what Shakespeare mean ! he say it somewhere else in the play , but I do not want to get hang up on this any more because it 's not what Shakespeare mean , and I would really like to move on . David laugh derisively . 97 omit 97 98 int . lisa' room . night / karl house . dusk . 98 Lisa be on the phone with Karl . we CUT between they . lisa hi dad . karl yeah ! hi ! how 's everything be go ? lisa ok . how be you ? karl not too bad . pretty good .

I think I might have spill the bean on that one a little -- karl that 's ok . because now , if now you stop acknowledge he , you just suddenly give he nothing , he 's gonna go berserk . unless he 's just not interested . in which case , you gotta take you lump . ok ? which be tough . lisa well , thanks , dad . I will be sure to try out the technique next time I see he . karl yeah . lemme know what happen . lisa 78 98 continued : ( 3 ) 98 karl ok . well , everything 's ok here ... a little slow -- lisa actually , dad ?
