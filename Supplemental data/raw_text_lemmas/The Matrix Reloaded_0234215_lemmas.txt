T h E m a T R I X R E L o a D E D written by Andy and Larry wachowski April 8 , 1999 fade in on : Dark cloud below the inky remnant of the scorched sky . we hear wind as we sail , like a glider , over the black atmosphere . we dive down into the murkiness , through the cloud , into the darker world of the dead surface of Earth , the desert of the real . the rotted skeleton of a massive city be sprawle everywhere . we approach a fissure in the Earth 's crust , and as we do , we hear the increase buzz of multiple hovercraft engine . Blue flash grow in intensity from the fissure . Radio voice , indistinct at first , grow louder as we approach the fissure . woman ( v.o . ) " six o'clock , 300 meter . we can not outrun them . " man ( v.o . ) " I know . can not tow this crate fast enough ! we gotta ditch it ! " we hear the voice as though we be listen to cop through a police scanner . the woman be niobe , the captain of the lead ship , sephora . niobe ( v.o . ) " can not , the core be still good . and they have get ' the one . ' " man ( v.o . ) " oooh , we savior . hed better be worth it . " niobe ( v.o . ) " shut up and make the exit . hold on ! " the azure glow from the fissure be suddenly overwhelming . a tight convoy of three hovercraft explode from the fissure , travel nearly straight up , like a trio of massive locomotive fly into the sky in tight formation , link together by tow cable . the blue glow have be emanate from the overworked flare drive of the first and third hovercraft . between they , suspend by tow cable , be the dark , scorched , and slice nebachanezzer . they rocket upward , slow as they reach the top of the arc . niobe ( v.o . ) " woo-hoooh ! " the rush to the ground , pull up at the last second . the neb flail wildly between they . man ( v.o . ) " they be still on we ! " more vehicle fly from the fissure . a massive army of squiddie pour up onto the surface . int . nebachanezzer cockpit the neb be sling between the two hovercraft , with the cockpit face backwards . trinity , morpheus , tank , and neo , the former Thomas Anderson , crowd the cockpit . helpless , the landscape speed away from they , while a wall of red-ey squiddie speed to they . it 's be a mere two day since the realization of neous power and the defeat of agent smith . the slipstream whistle violently into the interior of the ship , and the crew be cold , tired , haggard , and stress beyond belief as they can only watch the action in they knock - out ship . morpheus be on a headset . morpheus " niobe , theyre close . " niobe " how many ? " morpheus " just a few . maybe two or three . hundre . " int . sephora cockpit niobe , as regal as she be beautiful , sit at the control of she ship with she co-pilot , a young female . all visible dial be redlined as they streak over the dark surface . niobe " you ve get a gift for understatement . " int . freedom cockpit the freedomus captain , a silhouette in a dark cockpit , be fly blind . his cockpit be awash in the blue flare from niobes ship . his lieutenant , a shadowy female figure , reach for the radar screen . as she do , we see she bare shoulder fall into view , a white rabbit tattoo be conspicuous . they switch they screen to the radar , squiddy right on they ass . man " oh shit , were screw . we gotta set down and emp em . " niobe ( v.o . ) " too many ! " ext . freedom hull a racing squiddie reach the hull and latch on , strike up its cut laser and rip into the hull . int . sephora cockpit man ( v.o. ) " theyre on I ! shit! lose power ! " niobes Lieutenant , a muscular asian woman , circa , note something on a console . circa " multiple bogy close ! " niobe " no shit . " circa " from the front ! " niobe be grim face as she peer into the sky ahead . several object be close in fast . circa " be they - " she do not have time to finish the question , as the oncoming fighter launch a massive volley of missile . from afar , they look like dark irise surround by a corona of flame . at first , we can not tell exactly what they be , until they fiery trail rip straight at the sephora cockpit . circa duck as the missile harmlessly streak by . int . neb cockpit a massive swarm off missile blast by the cockpit . the individual warhead swerve at the last second , blow squiddie apart , or casting they to the ground aflame . int . sephora cockpit niobe breathes a sigh of relief . her lieutenant look back up to see a wing of hover fighter - ' defender ' fly past they ship . sleek , with huge blue flare from they engine , they be gunship fighter armed to the tooth with missile and laser turret studd the fuselage . niobe " they be ours . " defender one ( v.o . ) " hold on , folk , you be in for a little clean . " ext . the surface the wing of defender make short work of the squiddy . the half dozen cling to freedom be hull be pick off by well - place laser shot that turn the squiddy into curdle ball of slag . the squiddy that survive turn tail and run . int . neb cockpit the crew of the neb breathe a collective sigh of relief as they leave the scene of aerial carnage behind they . neo have be grip a oh-shit handle on the edge of the cockpit . he relax he grip as they escape be clear . they ship suddenly enter a cave , and start to descend . the blue wash of the ship show rock wall and pipe . the ship be slow down as they descend back into the earth . tank be shoulder drop , and he lean back into he chair . tank " we be home . " trinity " well , not yet , but we be in the defense screen . " neo " what 's that ? " morpheus " a concentric ring of defense that shield Zion . the fighter that just save we constitute the first ring . " niobe ( v.o . ) " neb crew , you can relax now . " morpheus " for the moment , perhaps . its still a long drive home . " fade out and fade into : trinity's cabin . at first we see only star twinkle , faraway diamond on a black velvet background . the camera descend through the darkness , to a sunset , dark blue , as if just after sunset . the artwork terminate in the metal ring go around she room . it 's a much more hospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft . the article she 's collect during she time in the resistance dot the cabin . a unfinish sweatshirt sit on a loom . there be charcoal portrait of love one . softly light , the cabin sway slightly . the neb be still in tow . neo be sit against the wall on trin 's bed , with she curl up beside he with she head on he lap . Neo can nt sleep . he stare at the wall opposite he . there 's a photo of the crew of the neb , san trin , in better day . smiling , laugh as they be seat around the table . morpeus , tank , dozer , switch , epoch , mouse . Neo stop on the image of a smile cypher . there 's a unknown asian man in the photo , look withdraw and a bit lonely . gently , place trinity 's head down , neo stand and examine the photo . she awaken . trinity " I will have to take that one down now . cypher ... " neo " who be this guy ? " trinity " who ? " neo point to the mystery man . trinity " that be ... I ... forget he name . " neo " what happen to he ? " trinity be sullen . " he do nt make it . " neo return to the bed and sit down , disturb . trinity sit up , awaken . neo " be he like I ? " trinity nod . trinity " not you , though . like you . there have be other , Neo . " " be not you tired ? " neo " no . I have never be a big sleeper . " trinity " I know . I use to watch you hack without sleep for day . " he turn to she , question in he eye . neo " how many ' one ' have there be ? " trinity " that 's not the point . " neo may not think so . trinity " you be he . youre mine . " neo " but what do it mean , to be the one ? " trinity " I do not know , Neo . we mission be to find you . " neo " so , now what ? " trinity " now , Zion will give we a new mission . " the hatch swing open . morpheus peer in . morpheus " we be almost home . we will need a detail . five minute . " he close the hatch and disappear . neo " do he ever knock ? " trinity " not on he ship . " CUT to : int . MAIN deck , neb the crew grip the bulkhead and fixture as the sway ship come to a rest . outside , the sound of hover engine fade away . tank unlock the main hatch , then jump as it drop , unpower , slamm into the tarmac with a resounding smash . CUT to : ext . zion tarmac the tarmac be a busy , crowded military airport , with hovercraft of different size spread across the lot . its house poorly light , house in a cave so huge the ceiling be out of site . crewperson run around , service battle - damage vehicle . munition be carte across the tarmac on robot roll rack . no one pay the neb and its batter crew any mind . nearby , the sephora and freedom be park . they engine shut down , and they power hatches be open . the crewmember be spilling out . niobe hurry to morpheus ' side , and he step toward she , smile , but they military manner be quickly restore , though they can barely contain they grin . morpheus " niobe ... " she shake he hand , the shake slow down . " M. " morpheus " thanks for the rescue . " they close for a kiss , when the freedom be captain suddenly jump between they . it 's choi - the neo 's suppose neighbor and hack financier . exhuberant and oblivious , he joyfully get in morpheus ' face . choi " brough , you we you ass ! we save you so hard core you do not even know ! " niobe smile at morpheus and fade back as booth shout he own praise . morpheus turn to he less - mature peer . choi " so , you think you finally find the one , huh ? another one ? " dujour , choi' lieutenant , push into they conversation , look offscreen . dujour " idiot , we help he find he . hello , morpheus . " choi " huh ? " he look at what she 's see . his gaze halt on neo . he 's concentrate on tank and he apparent girlfriend , who seem to be consol he . he turn to see choi and dujour , do a double - take , and he jaw drop open . neo " you ? " choi be quick to resume he cool . choi " in the flesh , so to speak . " dujour " welcome to the real world , Neo . I be glad you be here . " choi " what do you think , dujour ? should we take he with we ? " dujour " definitely . " choi " morpheus ? " morpheus turn from niobe and a Zion officer . he address trinity , glance at the other . morpheus " go on ship 's liberty . meet I in the Dead duck at 21:00 hour , drunk or sober . " ext . zion STREET it 's like a valley floor run between two gigantic wall of rock that be nearly vertical , come together in a elongate archway . carve into the street level be innumerable store and shop , above they , apartment and balcony that rise to the top of the arch . people flow through the street . they clothes be homespun wool , denim , and leather . dy and color be absent . carve into the solid granite wall , between home and around window and door , be intricate and beautiful carving . neo be lead down the street by choi , dujour , and trinity , and a few other rebel . the push through a mult - culti crowd of people , humanity melting into one race . choi " see , man ? this be home . this be the main street . one of em , anyway . almost everyone be a fighter . sometimes , even the kid . they pass a outdoor workshop where youngster be assemble small machine . choi " we energy as a people be direct toward liberation . check it out , here be some newcomer . " a group of frail , buzz - cut androgonite pass by they . they look at neo , recognize he as one of they , a new comer . neo " where do they come from ? " choi " Energy plant we raid on we last mission . there be some survivor . " neo " how be they mind freed from the matrix ? " trinity " with difficulty . " dujour " if at all . " they step into a club , Dead duck . it 's a sailor joint . lot of wood , beer on tap , and rum . crewmember of other ship recognize the rebel , greeting they , as they eye Neo . they take a booth in the corner . the waitress arrive . waitress " welcome home , brother and sister . first day back ? " choi " yes , lovely . " waitress " on the house , then . four rum ? " trinity " make it eight . " the waitress smirk and leave . trinity turn to choi . trinity " any casualty ? " choi light up and take a drag . choi " two . sidewinder and left-right . " dujour " I can nt believe cypher turn . bastard . " choi " he who lose faith ... " dujour " Neo , we monitor you fight . do you really gain enlightenment ? " neo shrug . neo " all I know be I kick smiths ass . " choi " fuckin finally , Jesus Christ . it 's about time we iced that bastard . " dujour " yeah , we finally win against a agent ? " choi " I guess 1 n 298 be nt a bed record , huh ? " the drink arrive . tall glass of rum . choi hold he glass aloft . they raise they glass to toast . choi " live free or die . " all ( save neo ) " live free . " they slam the rum back , and slam empty glass on the table . neo can barely manage to sip he . neo " God , how do you do that ? " trinity " you ve never drank before . " dujour " not for real . " choi " you want to know what be the one mean ? " neo " what ? " choi " one drink and youre toast . " dujour " Neo , you know what else youve never do ? " she glance at trinity , who fall back against the seat , turn to suppress a smile . choi crack up . neo " yeah . " dujour " yeah , you ve never do it . " choi " and virtual do nt count , man , do nt fuck count . " neo " well . I ll drink to that . " choi " here , here . " this time , neo follow the other and slam back the entire glass . he cough and sputter as he friend and bar patron cheer he on . " ext . MAIN STREET , zion the light be dim , and only a few late night reveler stagger through the street on they way back home . walk straight and calmly through the straggler be morpheus and niobe . morpheus " so , how do you like have you own command ? " niobe " it 's good . but try . the responsibility ... " they stop before the entrance to the dead duck . morpheus " you must be both mother and father to you crew . " niobe nod , and look into the bar . Inside , the crew be raging drunk and loud . niobe " who will you be now ? the mother , or the father ? " morpheus peer in on the scene and grin . morpheus " as long as they do nt get out of line , I ll just be a brother . " int . dead duck neo be out of it , while the other be merely comfortably in the bag . he 's act like a kid who break into he fatherus liquor cabinet . choi " so , you go back in , and you two pull he out ? " trinity nod , herself in disbelief . neo pick he head up off the table . neo " kicked ... kick smiths ass . " choi eye morphes and niobe come toward they . choi " hey , do you kick anybody elseus ass , Neo ? like morpheus ? " neo " morpheus ? yeah , I smack he around , too . " morpheus arrive just in time to hear the last part . he stand and grin down at neo . morpheus " so , you can smack I around , Neo ? " neo " oh yeah . anytime . " morpheus tap he on the forehead . neo blink and fall back into the booth . he stand before they . trinity " how's tank ? " morpheus " hes on bereavement leave with he mother . dozer be the second son sheus lose in this war . " his comment set a sober tone . morpheus " the nebechanezzer be out of commission for at least a month . but , that 's not give we a rest . " trinity " let I guess . we ve be order back out anyway . " morpheus " yes . this be another special op . I m in command , niobe and trinity be team leader . Neo be we secret weapon . " flash to : neo , pass out with he mouth open on the couch . morpheus " we do nt know exactly what heus capable of . he may be just tapping he potential , or he may have already reach it . we be to learn from he , as he do from we . " choi " why be we always get screw ? not only do I have to go straight back into the shit , but I lose my command , too ? " morpheus " youve be assign to this mission because youre the best , choi . " dujour " yeah , and headquarters think you might be able to whine the agent to death . " choi " oh my God that 's so funny . my point be , do nt we need some r-and -r ? unwind a little ? we lose two crew on the last one , you lose like five , right ? shit . I m glad we find Mr. invincible , here , but Jesus ... " morpheus " you do nt have to go , choi. volunteer only . " trinity " hes get a point , M. I have faith , but why so quick ? " morpheus " we have a chance , here , but the window of opportunity be brief . we ship say the matrix be already upgrade and re-code to block we entry . and neous . " choi " fuck . every fuck time we get another one , '' this be what they do . " morpheus " he be the one . " dujour " you have nt lose the faith , have you choi ? " choi grab a half - fill rum glass and swig it down . choi " well , this be the time that try menus soul . here 's to victory . " ext . tunnel the freedom hover slowly , silently , like a submarine as it cruise through the murky depth . it suddenly come to a quiet stop , and descend . the engine fade out , and the vessel rest , darken , on the cave . a quartet of squiddie slip by . we follow as they worm they way through the twisted passageway , watch as they pass the bubble cockpit by mere foot . freeze on the cockpit . within the shadow we see morpheus and choi at the control . int . freedom cockpit they watch the squiddie fade into the distance . morpheus " power up . sleep mode . " choi " aye aye , capitano . " minimal cockpit display turn on , and the cabin remain dark . int . MAIN deck the shipus operator , a lean asian kid with a gaze like a laser scan , sit behind neo , who' sit at the operatork console with he hand on the abbreviate keyboard . trinity sit with they , she foot up as she observe . neo stare at the screen . it 's a huge syllabus of matrix code character . he struggle to learn the complex code . neo " ka equal 9 . but reverse ka be point-nine , right ? razor nod . razor " you catch on quick , man . " neo " I know this symbol from the hack trainer . but how come it 's so hard to find they on the keyboard ? " trinity " you brain know what to do . but it have to associate character with you body . " razor " it 's muscle memory , Neo . think of the space bar and you thumb nail it . because you thumb have hit the space bar million of time . but think about reverse ka , '' and you finger do nt hit automatically hit the reverse key and the ka key in one shot . " neo " where do this symbol come from , anyway ? " razor " most of it be from the old japanese . it 's katakana . see , the machine be nt binary . no zero and one . theyre quantum -base , so instead of a open-close base of zero or one , open or close , they use all number between zero and one . " neo " all number between zero and one . that could be a infinite number of number . " razor " not could be , it be . " neo be astound . neo " Holy shit . how many calculation per second ? " razor " how many cps ? well , that 's kind of hard to estimate . put it this way : picture all the particle in the know universe . not just atom , but sub-atomic particle that compose atom . " neo " ok . at last count that be what , a gazillion , right ? two gazillion ? " razor barely smile at the joke . razor " well , it 's up there . in any case , the number of calculation per second the matrix can perform be great than the estimate number of particle in the know universe . " neo " woah . " trinity " that 's how they have the operate power to create entire world within they pcs . " neo " ok . that 's why it look like reality . they have the computing power to create entire world . " razor " right . " neo " so , if we hack into the matrix , why can nt we just change the code while were at it ? " razor " no , no . see , it 's not that simple . the machine , the program that code , create , and maintain the matrix , the agent , they be code . there be different type of agent , many work unseen with no interaction in the matrix . then , there be the enforcer , the one we know all too well . " neo " right . " razor " well , my point be , the machine code and recode the matrix by pure will . interaction with the matrix , the physical act of be there , by default , allow people to change they environment - the matrix . they move object , make sound , affect cause . " neo " like reality . " trinity " almost . reality be unalterable . but the fabric of reality in the matrix can be rewoven . some can reach beyond normal cause . they affect on the matrix be deeper than average . they have learn to change it accord to they need . but they do nt have total control . that 's why we need operator like razor here . but you , you go further than any of we can . " neo " how ? " razor stand and tap neous skull . he stretch , grab a japanese style wooden sword , and , out of boredom , start perform slow , precise kendo move around the main deck as he talk . razor " the equipment you carry up here . youre a freak . a good freak . youre neural kinetics blast past that of average human . this , combine with you ability to suspend disbelief , allow you to change the reality of the matrix . " neo " how do I end up as ... a freak ? " razor practice the same strike a few time . razor " good question . the machine create people through cloning , since , obviously , no coppertop have physical sex . theoretically , all clone in the matrix be exactly the same as when the first clone . they should nt be any different from normal , homegrown . " neo " ok , so how do you explain I ? " trinity " not just you . morpheus , myself . we be all bear inside . neo " well , what separate we from other ? " trinity " for the past 50 year or so , something have be happen to child in the matrix . they ve be mutate , change in way the machine never predict . some seem to gain faster reflex and strength . other seem to have psychic power . " razor look up to see morpheus , hang back as he listen . he come forward . morpheus " and other be able to change the reality of the matrix itself . " he point to Neo . morpheus " discuss history , be we ? " razor shake he head . razor " I m try to teach this fool some programming , man . he 's stick in the 20^th century . he 's get no skill , man . without we , he 's helpless . " morpheus " in the matrix , without he , were helpless . " trinity " morpheus , can you tell we what the mission be now ? " morpheus " not until we reach broadcast depth . it 's slow go out there . I guess they know were come back , so theyre patrol . we have time to rest and ready . " ext . mountain top , late day ( construct ) trinity sit alone on the tip of a impossibly high finger of rock . it look like it sit on the rooftop of the world . all around she , as far as the eye can see , lie mountain . they snow - cap peak be pink in the sunset light . she look into the sunset . heavy thought weigh on she mind . a hand appear on she shoulder . it 's neo . how he get on the finger of rock be anyoney guess . neo " boo . " trinity grin slightly and pull on he arm . there be only enough room for one on the end of the rock , so he sit down behind she . trinity " do nt lose you balance . " neo " it do nt matter if I do . " trinity " so , you can fly . " neo " yes . " trinity " do you think I can ? " neo " I think you can do anything you want , if you believe . " trinity " like you ? " neo " I do nt know . I do nt know exactly what I can do . " trinity half turn . trinity " will you teach I to fly ? " neo " I do nt know if I can . " trinity " free you mind of doubt . " neo stand , and step in front of trinity . hes on the very , very edge of the rock . he extend he hand down to she . she grab it , and he haul she up . her eye dart to the ground , thousand of foot below the finger . trinity " in this construct program , the ground can kill . " neo " I will nt let you fall . ever . " they look into each otherus eye . despite the trauma they ve be through , and not even truly know one another , there 's a connection . neo suddenly back away . he walk on the air with perfect traction , as though heus on a invisible plane of glass . he leave trinity stand precariously on the edge , wobble a bit as she maintain balance against nerve . she breathes deep , and look back up at neo , maintain she cool even as she eye the spectacle . neo stand a few foot away from she , completely at ease as the high altitude wind ruffle he hair . neo extend a hand to she . neo " it 's not real , trinity . youre not stand there . step out . I can do it . you can , too . " with one last glance at the infinite drop , she steady herself and stare straight into he eye . Blue meet brown . breathless , she step straight out . she take one step in the air . for a breathless second , as she step off the edge , she be stable . when she take she foot off the edge , though , she sway , and she foot slip , as though sheus on a greasy surface bob up and down . she correct herself , try another step , sag further . trinity " shit . " she glance down , then lock eye with neo . then drop like a anvil . neo " whoops . " he dive down , shoot like a missile . trinity be calm , fall backwards , watch neo come for she . the rocky ground loom behind she . she make no effort to reach for neo as he draw close to she . he reach for she with all he might . neo " grab I ! " trinity make no effort to save herself , even as collision be second away . she stare at he intently . neo " grab on to I ! " seeing she be do nothing , he go beneath she and scoops she up , superman style . he barely accomplish this before he slow and settles onto the rocky ground . they be in a twilight glade shade by the mountain . neo " what the hell be you do ? " trinity smile slightly . her madness have a purpose . trinity " show you , Neo . " neo " show I what ? you nearly give I a heart attack . " trinity " I want you to know how much faith I have in you . " neo " oh . and this require act of insanity ? " trinity smile . she look he up and down . she move intimately close . " so , you really be superman . " neo " only when I m plugge in . " trinity step away . neo grab she shoulder and turn she to he . he attempt a kiss , but she turn she face , let it land on she cheek . neo " what ? " trinity look at he , then up at the sky . trinity " it 's not you . just , not here . " neo do nt understand . trinity roll she eye . trinity " theyre watch we , you big dope . do you know how horny computer geek get ? " int . MAIN bridge choi , razor , dujour , and circa be sit around the operatork console , foot up , eat . on the screen be patchy image of trinity and neo stand together in the glade . it 's like theyre watch a soap opera . trinity and neo be look in they direction . on the interface chair , the body of trinity and neo lay supine . ext . glade ( construct ) trinity grab neo by the arm . trinity " over here . " she lead he into the shadow . int . MAIN bridge the voyeuristic crewmember collectively groan as the lover disappear off the screen and into the darkness . razor put he hand on circa S shoulder and sigh . razor " so romantic .

" agent brown " as be the loss of we colleague . " they be both seethe with anger . agent jone grind he molar . jone " we can nt defeat they . you see what happen . " jone " we have a backup copy of agent Smith ... " jone stand and walk toward the massive panoramic window . the city spread before he . jone " a backup be not good enough . we need to upgrade ourselves to meet the new threat . " brown open a large file folder . brown " he 's be rebuilt . but I have a alternate plan . why fight the human , when we can let they fight for we ? " jone " the terrorist have learn to bend we reality in way we cannot . this be the cause of we defeat . " brown " Mr. Thomas J. Anderson be not unique . over the decade , many human have develop ... technique for manipulate the matrix . techniques too primitive for we to understand . most never realize they potential , but all the one weve notice exhibit this talent be record here . " angle on the book as brown flip through . Street shot of people from all walk of life . Young rebel , corporate suit , junky , housewive . jone turn on agent brown . jone " do you have anyone in mind ? " angle on the book . it stop on a page dedicated to someone who look like neo , but with long hair and a extremely bad attitude . there be photo of he on a motorcycle with a blonde , photo of he drink with he gang friend . brown " Gregory lowfield . he exhibit the trait we see in Mr. Anderson . " manq voice ( o.s. ) " Mr. Anderson no longer exist . we enemy now be the one call ... neo . " angle on : the door agent smith walk in , grin . there be a new swag to he walk , and he hair be longer , tie back . brown " you ve be recreate . " smith flexe he arm , examine he hand , and feel he hair . jone " and you have more hair . " smith turn to he , examine the photo on the table . they lock eye . on the same wavelength , they transfer knowledge without speak . smith look at the photo on the table . smith " I know what youre think . what we need be we own Neo ... " jone " if it 's possible . " smith " I ll make it possible . " we zoom in on the grainy photo of neo 's doppledanger . quiet at first , grow louder as it grow dark , we here the rumble and roar of motorcycle . ext . desert highway ( night ) far off in the distance , the glow of motorcycle headlight racing toward we . as we zoom out and focus in , they be already too close to avoid . they rip by we , thunder explosion and man and woman cheer . the pack of about ten biker and they woman do nt wear helmet . they fly down the highway use both lane , drink and drive with total abandon . angle on the lead motorcycle , a massive , custom - make harley . gregory lowfield , Thomas J. Anderson without a desk job , without care , revs he bike and lock the accelerator . he hand he beer to the blonde who ride behind he , then , in one swift motion , jump up on he seat , lean into the slipstream . the feat be impossible . he girlfriend , chandra , scream at he as she grasp the seat and lower herself to the bike . chandra " greg , be you fuck crazy ? " greg " yes . but do nt worry . " she cling to he leg as they barrel down the highway . they blast pass a darken cruiser . int . cruiser the cop set he paper down just long enough to catch a glimpse of the pack explode down the highway , with gregory surfing he bike . angle on : the radar gun . it 's flash 125 mph cop " Holy shit . drunk ass punk . " ext . highway gregory be face we as he drop back into he seat , take he beer on cue from chandra . behind they , the copus light flare up . gregory " oh boy . stop , stop , letus have some fun . " int . cop car we look through the windshield as the cop drive down the highway , call in he stop-vehicle report . he suddenly see something that make he slam on the brake . cop " Holy shit ! " angle through the copus windshield . the ten biker , with gregory at they center , be park in the middle of the road , look at he casually .
