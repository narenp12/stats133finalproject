( to shcherbina ) when the rbmk run at low power , as it be that night , it 's notoriously unstable . prone to -- swing -- in reactivity . under normal circumstance , control rod can compensate for that . khomyuk under normal circumstance . ( she report ) the Chernobyl staff stall the reactor during the test . they pull almost all of the control rod to bring the power back up . 50 . legasov this be what volkov learn from leningrad . if the boron rod be completely withdraw from the core , when they be put back in , the first thing into the reactor be not boron . ( beat ) it 's graphite . the boron control rod have graphite tip that displace water and steam . reactivity do not go down . it go up . dramatically . khomyuk lean back . in shock . but shcherbina can only stand there dumbly , wait for a explanation . legasov imagine there 's a fire in a building . you turn on a hose , but instead of water come out , it spray petrol instead . shcherbina then why in god 's name do they push that button ? khomyuk ( finally understand ) they do not know . and now shcherbina take another chair and sit . my god ... yes . legasov volkov warn the kremlin ten year ago . but there must be no doubt about the supremacy of the Soviet nuclear industry . shcherbina ( realize ) the kgb classified it as a state secret . legasov when I see the reactor blow open , I still do not think it could be this flaw in az - 5 ... because the flaw will not lead to a explosion unless the operator have first willfully push the reactor to the edge of disaster . 51 . shcherbina so it be they fault . legasov yes. khomyuk but not only they fault . legasov no. khomyuk and be that what you be go to say ? in Vienna ? valery , you have to tell the truth . all of it . shcherbina you can not possibly be that naive . khomyuk there be 16 rbmk reactor run right now in the Soviet Union . we have to fix they , and the only way to make that happen be to go public . in Vienna , in the West , and force the Central Committee to take action . shcherbina what you be propose be that legasov humiliate a nation that be obsessed with not be humiliate . shcherbina swallow he anger . then , to legasov : shcherbina we can make a deal with the kgb . you leave this information out in Vienna , and they quietly allow we to fix the remain reactor . khomyuk a deal . with the kgb . and I be naive ... legasov do not know how to respond . caught between the two of they . between he heart and he mind . shcherbina valery , they will go after you friend , you family -- 52 . khomyuk you have a chance to talk to the world . if it be I -- shcherbina but it be not , be it . I have be a part of this system for 44 year , so listen carefully . I have know brave soul than you , khomyuk . Men who have they moment and do nothing , because when it be you life and the life of everyone you love , you moral conviction do not mean a damn thing . it leave you . and all you want in that moment be not to be shot . a few second . then she turn calmly to legasov . khomyuk do you know the name vasily ignatenko ? legasov shake he head no . khomyuk he be a fireman . he die two week after the accident . I have be look in on he widow . she give birth today . a girl . ( beat ) the baby live four hour . she have 28 roentgen . they say the radiation would have kill the mother , but the baby absorb it instead . her baby . ( quietly ) we live in a country where child have to die to save they mother . the hell with we name and the hell with you deal . someone have to start tell the truth . legasov look at they . khomyuk , who be right . and shcherbina ... who be also right . and only he can decide . tarakanov ( v.o. ) congratulation , comrade . 467 ext . masha - day 467 completely clean of debris . two man emerge onto the roof . one carry a metal pole . the other have a cylindrical case strapped to he back . 468 469 470 53. tarakanov ( v.o. ) you be the last of 3,828 man . ext . reactor site - continuous 468 tarakanov address a group of eight soldier , still in they heavy gear , but not wear glove or mask . tarakanov you have perform you duty perfectly . I wish you good health and long life . all of you be award with a bonus of 800 ruble . tarakanov approach the first soldier . shake he hand . tarakanov thank you . soldier # 1 I serve the Soviet Union . tarakanov move to the second soldier . shake he hand . tarakanov thank you . soldier # 2 I serve the Soviet Union . ext . very top of the cooling tower - continuous 469 the two man attach a pole and red flag to the top of the tower . it flap in the wind . tarakanov ( v.o. ) thank you . soldier # 3 ( v.o. ) I serve the Soviet Union . ext . liquidator camp - same 470 from here , we can see the reactor site in the near distance . and the red flag flutter on the cool tower . pavel - stand in place , gaze out at it . he 's gaunt . sallow skin . his hair seem thin . numb . blank stare . he 's smoking now . 471 54 . a young recruit , 21 , fresh - face believer , walk up to pavel , and join he look out at the flag . recruit make you proud , do not it , comrade ? pavel do not look at he . just keep stare out . recruit they send I over to you . for assignment . ( he radiation badge ) they give I this to wear . I guess everyone have one . we do not have anything to worry about , right ? pavel still do not look at he . but : pavel you can get up to 24 roentgen before there 's a problem . recruit oh . how much do you have ? pavel keep he eye lock on the flag . take a long drag on he cigarette . then : pavel 23 . dissolve to : int . hospital - day 471 the maternity ward . New mother pass in front of we . some walk , some be wheeled . cradle they newborn . but we move through they like we be not there . like we be a ghost . until we find a open door ... and stop . in a bare room , lyudmilla sit on the edge of the bed , still in a hospital gown , look out the window . forgotten . and alone . she put she hand to she belly , and : fade to black end of episode four
