Alpha zeroe in on a poacher attempt to scoop up a young chimp . he streak across the clear , knock the poacher from he mount . Alpha pound he chest , let out a battle cry -- try to rally a counter - attack . but the other chimp pay no heed . there 's no organization to the defense . it 's chaos . shot ring out . the chimp maul the poacher drop , one by one . other take off . 2 .
