( aerial ) angle from int . police helicopter ( over bank ) as it bank steeply we can see past Pilot to bank , and cop around car . we see a small crowd be hold back by a few police still set up barricade . it be the first indication of the crowd event it become . it also set the geography for we , but very quickly another copter swim into view and the two circle each other . the other copter -- only foot away -- be a tv news helicopter , with a big camera stick out the open door on we side . it be turn down by the cameraman to focus on the bank . a cop in the police helicopter yell through he bullhorn at the tv cameraman . bullhorn cop this be a restrict area . you be fly in a restrict area ... the tv cameraman swivel he camera up to focus on the cop , and as the lens hit we dead center ... int . apartment near bank though a open window a fire escape can be see and beyond it a angle of street and the bank . near the window in a corner be a tv set , and on the tv set we be see the shot of the police helicopter and the cop yell on the bullhorn as see from the tv copter . a couple of elderly Men be sit watch the tv set , ignore the bank , which they can see in the flesh , as it be . outside we be hearing the copter , and on the tv set likewise , and the voice of the announcer . announcer ( v.o. ) ... police as yet have make no contact with the bank robber who be lock in the bank ... there be a hammering at the door , and the man at the tv set barely have time to look around before several burly cop wear flak vest and helmet and carry sniper rifle with telescopic slight move through the room , ignore the man . they move out onto the fire escape , a couple go up higher , settling themselves down to aim in they rifle on the front of the bank . a lot of ad lib dialogue , but what we note be the cop , as a man , take a look at themselves on the tv . ext . bank - day the frame be full of cop face ... tough , mesomorphic face with a layer of fat under the skin , increase as age . they have the look of cop : alert , curious , weigh . they be city cop ; they do not have that old - fashioned condemnatory expression , there be a element of playfulness in they nature -- the fact be they love they work , which be criminal . there be a peculiar delight in ferrete out the criminal impulse in everybody , and a match fury in punish it -- which be the action of repress they own strongly develop criminal unconscious . this be tense , funny , violent , and rigidly control man . moretti be a old - line cop , a lot more relaxed than the young man and the cold professional of the FBI , who as a group resemble astronaut , and like they hide ( but do not deny ) the psychic chaos underneath . right now they be look at the sky . we hear a heavy helicopter track . we feature sheldon , the silver - haire FBI agent-in - charge , who look like a accountant , and Moretti , with hat and cigar , and a face out of Warner Brothers movie of the Forties . in spite of sheldon 's age , Moretti play though he 's a smart kid who still need a little help . sheldon be get out of a gray car , wear a gray suit .
