Jackson 's first film , bad taste 1988 ) , be make by the director over a period of several year while he be work as a photo apprentice at a local newspaper . Jackson 's two follow film , meet the feebles ( 1990 ) and braindead ( 1992 ) , be co-written with walsh and Stephen sinclair ; the latter be a hit on the film festival circuit , win 16 international prize include a best picture award from the Academy of fantasy , Science fiction and horror . Jackson and walsh ( who have previously write for episodic television in New Zealand ) co-authore the screenplay for heavenly creature , which go on to garner nomination for both a Academy Award and a writer Guild Award . they latest collaboration be the frightener , executive - produce by Robert Zemeckis and star Michael J. Fox ; it will be release in 1996 . Jackson and walsh live in Wellington with they son , billy . the version of heavenly creature publish here be a final draft , complete in March 1993 . the screenplay be 107 page long . Fran , my understanding be that you be the first to become interested in the parker / hulme murder case as a film subject . it seem to be a popular topic in New Zealand . france walsh : well , popular topic - I be not sure about that . but it 's certainly a piece of New Zealand criminal history that have enter into the realm of myth . and as a young girl grow up , I know about it , and have read lurid newspaper account - " lesbian killer ' rampage " ? fw : yes , yes . and I also get my hand on a novel call obsession , which I read when I be about 14 . I think at the time that it be extremely good . [ laugh ] it take a very damn view of the girl - it 's write by two English journalist who come out here to cover the trial . it be something of a hack job that set out to sensationalize the case . and there be also a play , be not there ? fw : yeah , there 's be a play , and there have be nonfiction book write about it . there 's also be a great deal of coverage over the year in newspaper and magazine , so it 's always have a profile here . since it have already be treat in all of this different way , what compel you both to explore the subject again ? Peter Jackson : well , we do not really think it have be treat that well . nothing that we have read do we particularly like . and also , the other various treatment all seem to have a specific agenda , which attempt to make political statement about the murder . what interested we be to show this two 15 - year- old girl with no other agenda than to be as accurate as we possibly could , and to somehow imagine what be go on inside they mind . I know that all of pauline 's voiceover from the film be from actual diary entry . you make a interesting comment awhile back about how they actually inform the structure of the film . could you elaborate on that ? pj : well , the structure be fairly apparent once we start to do research . it be not just the diary themselves , it be the general research . we read as much of the diary as we could - we have not actually ever see the full , unedite diary - but we gather as many of the excerpt that be releasedat the time of the trial as we could , which amount to quite a few page . and we read the newspaper , and interview people , and then the three act sort of materialize quite neatly . you know , act one be when the two girl meet and become friend , and the turn point be at the end of the first act when you realize that they be now bond . fw : it 's when they have they first delusional experience together at Port levy , where they go into the fourth World . you know this two girl have a imagination that 's go to lead to something interesting happen . the second turn point come with the decision to murder mother , which tip the story into the third act . whom do you interview to cull together all of this information ? pj : well , we go through about 35 or 40 people . we want to interview as many people as we could find . several refuse . we talk to about 15 or 16 of they classmate , which be experience . this be 55 - year- old woman spread out around the country , and they all have change they name because they would get marry . it be quite a detective job to find they . I read somewhere that the school be not particularly enthusiastic about this ; do they help you locate the ex-student ? pj : no , the school do not want anything to do with it . Christchurch Girls ' School have erase this two girl from they history . the yearbook that have the class photograph with pauline be no longer available . if you go to the school library , they have all the yearbook available apart from 1953' , which have she photo in it . it sort of cleanse of the book . the school do not recognize what it be we be try to do , which be to redress the issue . why wipe this girl off the school record ? I mean , they be human being . fw : Peter and Jim Booth , the producer of the movie , go to see the headmistress of the school , and after they explain what we want to do , and allow she to read the script , she only comment be , " why can not you make a film about pupil of whom we be proud ? " pj : we also hear from several source we interview that on the day after the murder happen , the headmistress at the time stand up in front of the assembly and say , " no girl be to discuss a certain matter . " this be , like , the day after two of they pupil have murder somebody , and they could not even refer to it directly . forty year later , we get the sense that the school be exactly the same . and that really give we all the more reason to make the movie , because we feel that this people be still live in the 1950s . we find that with a lot of the people we interview - that even though 40 year have go by , they be still present attitude of the ' 5as : this be some dark , sordid little thingthat be best keep quiet and should never be mention . many time we get , " why on earth would you want to make a film about this ? " we should just forget about it , and hope it will somehow disappear . " and we actually think about do that . but within 20 or 30 year most of the people connect with it will be dead , and at that point in time we will never know anything about it . we feel it be a good time now , while there be still quite a few people alive , to do the interview and try to get something accurate , for the record . we be also aware of the responsibility we have , because film be such a persuasive medium , and we know that , unlike any other medium - the newspaper account , the play- itcan give a audience visual image , which , in a way , almost replace the real event , especially if you be not bear at that time . so we think if we make a film now , perhaps people in New Zealand would look upon this case in a different way . that be a responsibility we feel that we do not want to take lightly . pertain to that quest for accuracy , how do one go about reconstruct , for instance , conversation between pauline and she mother , or other scene for which there be no direct documentation ? fw : well , all you can do be attempt to find out as much as you can about the people involve - the type of people they be , they class background , etc . so to that degree , we speak to people who know the rieper , for example , who have good knowledge of the girl . do you interview any of the border in the rieper house ? pj : yeah , I do , very briefly . we find one of the border , who speak to I on the telephone . I do the interview , and then the follow day I call he back to ask he some more question and he clamm up ; he do not want to talk to I anymore . he would obviously go home to he wife , and she would wound he up about the whole thing and tell he he should not be involved with it . fw : I think we understanding when we set out to write this be that we would never be able to re-create the right interior , with character who precisely reflect the people who be really there . we intention be to be true to what we understand of the girl ' friendship , and the nature of that friendship and the nature of that family from which that two girl come . it be never a attempt to re-create reality . we could never do that , obviously . so we go into that thing with the spirit of try to reflect the situation , rather than reality . pj : the hulme family be a lot easier to research than pauline 's family , because the hulme be public figure at the time . Henry hulme be the rector of the local university , there be obviously a lot of university people we could talk to professor , student - who work with he . hilda hulme be also quite a public figure . they be , in some respects , the royalty of Christchurch , because the English class system be and still do exist down there , and they all take this thing quite seriously . there use to be garden and tennis party at ilam , and there be a lot of people who have social contact with the parent and juliet at the time . the research actually carry on through the shoot of the film . I remember when we be in England , audition actress for the part of juliet before we find kate winslet , and we find out that [ the late ] Anthony quayle , the English actor , have actually visit the hulme in Christchurch in the ' 5as , so we track down he wife and speak with she . the research just keep on go all the time . we have trip to Christchurch to do we research , but once we start work on the film , we move there for nearly five month , so it be a ideal opportunity to find other . we would hear thing about this person who have sit next to pauline in type class , and we would rush around to see they . I be sure the production get a certain amount of notice in the local media , so people probably approach you . pj : to a extent , but not as much as what we have hope . pauline 's people be actually quite difficult to research , because they just be not public ; they be quite private people . fw : we have hear , subsequently , that pauline 's sister , Wendy , have see the film . she still life in Christchurch . her con meet be that the film manage to capture the atmosphere of she home at that time , but she criticism be that the family be " better " than that , we have portray they in too shabby a light . and that really touch I . pj : she think that the portrayal of the tension between pauline and she mother be very accurate . it be nice , because Wendy be one of the few key people alive who refuse to talk about it . she absolutely refuse to have anything to do with journalist , with anyone , so it be actually very sweet of she to get the message back to we . it be quite amazing to we that she have even go to see this film . she think it be good , but incredibly difficult to watch . in gather all of this material , I be sure there be certain thing that do not " fit " dramatically . be there anything you be tempt to use but do not , because it be either too sensationalistic or too ethically questionable ? pj : there be one area we deliberately steer clear of that we feel ultimately do not have a relation to what we be want to tell , and that be that in the rieper household there be actually a young sister , name Rosemary , who have down 's syndrome , who be still alive ; Wendy still look after she . at the time of the murder , Rosemary be only 8 year old . this make honora 's life all the more difficult : the daughter live in a special home , and would come home on the weekend . pauline write about Rosemary a lot in she diary ; she be very fond of she . but it be one area where we feel that we be be too invasive into the privacy of this family . as you say , there be quite a bit of stuff we have to leave out for structural reason . pauline 's diary be very , very funny . we end up use a lot of the more dramatic material in the movie , in the scene in which she 's talk about murder and suicide , but unfortunately we have to leave a lot of the funny thing out . she record hilarious conversation that she and juliet have , and it 's all very witty . sometimes we use diary entry and just dramatize they , as oppose to use a voiceover . like the sequence where they go into the fourth World , where the hilltop change into a magical landscape . that be describe in detail in the diary . so it be a case of have to be very selective , and at the end of the day , it be the more dramatic selection that make it through to the movie rather than the funnier stuff . the girl ' sense of humor do manage to come through in the film , though . I be think , for instance , of the last scene in the rieper house , when the family be have lunch with juliet before the two girl and honora go to Victoria Park . be they snide comment about Sir Edmund hillary in the diary , or be they invent by the two of you ? fw : that be out of we imagination . we be tell that they be extremely jolly at that last meal - it be actually in the court record - and that they be crack joke , and say silly , outrageous thing , on a sort of giggly high . and we know that Wendy have work at Farmer 's , the localdepartment store , and also what have be very big in the news that year be Sir Edmund hillary , a New Zealander , climb mt. everest . he have be knight , and become a huge national hero ; he still be . because he would also spend time in Christchurch , we feel that this be a appropriate thing for they to send up , because whatever they do , they be terribly irreverent . if the Queen be visit , for example , they would not bother to go out unless it be to take note of the decoration , the pomp and ceremony , to enrich one of they own royal celebration . they really have no respect for the icon of the day ; they interior world be much more important to they . the film critic for time , Richard corliss , liken you to a " physician who assume a patient fever in order to understand she illness . " at what point do you two decide that this be go to have to be present from the girl ' point of view ? pj : I think from the beginning . that be one of the motivation for do it . none of the account we come across be from the girl ' point of view . like we would say before , they all have other agendas , so we feel that tell the girl ' story be important . it do take we a long time to be able to do that , because it take we a long time to learn who they be , and what be drive they . we be a bit confuse - there be a bit of mystery at the beginning - but the more we read , the more we talk to people , we gradually begin to formulate who this people be . ultimately , there be a lot of pauline that I could recognize in myself , which be very useful . you , too , Fran ? fw : I feel that the diary : offer the first insight into the friendship , and into pauline in particular . it be a extremely interesting account of she life , document both dramatic and mundane event with a great deal of literary flair . she be a very imaginative , funny and clever young woman who have some quite pretentious idea , as teenager do , and I warm toward she immediately . reading the diary make I wonder about the huge discrepancy between this young woman and the monster who be portray in the newspaper account and everything else . and I think it would be great to take that journey to find out who she be . because no diary of juliet 's survive - we have hear from people that she do keep a diary , but it be destroy - I think it would be harder to get to know she , but that really be not the case , because she appear to be someone who more readily share she life with people ; she be much more of a social creature than pauline . so it be a combination of the private world that they share and the understanding that we get from talk to they school friend , inparticular , that give we insight into the nature of this two girl and the way they appear to the rest of the world . I think it 's fair to say that both Peter and I feel hugely sympathetic toward pauline and juliet , and we do start to identify and empathize with they , all the while try to keep in balance the knowledge of this terrible act . it be that dynamic , of really like they , but feel abhorrence at what they would do , that keep the thing alive for so long in we mind , and give the film inner life . Peter , you camera work , in all of the film you have direct , be extremely dynamic . in ' heavenly creature , ' the almost hyperactive camera seem to have a organic relationship to the girl ' euphoric state . I have notice in this script that a lot of this camera direction be write in , with more detail than most other screenplays I have read . do all of you script read like this ? pj : in this particular screenplay , camera movement come quite readily during the write stage . at the end of the day , the script be not the document we want to go out and sell ; it 's the document that the cast and crew have to read . when we write a script intend for I to direct , it 's right from the beginning a shoot script ; a document for technician to use . you know , the grip put a circle around the word " dolly " so they remember on that particular day of shoot they be go to have to have it on the truck . with this movie , probably more than any other I have do , the camera move be integral to the scriptwrite . I will tell you where that come from : the music . we read very early in we research that pauline and juliet be both obsessed with mario lanza . neither of we be familiar with he music , so we go out and get some of he record , and before we start write we play through they and come across several song that we really like . one of the very first one we hear be " the donkey serenade " - fw : well , we know that be important to they because pauline have name one of she novel " the donkey serenade . " pj : when we hear it , just the life and vitality in the song immediately indicate steadicam . [ laugh ] it immediately tell you you have to have a move camera . we choose all the song that be in the movie , and , in the case of " the donkey serenade , " write scene around they . I find it a great visual tool . it 's never happen before in anything I have do - I mean , I have never have the music in advance . we have this song play while we be work to get ourselves psyched up to write a scene . at the same time , the music help I visualize , so that visualization end up go down on the page . of course , once you actually arrive on the set , and you have the actor and the camera people there , thing can change . I do not regard anything that 's write into a script in term of a camera direction asbeing lock in stone . how long do it take the two of you to finish a first draft ? pj : not really long . I think the first draft be write in probably 10 or 12 week . but we do not start to write until we would uncover several month ' worth of research . and the draft we be publishing be the shoot script ? pj : yeah . I think that 's about draft number five . we do a interesting thing . we do a certain amount of research first , while we be still work on braindead [ Dead alive in U.S. ] , and then we write the first draft from the position where we feel we know some of the fact , but there be a lot of gap . we think if we write a draft we would know where the hole be , and we would know what we have to pursue in term of research . for instance , Fran and I have never be down to Christchurch when we write this first draft , and Christchurch be such a integral part of the story . then we make the trip down there before the second draft and be able to modify a lot of thing , interview lot more people . we actually do that on purpose , because we want to nail the story before overlay it with a lot of historical detail . how do the two of you handle write collaboratively ? pj : well , it depend . you know , if Fran 's work on some re-write while we be shoot , and I be on the set , she will show I some work that she 's do when I come home and we will revise it together , but generally , when we be actually write the initial draft of the script , it 's always together . I think that we both have a good understanding of structure , which help , and I be obviously very visually orient , and Fran be very good on dialogue and character , so we complement each other quite well . I think the best advantage that we have in write script together be that we write a script that I go and make , which be , I think , a wonderful thing . it would be a strange experience for we to write a script that someone else be go to make , because we have never actually experience that loss of control that so many other writer have . so right from the very beginning , it 's a movie . it 's not a piece of write that 's go to go out to the marketplace and may or may not sell . just one little thing . even though heavenly creature be very much write by the two of we , my favorite scene in the movie be write by Fran by herself . which one be that ? pj : well , it be late one night , and we be hope to finish the first draft of the script - it be , like , ten o'clock already - and we have arrive at the sequence in the tearoom where they be have they last cup of tea before they walk down the track . we sit there wonder how on earth we be go to write this scene . we know they would actually go there to have tea because we would speak to this very elderly woman who have serve they . she say they be talk quite calmly to one another . but what dialogue do you put in they mouth at this particular moment , when this woman 's about to be murder ? well , the phone ring , and I get up to answer it and end up stick on this call for about 45 minute , and I come back and Fran have write something . she ask I to check it out , and it be never revise : it 's where she slide the plate with the last cake over to honora , and say , " go on , mother , treat yourself . " it be perfect . I know you find kate winslet at a audition in England . how do you come across Melanie lynskey , who play pauline ? I understand she be not a professional actress . pj : well , it 's one of that storey that sound like it 's not true . we want to cast someone in New Zealand , and we would audition a lot of people - five or six hundred - who be either videotape or photograph . I want to find someone who be young , around 1s or 16 year old ; I do not want a 23 - year - old in a school uniform . and we want someone who be physically very much like the original pauline ; I have a thing about be as accurate as possible . so we quickly exhaust the professional actor in New Zealand who happen to look like pauline - there 's only about one or two . [ laugh ] we know we be look for someone with no experience , but we just have to find they . we keep say , " somewhere in New Zealand there 's somebody who 's perfect for this role . " we be actually about four week away from beginning shoot , and we have one or two people on the short list , neither of whom we be happy with , but we be come under enormous pressure to cast one of they , because , you know , the wardrobe department need to make costume , and so on , and Fran say to I , " you be not really happy with the choice , be you ? " and I say , " no . " and she say , " this be crazy ; we have spend all this time and energy on this film and we have not find pauline . this be something close to a major tragedy . " I be in Christchurch , so Fran decide to drive with a casting person around the lower half of the North Island of New Zealand - she be prepare to drive as far as she have to . they would visit every small town , go to the local school , visit the principal 's office and show a photo of pauline parker . she would say , " we be make a movie about pauline parker ; do you have any pupil in you school who resemble she who might be interested in this ? " fw : we be in a rusting Ford cortina , and we have no official i.d . we would roll up to this provincial school , and we would be greet by some curious teacher . although no one ever once question we authenticity , we would always get ask about the car : " if you be in film , why be not you drive a porsche ? " [ both laugh ] so then I would pitch the story to the entire classroom , scan the room the whole time , look for sullen , brood school girl , all the while think , " what would she look like with she hair dyed black ? " pj : I guess that go on for about a week . every night I would get a call from Fran . anyone that be vaguely appropriate be videotape , and I get a couple of tape in Christchurch , and it be a bit depress . finally , Fran call from a small town call New plymouth , and say , " I think I have find someone very interesting . ' and this be mel . we fly she down to Christchurch and give she a audition and a screen test , and we cast she two week before the film start shoot . I call she mother up on a Friday night and say , " I would really like Melanie to do the film . " and she say , " when do she have to start ? " and I say , " well , she 's get to come down here on Sunday . " the poor girl do not even get a chance to go back to school to clean out she locker . do you think there be any correspondence between the two actress and they background and that of the character they be play ? pj : one of the thing that we know about pauline be that she be incredibly witty and intelligent , and Melanie be very similar - she be the top student in she province in many subject . and we know if we cast a intelligent person , then they be go to hit it . Melanie 's also very enigmatic . the character of pauline do not have a enormous amount of dialogue . in a sense , the real pauline parker speak for she , through the diary . so what we be look for be a actress who have that kind of aspect to she that 's a real movie-star thing : where you can film somebody sit in a room , do nothing , and they be still fascinating to watch . we find that in mel . I have read that you use actual location for some of this . pj : as much as we could . the only location we could not use be pauline 's house , which have be tear down . fortunately , the school be now a community center ; the actual school move to a different location , so they no longer have control over the building ; otherwise we would have definitely be refuse permission . the school building be now own by the Christchurch City Council , which have do nothing to they ; they be as they be 40 year ago . they just rent out the various room to community group . we find out what classroom pauline and juliet actually be in , and it be the canterbury woman 's embroidery Guild - it sound like something out of monty python - and we go into the room and right down one length of the wall be this huge tapestry that have be stretch out on this massive frame . I think they would never want to take it down , but we manage to get they to do it . so that be the actual classroom where they be , down to the seating . the ilam house , where juliet live , be still there . it 's own by the university , and they be very happy for we to use it . as for the doctor 's surgery , where pauline be interview by the doctor , we find out the address , and - you know , this be 40 year later , so you have no idea what to expect - it be just , like , a suburban house . we think that be strange , in that it do not seem like a doctor 's office . anyway , we knock on the door , and the woman who answer happen to be the doctor 's daughter - the doctor 's long since dead - and we ask she where she father 's office have be , and she say , " oh , he have room out the back of the house here ; we have never really touch they . " we go into this doctor 's surgery which be almost exactly the same as it have be 40 year before . so we end up filming that sequence in the actual room where pauline be interview by the doctor . we also speak to the woman who be work at the tearoom at Victoria Park and find out exactly where they sit , and film that scene there . actually , about two month later , that building be demolish . and what about the murder scene ? pj : well , we go to the murder site , and we just feel uncomfortable about filming there . it be very strange , and maybe it be just we imagination , but it be very quiet , very tranquil . I mean , all the way down the path you hear the wind and the bird , and suddenly , when you arrive at the spot , you hear nothing . so we film the murder scene at Victoria Park , but it be on a different track , about a hundred yard away . there be one sequence of scene in this script which do not appear in the film . it begin with the tennis party at ilam , in which pauline and juliet be watch from behind some shrubbery as walter perry and hilda hulme play tennis . pj : well , that sequence be actually shot , and exist in the version of the film that be screen here in New Zealand . when miramax release the film in the U.S. , they have screening and feel that the film be too long . we have final control over the film , but they plead with we to take out about 10 minute ' worth of footage , convinced that it would be tighter . we look at it , and we actually , ultimately , agree with they in a funny sort of way . that sequence slow the momentum down . it 's quite a fun one to read - and it 's fun in the film as well - but it do slow thing down at a point where we do not think thing should be slow down . although we have have control over the film 's release all over the world , we have request that the sequence be cut out of the version screen in every other country . when you be write a script , a part of you think , " oh , this be perfect , we must not change a word of it , " but once it 's finish it take a life of its own . we feel that the sequence be not tell we anything wedid not already know about the character , and at a time where the tension in pauline 's house be really grow , go over to juliet 's house to watch a tennis game be not necessary . fw : I think when we write the script we feel it be very much pauline and juliet 's story . after the edit , however , it become very evident to we that it be pauline 's story which be the through line and the audience 's focal point . whenever we veer too much into tell the hulme story and pauline be not on the screen , the pace start to flag . that be something we have to look at after the first assembly - we have to trim and cut hulme scene because they be not as fundamentally interesting as the rieper scene . although this film be very different from braindead , both take place in the New Zealand of the 1950s . I be not that familiar with you country , but from watch this two film I would have to assume that it be , at least in that period , a fairly repressive kind of society , act almost as a breeding ground for transgression , for explosive kind of behavior . pj : well , the script for braindead be set in the modern day up until the very last minute . I be worried go into the movie that the hero of the film , name lionel , act in a fairly nerdy kind of way - he do not socialize , he take care of he mother - and yet we want he to be the empathetic character in the film . I be afraid that if it be set in the modern day , the audience - especially a young audience - would really jeer at this character , and not be able to relate to he at all . if we set it inthe ' 5as , people might actually feel more sympathy for he , because they would think , " well , that sort of thing happen then . " with heavenly creature , it be really just a coincidence that the actual event have take place then . fw : but that repression be still very much in evidence here : we be I not expressive , we be not demonstrative , we be scared of show , say too much . when you go to New York , for instance , and people be yell and the horn be blaring - if that happen here , someone would get out of theircar , rip open you door and bash you up . there 's a level of violence , a subtext of violence , run through New Zealand society that come out in we movie . we have a veneer of be easygoing , but underneath , we be full of rage . it 's a interesting social dynamic . and it make for interesting art , but it 's not so pleasant to actually live in it . it 's very much to do with a link with England - pj : Christchurch in particular . fw : Christchurch suffer from it more than any other city in New Zealand . it 's always be describe as " a little piece England " ; it 's consider to be more English than England . it 's always aspire to be that , and it still be in some way . pj : the thing with this murder , too , be that the sense you when you talk to the older generation in Christchurch be that it be a embarrassment to the city , that it be somehow shameful and somehow humiliate . which be ridiculous , because the story be ultimately a family tragedy . fw : it 's be say that Christchurch be more appal by revelation that pauline 's parent be not marry than by the murder itself . and some uncharitable soul even suggest that one sinful act lead on to the other . speak generally about you film , you both seem to have a certain love of campiness , which be apparent in the use of caricature for many character , as well as in a overall sort of extremism reminiscent of the work of someone like John Waters here in the U.S. what 's interesting about heavenly creature be that while it remain a fundamentally " realistic " docudrama , some of the figure of authority , like the doctor , the vicar and the headmistress , be hilariously overplay . pj : well , I like movie to be entertaining , to be a little larger than life . with something like braindead , obviously there 's no problem do that . but with ' heavenly creature , ' we be tell what we hope would be a fairly accurate story . at the same time , however , I still want to make a movie ; I do not want something totally tie to real life , and totally dull . so we do have a little bit of fun with some of that character . I guess if you be try to justify it you could say we be present they from the girl ' point of view , but that 's not strictly true . I just think that there be really only two people who we need to be realistic with , and they be juliet and pauline , both of whom be slightly larger than life anyway . that 's something that come across in the interview with they classmate . they be remember as be sort of terrifying : juliet be so confident and loud , and pauline be brood and dark . so , in a sense , the film be a perfect one for we . I do not like do stuff that 's totally naturalistic . I just like have a little bit of fun . the fantasy sequence be write pretty much as they appear on film . be you aware of how , technically , you be go to handle this special effect as you be write ? pj : pretty much . we have not use any optical or digital effect in braindead , and with heavenly creature , I know that if I actually write digital effect into the script , then it be a great excuse to go out and get this new equipment - I have my own special effect company . so right at the beginning we write stuff that could only be do with morph . we get one computer and hire someone to figure out how it all work . what about you use of the plasticine figure ? be that something you would hear the girl be interested in ? pj : yeah , we interview several people who remember that they use to model figure in plasticine , and I think herbert rieper refer to it in he court testimony . we also interview a old guy who have be round to the hulme 's place and have see juliet 's plasticine horse on the mantelpiece . and , of course , there be endless passage in the diary about borovnia , and diello , the murderous prince and all of that . when we think it would be fun right at the beginning to go into some of this fantasy sequence , the last thing I want to do be dress up actor in medieval costume and crown and have they look like something out of a school play . so we decide it would be really fun to tie the plasticine figure and borovnia together . and we know they would sculpt figure like diello , so we just think , why not have that figure come to life , as it be . what about the link of certain actor to certain figure , like Orson Welles to diello ? pj : well , that be something that we devise ourselves . but again , that spring from the fact that the girl use to give pet name to people . like one of the border in the diary , for instance , be refer to as John for a while , and then he name change to Nicholas . that 's refer to in the scene in pauline 's sleepout . pj : yeah , and for some reason , pauline refer to he as Nicholas in the rest of she diary . that happen with a lot of people . they be clearly use real , live people as prototype for some of they fantasy character . we figure that diello have a lot of quality that they seem to fear in Orson Welles . he seem to represent some sort of dark , sexual force , so we figure that give he feature to the figure of diello be appropriate . could you talk about the fact that , during production , Anne perry , the mystery writer , be " oute " as be juliet hulme ? fw : well , where do you start ? we know that would be a possible outcome of make this film - that someone might try and track down either pauline or juliet . which be a very good reason not to make the movie . we have more compelling reason to make the film , however , because if we do not , anotherone be go to get make anyway . there be , at the time the film be be fund , five compete project in various state of preparation . do not Dustin hoffman have something in the work ? fw : his company , punch production , I believe , have a script write by a american writer ; Peter have , in fact , be very tentatively approach to read it , that be how we find out about it . at that point we be about a week away from start to shoot . and then someone be try to do a film version of the play we have already speak of , and other people be develop a very politicize lesbian version of the story . then there would be a screenplay write by the late English novelist , Angela Carter , that be with a production company in Auckland , and there be someone in Australia develop a screenplay . so we know that this story be go to come to the screen , soon - there be no doubt someone be go to make it . and we feel that , in that climate , we would proceed , despite the possibility that this woman might be expose . we know that in pauline 's case it be less likely . we would hear a lot of rumor and gossip about juliet , but we would hear nothing about pauline , and I think she have very carefully hide she identity . juliet go to no such trouble : she take she stepfather 's name - hilda hulme end up marrying walter perry - as a novelist , and proceed to write a series of crime novel . you can look up any contemporary author index in any library , and there be Anne perry , and she birthdate be the same as juliet hulme 's , she mother 's maiden name be the same , etc . there be a gap in she personal history , where she leave out New Zealand , but it pick up again after she leave the country . so it do not take a huge amount of detective work from the journalist here in New Zealand who have hear that Anne perry and juliethulme be one and the same . that rumor spring from a production of the play that have go on here a year before we start shoot , where a friend of juliet 's , who be still write to she , confide in one of the actor that juliet hulme be now write murder mystery as Anne perry . that rumor hew around the act community here in New Zealand , and it reach we ear on the set , and it be something that we want to entirely disassociate ourselves from , because we know it would damage the film , and we know it would damage we . it be inevitable that we would be accuse of exploit this woman 's situation in order to promote the movie . when this journalist ring Peter and ask what comment he have about the story , he just begge she not to print it . of course that be a hopeless situation , because she be a tabloid hack who be go to go ahead and make she name , and she have dine off it ever since . we feel a enormous amount of dread , because the movie have not have a chance to stand on its own before this be make know , and it 's now be inextricably link with this revelation . so we have be battle that ever since . but give that it 's happen , we have have to deal with it , as she have . pj : I mean , we be absolutely disgust by some of the ad miramax run . on the day that this be release in America , I ring miramax and say , " for heaven 's sake , do not associate this film with any of this because we do not approve of this publicity . " and a couple of month later , lo and behold , we get send by a friend in the States clipping with this ad say , " murder , she wrote , " and this other reference to Anne perry that miramax have be run , and we be just very , very angry . do you fever consider use the coordinate of the actual event , but change enough of the particular to push it into the fictional realm ? pj : no , because the case be so well - know in New Zealand ; it would be like - fw : fictionalize the O.J. Simpson case . pj : it 's unnecessary . I mean , sure , if it be just a movie for international consumption , then , yeah . but the fact be that we be not actually make this film for a international audience . we be very much make it to try and rectify 40 year of misunderstanding about this case within New Zealand . in a way that be we main motivation for make the film , and in do that , we obviously have to use they real name . but have say that , " pauline parker " and " juliet hulme " cease to exist as people in 1959 , because they both take different name . in a sense , I do not think there be any moral problem with use that name , because they themselves stop use they some 30 - odd year ago . be there any other film you look at as inspiration before write this ? fw : well , we look at movie like let him have it , which be base on the Craig / bentley murder case in England [ bentley be a 18 - year - old with a low i.q. who be hang for murder ] . although I think that film have quite a lot of merit , in the end it come across as a grim , dark , true - life murder story , and similarly dance with a Stranger , which be about Ruth Ellis [ the last woman to be hang in England ] . we feel that if there be one thing we do not want to do , it be to make a depress murder film . we really want to tell a tale of a friendship , rather than a murder story . sure , the movie end with a murder , but for the most part , it celebrate friendship . pj : we want to make it a lot funnier than that film . and people have say , " it 's such a serious subject ; why do you try to make it funny ? " well , obviously the murder be not funny , and we never attempt to make it funny , but the friendship be funny . life be funny : generally , human being like to enjoy themselves , and there be no doubt that pauline and juliet have a hell of a good time , most of the time . fw : but the other reason why it be important that we tell this as a true story be that it have a kind of universal truth for anybody grow up . when you be at that age , you become very focus on thing in a extreme way . and I do not think pauline and juliet be so very different from anybody else ; I think several thing go wrong in they life - juliet 's parent break up , and pauline become very alienate from she family ( she be a obsessional manic - depressive character ) - and I think it be this terriblecombination of thing that lead to this extraordinarily horrible act . but it 's not something that can be preclude from anybody 's experience in grow up . adolescence be such a crazy time . pj : a lot of woman have come up to we and say , " I be pauline . that be I . that be my childhood . " I do not think it 's that unusual . I think what be unusual about the whole thing be that this aspect of pauline 's character lead to the murder , and I do not think the sort of person she be be particularly unusual or freakish or weird . when we hear thing like that , it 's the best possible endorsement we could get .
