JOHN off almost out of control again , erwin resch . and now he be number one . in the intermediate time : one , forty eight , seventy three . that 's the best time downhill this far . billy off this section of austrian hole be name because thirty year ago nine out of twelve austrian fall down in there . it 's a very difficult section . the final turn . resch lean over a little bit . JOHN off .......... thirteen thirty eight , the time to beat .  u3 '' '' he can take first place if he take it here . two , eleven , 0 six . yes , erwin resch from Austria . in first place . so the rivalry continue here . take two austrian up top . but many more skier to come . erwin resch aut leader bill johnson UNITED states billy off now out of start house , this be twenty three year old Bill Johnson . before this week no one really know who he be . but then on Friday , he turn in the best time at a training run . last year he win the europa Cup . '' y '' p` consider the junior World Cup . he 's be racing for sixteen year , and two year ago he show up for ski team practice and the coaches say he be out of shape . so they send he back to dry land training . but he 's come back strong . JOHN off they want to keep he on the team now because he be really a fast skier . he have the fastest run at training very often . but very often he 's too fast , he can not keep together all the way . billy off last year on aspen Mountain in Colorado , he take a ¬Ç p -' high speed fall in America 's down-hill he sustained a severe concussion . he 's very agressive , and sometimes skis out of control . wait for that second , the second , what time , the fastest so far , but , Johnson be lose it , no , faster I fear , he 's off the course , he 's on the course again . Johnson 's all over this hill . only about eight hundred metre leave and he 's still on the course . I do not believe it . he push right to the absolute limit , here 's the last turn , the last jump . time 's two eleven √¨ ( tm ) '' p¬≠ 0 six , that 's very prescious time . can he do it ?

I think he be totally out of the race there for a moment . JOHN off Johnson be one of the best flier in the world , he try to keep he skis right on the snow . but it 's dangerous at seventy mile a hour you can catch a edge , like '' 3 ... p√µ '' he do right here . watch he leave ski , the edge catch , the skis split apart . he pull they back together , they split again , he pull they back together once more right here , and that ski knock the other ski out . I can not believe that he pull that ski back . he 's on one ski now , he fall over backwards and he barely pull himself up . he go through the air off the course , get back on the course again . what a run . lider hold it , hold , hold , hold it , slow down , we will get to all you question , alright ? just one at a time . ¬∏ '' x^ girl tell I , Bill , what be go through you mind ? bill win . right coach ? lider Bill be a fighter . a street - smart competitor . he have the potential to be one of the most gift athelete I have ever coach . now we serve notice today that this be just the beginning . the United States ski team be a power to be reckone with in all future Alpine event . reporter Bill , what be you chance in the Olympic come up ? bill chance have nothing to do with it .
