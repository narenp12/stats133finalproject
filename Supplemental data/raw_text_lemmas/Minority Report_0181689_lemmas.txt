Anderson eye the side of the black granite office building close to he . anderson be Pov - a high pressure hydrant the large red hydrant sit a few inch out from the building . ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 71 . Anderson almost smile as he begin to walk slowly toward it , he weapon point harmlessly at the pavement . voice ( cont 'd ) do not move ! Anderson be up on the sidewalk now , two foot out from the building , right beside the high pressure hydrant . he stop , look up , look down , look at the police advance . it be a moment for prayer . Anderson do not have a moment . he spread he foot and fire a massive sonic blast down at the sidewalk . the effect on the underground water main be immediate . a geyser of water two foot in diameter erupt straight up from the sidewalk , lift the tumble Anderson fifteen foot into the air right alongside the building . the stunne police officer try to take aim , but Anderson 's bounce at the top of the geyser . and they can not fire , anyway , because officer worker stare at the excitement from every window in the building . all this in a time span of second . the world spin crazily for anderson , but he manage to grip hold of a metal support beam hold the building 's sign , one story up . the police try to see what he 's do , but the torrent of water from the water main break obscure he move . he pull himself onto a ledge , steady himself , slide along it toward a second story window . the office building gawker lurch backward from the window as Anderson blast it to sparkling dust and leap inside . int . office build the building cover almost a entire city block . Anderson , drip wet , run from one end of it to another , blast through door , shove terrify worker out of the way . he be like a wide receiver run the length of the field , jump obstacle , slamm through , over , and around whatever he must to get to he goal . and then he reach he goal -- the window overlook the avenue next block over and parallel to the one where precrime ambush he . he spot a double - decker turbotram move slowly in the stream of traffic . it pull to the curb below to pick up passenger . Anderson blast out the window and leap onto the roof of the bus . it be a bone-jarring landing . he lose consciousness for a second , roll the length of the roof , and slide off it onto the pavement . ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 72 . he lie there , try to rouse himself . traffic brake to a stop automatically as car and truck sensor read he form in the road . no one want to touch he . a single car horn sound , and then a chorus of they . Anderson rouse , struggle to he foot , and take off in a limping run . int . subway station later Anderson , out of breath and in pain , lean against a post at the far end of the passenger platform . there be track on either side of he , one mark " uptown " and the other " downtown . " he feel a blast of air and look to he right and see that the downtown train be come in . and on he leave , too , the uptown train round the bend and come into view . which maglev train will lead he to safety ? which one will not they pinpoint ? he run up to a teenage kid who have he arm around he girlfriend . they step back , startle . he 's get a flat top hair cut , she wear a pleate skirt and saddle shoe . the train pull in . anderson pick one for I ! kid what ? they try to walk away anderson Point to the train I should take . please . kid I do not know . the girl lift a nervous finger and point . the uptown . he run to board it , as they run in the opposite direction to the downtown . int . subway car he sit at the back of the half empty train watch the dark rush by . a train choose arbitrarily -- it 's impossible they could find he . a station stop . he start to get off , be actually on the platform , then step back onto the train . the rush dark again . when the maglev ease to a halt at the next station he get off this time . ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 73. int . station he walk toward the exit stair with a handful of people . he ease back and let they go up first . the stair precrime officer crouch around the bend , silently snatching people out of the way as they come into view . they wait - but Anderson do not come . and he do not come . on signal , the precrime officer rush down the stair . doorway above the stair anderson hang high above the doorway near the ceiling , adhere by one arm there by a blue glob of adhesive bindfoam . anderson be Pov - the officer as they run below he down the stair . they go out of sight , he can hear they rush along the platform search for he . the strain of hang by one arm be kill he . he reach up . with a laser knife , and cut away at he coat sleeve , release himself from the glob . he drop to the stair , and instantly slip up they . he surprise a helmete officer , just around the bend . he slam he against the wall , yank off he helmet , and hold the laser knife against he throat . the officer 1s clearly terrify . he speak hoarsely through Anderson 's choke grip . officer do not kill I ! jesus. please . Anderson look at the panicked officer . Anderson close he eye try to put it together . he open they . anderson but the precogs would have predict I kill you . you would know whether I do or not . the officer look at he with eye begging for mercy .

Anderson chop quickly at the base of the man 's skull , knock he out . and then he run , because what else can he do ? int . judicial CENTER -- day Lisa stand in a long hallway outside a door , label : courtroom 17 . she hold a briefcase in one hand . down the hall , other courtroom be in use , but not this one . she enter the dark and vacant courtroom 17 . int . courtroom 17 Lisa sit at the judge 's bench in the empty courtroom . the light be dim . she take a small , battery - power tv out of she briefcase . she turn it on . tv the murder of witwer by Anderson be be show over and over in a continuous loop . flash at the bottom be the hotline number : " 1-800 - precrime .

Anderson scream out in agony , slam back against the wall of the bathroom . his hand reach up for he face -- which look like it 's boil from within . anderson's face the skin on both cheek begin to pucker . the muscle tone around he chin go soft , and begin to sag like a old man' . that be the effect -- like he be aging fifty year . his forehead wrinkle , the skin under he eye droop . healthy pink be replace by bloodless gray . and mother of GOD doe it hurt ext . the men' room the attendant knock nervously on the door attendant you all right in there ? when the door open , a unhealthy look old guy with a fedora hat pull low come slowly out of the bathroom . Anderson nod , and walk past the attendant , who watch after he uncertainly as he wander off . int . precrime headquarters - alexandria -- later the perky tour guide we meet earlier take another group around the headquarters . there may be a massive campaign to find Anderson , but the precrime public relation machine continue to run without interruption . there be ten people in the group , and the physically transformed Anderson be among they . they all wear glow nametag . Anderson 's read , " Mr. symington .

Three of the guard rush out of the room , one stay behind . the three precogs sit in they oversize chair , the female in the middle , the male on either side of she . they eye be open ... and they be deeply alert . two technician tend to the precogs . at the back of the chamber , through a large window , we see ennis page sit at the huge mainframe . ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 78 . int . search and command a ring of precrime officer three man deep stand guard around witwer . witwer look like he want to kill they all . witwer this be ridiculous . Lieutenant glaser reply forcefully lieutenant glaser stand order from the Security panel , sir . witwer if he want to get to I , he will get to I . lieutenant glaser no , he will not , sir . witwer look at the confident young officer almost pityingly . then he eye flick to the wall clock . int . the basement armed precrime officer clog the corridor , conduct defensive search of one room after another . all they be come up with so far be some very startle housekeeper . int . the precog chamber in the chamber be one guard , two technician , and three precogs . and all of they be leave in sudden darkness , as the power be cut . int . search and command the officer around witwer reach for they maglite flashlight . the search and Command room suddenly look exceedingly vulnerable . a technician call out from the darkness technician do not worry , air -emergency generator will kick on in five second . the green glow from a roomful of wristwatch make the room seem alive with firefly . five second go by . then ten more . witwer explanation , please ! technician uh , sir . it seem ... he get the generator , too . ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 79 . there be a long moment of silence . and then witwer begin to laugh . int . the precog chamber the room be utterly dark and silent . the silence be break by the SOUND of something roll across the floor . somebody speak , probably the guard . voice shit . a explosion of light fill the room in strobe - like blast . and leaping through the light be anderson . the temporarily blind guard and technician have drop to they knee . Anderson stun gun they quickly . the strobe fade , and Anderson set a zirc-flare on the floor . we see that the enzyme be wear off -- he facial feature be return to normal . he be oblivious to the precogs in they chair . it be the equipment he be after . through the observation window we see ennis page watch in horror as Anderson sever the light cable connect the precog helmet to the mainframe . Anderson aim a sonic blast at the observation window , blow it out and knock page unconscious . then he reach into the room and destroy the mainframe itself with a series of blast . Anderson be so intent on destruction he do not sense a presence behind he . perhaps it be because the movement be so completely devoid of malice it be beyond detection . a hand , the finger pale and slender , reach out and take hold of he hand . Anderson whirl around , weapon out . and there before he , be the female precog . he look at she , then beyond she to the other precogs who be lolling in semiconsciousness in they chair . her helmet be off . she be young , but she close - cropped hair be silver white . and when she speak , she voice be like the wind whisper through time . female save we , Anderson .
