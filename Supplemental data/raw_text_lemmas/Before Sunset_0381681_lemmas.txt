I be write a lot more in my journal , idea I have never think of before . jesse Communist idea ? celine shut up ! I be not a communist . jesse I know . go ahead , sorry . celine it take I a while to figure out why , why I feel so different . and then , one day as I be walk throvgh the jewish cemetery , I do not know why but it occur to I there , i realize I have just spend the past couple of week away from most of my habit . the tv be in a language I do not understand and there be nothing to buy , no advertisement anywhere . ( more } before sunrise sequel pink page 24/8/03 20a . celine ( cont 'd ) so all I have be do for three week be walk around , write , think . my brain feel like it be at rest , free from the consume frenzy and 1 have to say it be almost like a natural high . before sunrise sequel Green page 21/8/03 20b . celine ( cont 'd ) I be so peaceful inside , no strange urge to be somewhere else , to shop . before sunrise sequel pink page 24/8/03 21 . celine ( cont 'd ) maybe it could have seem like boredom at first but it quickly it become very soulful . jesse can you believe it be nine year ago we be walk around Vienna ? celine no , that 's impossible . jesse feel like two month ago ... but dune of " 94 . celine De I look any different ? jesse mommm . you hair be down back then , can you ... she undoe she hair . jesse keep look at she . jesse ( cont 'd ) Little skinnier I think . celine be I fat before ? jesse no , no . celine you think I be a fatty . you write a book about a fat girl . they both laugh . jesse no seriously - you look beautiful . do I look any different ? before sunrise sequel pink page 24/8/03 celine no ... you have this little line here . she point to the wrinkle between he eyebrow . jesse I know , I know . celine like a scar . jesse a scar ? like a gunshot wound ? celine no , I like it . I have a terrible nightmare the other day . I be have a awful dream that I be 32 , then i wake up and I be 23 , relieved , and then I wake up for real and I be 32 . jesse aw shit , it happen . celine time get faster and faster . apparently it 's because we do not renew we synapse after 20 , so it 's all pretty much downhill from then on . jesse on the other hand , I like get older . life feel more immediate - you can appreciate it more . celine oh I know . I actually like it too . jesse I be once a drummer in a band . celine you be ? jesse and we be pretty good too . but the lead singer be so obsessed with we get sign . we spend all we time think about get bigger gig - all about the future . and now the band do not even exist anymore . 22 . before sunrise sequel Green page 21/8/03 22a. jesse ( cont 'd ) but look back at that show we do , even rehersing , it be so much fun . before sunrise sequel pink page 24/8/03 jesse ( cont 'd ) I think now I would be able to enjoy every minute of it . celine well , you have get you book publish and you be travel ali over the they laugh . world with it ... be you enjoy it ? jesse not really . celine you know in my field , I see some people that come into it like with big idealist vision , of become the new leader that will create a better world , they enjoy the goal but not the process . jesse right . celine but the reality of it be that the true work of improve thing be in the little achievement of the day , and that 's what you need to enjoy to stay in that field . for example I work for a organization that help village in Mexico and they concern be how to get the pencil send to the kid in that little country school , it be not about discuss big revolutionary idea about a better world - it be about pencil . I see the people that do the real work , and what in a way be really sad be that the people that be often the most give , hard work and capable of make this world better do not really have the ambition and ego to be a leader , they do not see any interest in the reward , they do not care if they name ever appear in the press , they actually enjoy the process of help other , they be truly in the moment . jesse yeah , that 's such a struggle . ( more } 23 . toh of + of before sunrise sequel pink page 24/8/03 23a . jesse ( cont 'd ) it seem like we be design to be slightly dis-contented with everything . always try to better @ we situation . you satisfy one desire and it just agitate another . but then I think , well , desire be the fuel of life . do you think it 's true that we would never be unhappy if we never want anything ? before sunrise sequel Green page 21/8/03 24 . celine I do not know actually . not want anything ... be not it a symptom of depression ? it 's very human to desire . jesse that 's what all that Buddhist cat say , right , liberate yourself from desire and you will find you already have everything you need . celine but I feel human when I want something more than just basic survival need . wanting , whether it 's intimacy with another person or a new pair of shoe be kind of beautiful . I like that we have ever- renewing desire . jesse yeah ... I guess it 's just entitlement that bring all the pain . whenever you feel you deserve that pair of shoe , that you desire should be meet . it 's all right to have want and need as long as you do not get angry when they be not realize . life be hard , it 's suppose to be , if we do not suffer we would never learn a thing . celine so what , be you like a Buddhist or something ? jesse no. celine why not ? jesse i do not know , it 's probably like when I go to a museum I do not get - the headphone with the guide tour . before sunrise sequel pink page 24/8/03 celine I know .
