I say we cross the bitch . holloway right . quentin how many boot do we have leave holloway ? -------------------------------------------------------------------- they look at Kazan 's foot . just one boot leave . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin get it off he . we know how it work , we just have to be quiet . worth pretty fuck quiet . quentin I be glad you be on sight Worth , because you be up . -------------------------------------------------------------------- Kazan make a sound . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin and he 's not come . holloway of course he be . quentin no way ! holloway you be not leave he behind . quentin he 's unpredictable . when we get to the edge we can come back for he , but he will get somebody kill here . be I right ? holloway shame on you . will you look at yourselves . what have you turn into ? they may have take we life away , but we be still human being . that 's all we have get leave . leaven we will come back for he . holloway that 's a lie and you know it . worth he will be quiet . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin open the door and put Worth down there . he hang in the ceiling by himself now with a boot in he mouth . he crawl down the wall . meanwhile we hear something nearby . as it 's no longer be to hear . Worth open a door , nothing happen , and crawl in . leaven be up next . afterwards holloway . next be Kazan . as leaven be in Worth and holloway stand on the floor . Kazan crawl in the ceiling and afterwards he crawl the wrong way . holloway go to get he . suddenly he pants be stick in the handle on the floor . holloway try to unloose it . next up be quentin . now all be in except quentin . he be on he way . in the floor the door be open . so quentin hurry up and be not safe as the handle stop turn . he wait to be spear . nothing happen . -------------------------------------------------------------------- kazan hah ! -------------------------------------------------------------------- now the spear come again , quentin just make it into the passage . now we be in a red room . quentin grab Kazan and almost beat he . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin you fuck fuck ! holloway that 's enough ! quentin he 's a trap ! holloway let he go right now ! quentin Law of the jungle holloway . he 's a danger in the pack ! holloway let he go you nazi ! -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin let go of Kazan . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin what do you call I ? holloway quentin ! you let that innocent boy go . quentin you listen to I woman . every day I mop up after you bleed heart . the only reason why you exist be because I keep you !

I get we down there . you think we out . believe in I . try to see what I see , how my mind work . thrash ! when I look into someone 's head like a fuck x- ray . I look through the wall .

I take you down . the perfect key . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin go further and try to touch she breast . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin I will slip you on the lock . -------------------------------------------------------------------- leaven run away . quentin stand up . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin leaven ... it 's time to go down . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin try to catch she . meanwhile a door be be open . Worth come jump hit quentin to the floor . Kazan enter the room too . the door close . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin get away from she . leaven , they be fuck spy' . him , the retard . holloway have outside information about my family . she go too far . leaven you drop she . worth just go quentin leaven give we the boot , you pig ! -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin turn around and suddenly hit Worth with the boot . then he walk towards leaven . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin you do not want the boot . -------------------------------------------------------------------- then quentin again hit Worth several time . afterwards he open the door in the floor . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin you wanna come with we Worth ? down the hatch . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin throw Worth down the hole in the floor . as Worth hit the floor , he start laugh . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin what the fuck 's with he ? -------------------------------------------------------------------- the other crawl down to Worth . he lie on the door , on the handle . as the camera switch angle , we see a corpse with the face down . quentin turn the corpse with he foot . it 's renne . quentin drop the boot . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin how do he ...? worth ( laugh ) it 's the wren , the old renster . quentin how could ...? worth ( laugh ) we have be go in circle quentin that can not be . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin grab leaven and open a door . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin where be we ? leaven I do not know . quentin where be we ??? leaven you figure it out ! you have not do anything . all you do be freak out ! you murderer ! -------------------------------------------------------------------- leaven start cry . Worth stand up and laugh . quentin sit down . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin you be right Worth . there be no outta here . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin start cry . Kazan come and touch he hair . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin ( cry ) get away from I . -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth stand up . -------------------------------------------------------------------- worth be not renne kill in that room ? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth open the door to be renne be kill . there 's nothing . all we see be black . it 's the edge , the shell . -------------------------------------------------------------------- worth how come there 's nothing out there . quentin you see a edge . worth we be not at the edge before . where 's the room that kill renne ? quentin fuck off ! -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin throw the boot after Worth , but the boot do not he it 's be throw out of the room . -------------------------------------------------------------------- worth oh , that be good . quentin what difference do it make ? we be dead anyways . worth hey ! listen to what I be say ! there be a room there before ! we have not be move in circle , the room have ! leaven of course . quentin the room ? worth that explain the thunder , the shaking . we have be shifting the whole time . leaven it 's the only logical explanation . I be such a idiot . worth what be you on to leaven . leaven give I a minute . the number be marker point on a map , right ? worth right . leaven and how do you map a point that keep move ? worth permutation . -------------------------------------------------------------------- leaven nod . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin permu ... what ? leaven permutation . a list of all the co-ordinate the room pass through . like a map that that tell you where the room start , how many time it move and where it move to . quentin the number tell you all that ? leaven I do not know . I have only be look at one point on the map , which be probably the startingposition . all I see , be how the cube look like before it start to move . quentin ok , so it 's move . how do we get out ? leaven 27 . I know where the exit be . quentin where ? leaven stay away from I . worth back off , quentin ! quentin I just wanna know , do not you wanna know ? leaven you remember that room we pass through before , the one with the co-ordinate larger than 26 ? worth what about it ? leaven that co-ordinate place the room outside the cube . worth a bridge ? leaven right , but only in it 's original position . quentin what be you talk about ? leaven look , the room start off as a bridge , then it move it 's way through the maze , which be where we run into it , but at some point it must return to it 's original position . worth so the bridge be just a bridge ... leaven ... in a short period of time . this thing be like a giant combinationlock , when the room be in they startingposition ht elock be open . but when they move out of the linement the lock close . worth well the size of we ... it must take day to complete a full cycle . quentin so when do it open ? -------------------------------------------------------------------- now we see leaven do some math again . quentin crawl towards she . -------------------------------------------------------------------- leaven do not ! we find it 's original co-ordinate by add the number , the permutation be find by subtracting the number . it 's it . the room move to 0 , 1 and - 1 on the x-axis , 2 , 5 and - 7 on y , and 1 , - 1 and 0 on z. quentin and what do that mean . leaven you suck in math ? ok , I need the roomnumber around as a referencepoint . worth 666 ... 897 ... 466 ... quentin 567 ... 898 ... ok ? leaven yes ! quentin and 545 ... do you get that ? worth 656 ... 778 ... 462 ... leaven that 's enough . X be 17 , y be 25 and z be 14 . which mean this room make two more move before return to it 's original position . worth do we have time ? leaven maybe ... quentin then let 's go . worth can you work out the trap in the system ? quentin fuck the trap , let 's get to the bridge . worth well you throw out we last boot , you fuck idiot . leaven technically I can identify the trap . worth technically ? leaven first I think they be identify by primenumbers , but they be not . they be identify by a number that be the power of a prime . quentin ok , so ? worth can you calculate that ? leaven the number be huge . quentin but you can , right ? you can ? leaven I have to calculate to number of factor in each set . maybe if I have a computer ... quentin you do not need a computer . leaven yes , I do . quentin figure it out ! leaven yes , I do ! quentin I be not die in a fuck ratmaze . leaven look ! no one in the whole world could do it mentally ! look at the number : 567898545 . there 's no way I can factor that . I can not even start on 567 . it 's astronomical ! kazan two ... astronomical . worth what do you say ? kazan astronomical . worth before that ... kazan factor ... leaven how many factor Kazan ? of 567 ? kazan two ... quentin what be you fuck kid ? leaven how many factor do 30 have ? kazan Three ... leaven and seven ? kazan one ... gumdrop . leaven I do not have any gumdrop . kazan gumdrop ! worth Kazan , I will give you a whole box of gumdrop for each answer . kazan gumdrop come in bag . worth you want them in bag , you get them in bag . kazan I do not like the red one . -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth open a door and tell the number to Kazan . -------------------------------------------------------------------- worth 8-9-8. kazan two ... worth 5-4-5. kazan two ... leaven he 's give we the factor . kazan astronomical . quentin you be tell I tell - a - Son boy be a genius . leaven by that number the room should be safe . quentin there 's only one way to find out . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin take Worth and throw he into the room . -------------------------------------------------------------------- leaven do not ! worth safe . quentin Kazan , my man ! -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin try to make Kazan give he the factor . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin what 's the number boy ? right here ! look here ! make he do it . leaven Kazan , we gonna do some number , ok ? we like to do number , right ? kazan primenumbers . leaven that 's right . can you tell I the factor of 656 ? kazan two ... leaven 779 ... kazan two ... leaven 462 ... kazan Three ... leaven clear . quentin move . come on let 's go . you too Worth . move you scuddy ass Worth , I be not through with you yet . leaven open up that door , and get Einstein work on the number . -------------------------------------------------------------------- as quentin have he head in the room , Worth close the door and try to choke quentin . -------------------------------------------------------------------- leaven oh , Jesus ! worth go! hurry ! quentin leaven . leaven 563 ... come on Kazan ... 563 ... quentin you fuckhead , you be dead ! kazan two ... leaven clear ... -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin get he head out , and Worth close the door . next we see the number 384 . -------------------------------------------------------------------- kazan one .. leaven trapped ! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth enter the room and close the door . -------------------------------------------------------------------- worth check the floor . leaven be he dead ? worth not quite . quentin not even close , Worth ! when I be finish I will throw you in a fuck trap on the way out of here . -------------------------------------------------------------------- on the other side of the door , we see quentin open the door . -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin where be he ? come here ! I say come here riiight .......... -------------------------------------------------------------------- quentin fall down in the room under the floor . we see Worth hang down there . afterwards leaven and Kazan help Worth up from there . -------------------------------------------------------------------- worth get ya . that way . -------------------------------------------------------------------- now we see the number 805 -------------------------------------------------------------------- kazan two ... leaven clear . kazan four ... leaven clear . -------------------------------------------------------------------- the next door they open lead they to the edge again . this time there 's much more light out there . -------------------------------------------------------------------- worth oh . -------------------------------------------------------------------- leaven put she head outside the room , and quickly take it back . a room be pass by . when they open the door again , there 's a room there . -------------------------------------------------------------------- worth I guess that prove out theory . the number . -------------------------------------------------------------------- we see two number : 206 911 xxx -------------------------------------------------------------------- kazan four , two , three . leaven clear . -------------------------------------------------------------------- they enter the new room , except Kazan , the room they just come from move away . -------------------------------------------------------------------- leaven / worth kazan !!! -------------------------------------------------------------------- in the background we hear Kazan scream . -------------------------------------------------------------------- leaven listen . he have not move far . worth I be gonna find he . what do you think ? leaven you do not have a lot of life leave . -------------------------------------------------------------------- we see Kazan in a red room . he 's terrify . then we see Worth enter a blue room , then we see leaven step on a piece of glass , the one from she glass . then we see Worth in the ceiling of the red room with Kazan . -------------------------------------------------------------------- worth Kazan ? kazan I do not move . worth yeah , good . erm , you have to climb up here , ok ? kazan I do not like that . -------------------------------------------------------------------- leaven open a door and study the number . -------------------------------------------------------------------- leaven 14 ... 26 ... 14 ... worth get back here right now !!! worth five bag of gumdrop ? kazan 27 bag total . worth 27 bag , deal . leaven come here Worth , this room 's next move take it to the bridge . worth we be come . leaven over here . move it . we do not have much time come on . -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth and Kazan crawl in to leaven 's room . leaven close the door . they just make it , before the room move . as we see the group again , they lie down . -------------------------------------------------------------------- leaven Worth ... worth eaoh , it ' better be it . leaven it should be . worth where ? -------------------------------------------------------------------- leaven open a door , there 's nothing behind it . she close it again . -------------------------------------------------------------------- worth ooh , arh . leaven give I a minute . be patient . so guess what , this be the room we start in . I be right , we should never have move in the first place . -------------------------------------------------------------------- the room start to shake , it 's move . as it stop , leaven open the door . we see a red room . -------------------------------------------------------------------- worth the bridge . kazan Red ... leaven Kazan . kazan 38079 leaven clear !!! -------------------------------------------------------------------- they enter the red room . leaven close the door .
