broken embrace written by pedro almodovar dusk , or night have only barely fallen . a huge clock mark 7:55 p.m . ( the clock belong to some landmark building , to be determine ) . immediately follow , the building go dark . establish shot of the eiffel Tower , light . suddenly , all the light go out . the same thing happen with the granada 's alhambra , Seville 's giralda Tower , the guggenheim at bilbao , the Gate of Alcala . all this well - know architectonic wonder turn dark , abruptly . ( beauty that disappear suddenly , beauty that 's extinguish and envelop we in darkness . ) 1 . harry caine' home . int . night . Harry ( fifty year old ) sit , as if he be wait , without hurry , immobile and patient in he study next to he desk , as if it be the thing keep he company . he be not do anything . he let time take its course . his silence be break by the sound of footstep that come and go . at first we can not see who the footstep belong to , until they stop . in the live room , a few meter from Harry , judit stop . she , too , be shroud in darkness . she look at she wristwatch , the second hand move from leave to right on the watch face . judit ( forty -eight , look young ) breathes , impatient . ( she be dress soberly , in a dignify and practical manner ) . she approach a window that look out onto the street . everything outside be also in darkness . the building in front be just a dark mass . she look to the end of the street . almost all the building visible from the window be dark , the Gate of Alcala in the background be also not light . without turn , she say to Harry : judit the door of Alcala have also darken . Harry be still sit , inert , absorb by he thought . the whole house be in darkness , only the ambient clarity of the night come through the window , curtain draw back . 3 judit head slowly toward the kitchen . on the wall there be a vitra clock , to which she give a cursory glance . she turn on the faucet and fill a glass of water . from she pocket , she remove a tiny heart make of black nacar shell and rimmed in silver . she open it . she grab a small pink pill . she take it . she glance once more at the stylize design of the vitra clock . the minute hand near 8 p.m . on a windowsill ( or on the kitchen table ) there be a open newspaper . the expose page display a article about the danger of global warming . a international date have be conven for a five minute blackout at 8 p.m . stand in the kitchen , judit , poise and tense , look up at the spot where the clock be . the stillness of all the element comprise the frame make it seem like a painting . she wait until the second hand complete its cycle and it 's 8 o'clock sharp . swiftly , judit power the central electrical switchboard , which be in the kitchen . the kitchen light up , the refrigerator emit its characteristic sound . the lamp in the live room also light up . ( low -hanging lamp that make the light bounce . the house be awash in a special luminous atmosphere Â­ dense , translucent , with darken zone ) . all the furniture be flush with the wall . there be some painting hang and a rug on the ground , everything be of the kind of quality that denote good personal taste . upon the light 's return , judit exhales a profound sigh of relief . she move toward the window where she be stand earlier and contemplate how , in the building across the way , the window begin to blink , in square pattern of light . 2 . flashback . 1994 . lanzarote hospital . int . day . 4 the light 's return be contagious , a true spectacle , which end with a blind light that flood the screen . it will probably be a close - up of the sun . that very sun enter through another window , which be not that of Harry 's house , nor that of the building across the way . it be the window of a hospital room ( perhaps a sign should specify that the follow scene occur " fourteen year earlier " ) the hospital be on lanzarote Island , in the canary Islands . the scene occur fourteen year earlier . the character be the same . Harry and judit . Harry lie in bed , he head completely bandage . sunlight enter through the window . judit be seat on the bed . she hold he hand and plead , worried and loving : judit mateo , say something ! mateo -harry mateo be dead . judit ( sweet and devastate ) do not say that ! the character to whom judit refer as mateo , ( the same one that in the previous scene we have call Harry ) , have a recent wound , either on he arm or on he hand , along with he head , which be completely cover by bandage . mateo and Harry be the same person , the difference be the fourteen year that separate they .

I become my pseudonym . ( he apply lotion in front of the mirror , we first see he in front of it , and then , double , reflect in it . then , suddenly , the mirror do not reflect he . of he two identity he only have one leave ) . just as I have plan , a heterodox writer and , never better state , a self - make man , one might even say , " self - write man " . there be only one detail I have not foreseen , Harry would be a blind writer . 6 3 . image that accompany the voice - off . harry caine' DAILY ritual . despite he fifty year and he blindness , Harry be a man that keep himself in great physical shape .

Diego , you do not have to run for I . we be not in a hurry . judit I be , I have commit ... harry you will have it by tonight , do not worry . judit start think of the next script . some kind of horror or fantasy story for bratty teenager . it 's what sell best ... harry I do not know if I will know how to . I be think of develop a story inspire by Arthur Miller 's son ... judit ( perplex ) the writer who marry Marilyn ? harry 17 yes ... after Marilyn he marry the photographer inge morat and they have a son . he be bear mentally handicapped and Arthur Miller hide he ; he do not even mention he in he memoir . he never recognize he publicly . from the moment he be bear , he have he place in a institution and want to hear nothing of he . despite he condition , the boy be able to learn and to make a almost normal life for himself . he live in a apartment with other friend and he find a job as a clerk in a supermarket ... judit look at he perplex . for some reason , Harry have he back turn . this happen many time . judit and Miller never see he ? ... harry ( continue , he back turn ) one day , Miller be give a conference in defense of a mentally retarded man , who have be condemn to death , after what be believe to be a force confession . among that present be he mentally handicapped son , who be integrally involved with organization that aid all sort of disabled people . the son be very proud to finally be share something with he father . at the end of the conference , he approach the stage and hold he in a embrace that must have seem endless to Arthur Miller , who do not know how to extract himself from this mentally handicapped man ; imagine , it would not have be politically correct , least of all give the situation in which Miller find himself . then the stranger let go of he and tell he : " I be 18 you son , Daniel , and I be very proud of you , Father !

Diego stop thumbing through a magazine in order to listen to Harry and to witness he mother 's reaction . she be not ready for Harry to counter with such a shocking narrative . judit ( somewhat tense ) it 's very move , but I do not think we can write a script about Arthur Miller without procure rights from the family . harry we change the name , the story be not about the writer 's miserliness , but about the strength of the son who survive without the least bit of rancor toward the father who have ignore he he entire life . it be a story of trouble overcome and of inherent goodness . there be not that many good man that one can write about . judit would like to say that when she speak of a commercial script this be not what she have in mind , but she do not want to come off rude . Diego keep watch they . her mother appear oddly cornere , until she remember a past comment of Harry 's , that suit she just right : judit it 's a beautiful story . but year ago , when you begin write again and I begin sell you script , you tell I you would never write remake , sequel , nor biopics . nor storey whose protagonist be film 19 director , handicapped or blind . I remember clearly because the part of the biopics surprised I . ( smile ) harry I can not bear they ... ( as if he have at that very moment remember ) it 's true , it 's true I say all that , but this would not exactly be a biopic ... they hear the doorbell ring , two or three time . for judit , it 's the best way to escape the conversation . judit I will get it .
