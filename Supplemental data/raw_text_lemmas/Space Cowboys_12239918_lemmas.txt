space cowboys written by ken kaufman and howard klausner May 1999 draft for educational purpose only manual military typewriter hammer out a screen narration : superimpose : october , 1958 . the successful launch of sputnik I have start rumor that manned space flight be a year away for the Soviet Union . the United States have assume the titanic challenge of " take the high ground of space . " ext . usaf proving ground ( california high desert ) - day a sonic boom in the crystal blue desert sky . a modify Bell lab X -2 ultrasonic jet -- basically a rocket with stubby wing that look more like vestigial fin -- scream upwards , a 80 degree climb into space . on its side be stylishly paint " daedalus . " int . x- jet - close on altimeter - that moment 108,999 feet ... the " 999 's " roll over . the pilot 's voice strain with the G-forces and thin oxygen . pilot ( v.o. ) 109,000 . come on , Frank , let 's poke we nose into space . the pilot be Major william " hawk " hawkins , 26 . in the seat behind he be major frank corvin , 29 . both wear bulky pressure suit and space helmet . frank no . that 's enough , Hawk . we be approach heat barrier . let 's level off . ( into he radio ) recover one , this be falcon . beginning descent now . int . AIR force b- - that moment twelve mile below the X - 2 . barrel - chest , buzz-cutte Captain " tank " sullivan be at the control . tank Roger , daedalus . get you on the scope , Frank . tank sharpen the radar blip . as he do , we see a plastic hula girl on the instrument panel " dance " frenetically . int . x- - that moment the altimeter hit 110,000 . Frank and Hawk be breathe harder . hawk bingo . 110,000th floor , lady ' lingerie . the drone of the rocket motor hesitate -- a nanosecond at most -- then resume as normal . frank you catch that , Hawk ? Hawk be in the zone , listen and feel the airplane . frank Hawk ! ext . desert ground below -- that moment Captain jerry o'neill sit outside a usaf truck in front of a radar screen read a playboy magazine . he read the copy aloud to himself . jerry miss September , herself a promise student pilot , have a particular weakness for structural engineer with Ph.D. 's in astro - physics . he slowly move the playboy away and see a scorpion climb he bare ankle . he roll up the magazine tightly , hold it above the scorpion , ready to swat it . he look at the scorpion ... he look at miss September 's smile face and airbrush - breast ... he can not do it , he can not sully this redhead vision : he calmly grab the scorpion by its stinger tail and fling it . Hawk 's voice crackle over the radio . hawk ( v.o. ) she 's alright , she 's talk to I . you trust I , do not you , Frank ? jerry uh oh ... here we go again . int . x- - that moment through the canopy -- the horizon -- the blue turn to black . Hawk and Frank be touch outer space . hawk Frank , look . the full moon be rise over the curvature of the Earth . hawk ( calm , faraway voice ) that 's where we be go . I do not know how , I do not know when ... Frank look up from the gauge at the horizon . he be mesmerize , speechless . Hawk start to sing . awesome pilot , lousy singer . hawk fly I to the moon and let I play among the star -- Frank look out the window at the moon . the rocket motor hesitate again , sputter and goe silent . all the gauge drop to zero . engine failure . Frank be jolted back to reality . frank Holy God . all we hear be the wind buffete the plane and the eerie sound of the plane 's airframe and body skin creaking . Hawk work frantically to restart the engine , try to joke through it . hawk hey , Frank , wanna get out and gimme a push ? frank sonofabitch ! they be nose over , beginning what every pilot dread most -- a flat spin . the cockpit alarm sound . hawk we have to eject . frank at 112,000 foot ?! be you outta you mind ?! hawk we be not gonna ride this thing out . call mayday -- we be pop ! frank ( gasp for air ) we be not ... lose ... another ... ship ! ext . x- - that moment spin wildly , plummete towards ground . the right wing shudder and rip away -- the plane invert in its spin . int . x- - that moment hawk do not think about it , Frank . just do it . I be gonna count down to one . ready ? one ! Hawk yank the t-handle . the explosive bolt blow the canopy off . two scream , one of terror , one of joy , as they eject , the supersonic wind hit they like a truck . Frank and Hawk be in free fall -- 22 mile over the desert . approach the speed of sound , they scream towards Earth . Frank be paralyze in a still fall . Hawk tumble and soar like he namesake , live every man 's ultimate fantasy -- pure flight . side by side , he seem to taunt Frank as he fly about . Frank pull he rip cord at 22,000 , arrest he fall . Hawk keep right on go . ext . ground - that moment Jerry , binocular train skyward , see Frank 's parachute deploy at exactly the moment he hear the thunder boom of the plane crash into the desert floor , jerry that 's gotta be Frank ... but where 's Hawk ? ext . sky - that moment Hawk be soar , spin , laugh and scream , ignore the ground come up quick . int . b- - that moment tank search through the windscreen for Hawk , when Hawk ! -- a flail flash , really -- free-falls right past the cockpit windshield , startling tank . tank whooa shit !! he bank the huge plane hard leave to avoid hit he . tank grimly take the dance hula girl off the instrument panel , replace she with a plastic dashboard Jesus . ext . sky - hawk one thousand foot -- Mach one plus . sluggish , lethargic , almost out . he will he eye open to see the ground come up mighty fast and pull the cord ; the chute release . a gut - wrenching force nearly yank he out of the harness as he be pull skyward -- 700 mph to zero in three second . he open he face plate , gulp air , laugh like a schoolboy . ext . ground - that moment Jerry laugh , relieved , when he see the second chute . he climb into the truck , toss the playboy aside and start the engine . jerry crazy son of a bitch almost make like a bug on a windshield . Hawk touch down easily . he fall back on he chute , elate . CUT to : ext . edward AIR force base - that moment establish . int . office - day the office of Major bob gerson , Air Force special project administrator . only 27 , gerson already have the look of a polished bureaucrat . he look out the panoramic window behind he desk at a thick , black column of smoke rise above the desert -- obviously the experimental X - 2 . siren audible . his look be neither alarm nor concern . he study the scene coldly and objectively like a scientist . and he eye seem to smile , as though this be no real catastrophe to he . CUT to : ext . desert - that moment as Frank descend , he lift he faceplate and look out at -- a column of black smoke on the horizon -- where the X - 2 crash . Frank touch down -- not quite as graceful or elate as Hawk . matter of fact , he tumble over , catch in the chute and rigging . a look of single - minded revenge on he face , Frank unharness himself and charge toward Hawk awkwardly in he stiff , cumbersome pressure suit . Hawk sit up , howl with joy . hawk 112,000 and I feel fine ! let 's do it again , Frank ! Frank punch Hawk through the open faceplate of he helmet , knock he off he foot . frank you always have to push thing to they limit , do not you ? hawk that 's what I do best , Frank . Frank dive on he , they lock up in a fight . Jerry jump out of the just - arrive truck , and dive into the melee , try to pull they apart . CUT to : int . bob gerson' outer office - later that day Frank enter , literally hat in hand . Hawk follow he in , hat still on he head . Frank swipe it off , shove it into he hand . the duty sergeant open gerson 's door . int . gerson' office - continuous action they enter , gerson face out he panoramic window -- we can still see the smoke from the brush fire cause by the crash of the X - 2 . gerson be that smoke I smell ? look like a fire out by ridgecrest . frank we crash the X - 2 . gerson my four-million dollar X - 2 ? be that the X - 2 you be refer to ? hawk we do break both altitude and speed record , sir . and beat the free fall mark by 30,000 foot . Frank glare at Hawk . gerson Three plane in ten month . that 's bound to be a record , too , hawkins . frank the engine fail . the aircraft go into a flat spin and we could not recover . gerson nod " compassionately . " no doubt that this two despise one another . gerson ( patronize ) but you make it . that 's the important thing . ( glance at he watch ) and you make it just in time , Frank . CUT to : int . PRESS room â€”- moment later cramme with PRESS people and photographer . they snap away , shouting question to gerson at the podium , flanke by team daedalus : Frank , Hawk , Jerry and tank , who smile for the camera . gerson hold up he hand for quiet , and produce a envelope with the presidential seal . gerson gentlemen , I hold in my hand a announcement from the office of the President . ( read the announcement ) ' the United States ' continue involvement in manned space exploration be hereby assign to a new civilian agency , the stration . Project daedalus be now complete , and designate Mission accomplish . he fold up the announcement . Frank be utterly confuse . another reporter ( PRESS ) what about the pilot ? who 's gonna be the first american in space ? gerson turn to Frank , smile . he slap he on the shoulder . gerson the selection have be make . after a exhaustive search we have identify who could best carry out this mission . ( to the team ) this job call for toughness -- physical and mental toughness -- and a ability to follow order to the letter . Frank and Hawk exchange glance , wonder which it will be . neither of they notice a sergeant walk in , hold the hand of ... SAM a three - foot chimpanzee wear a NASA flight suit . gerson gentlemen , meet Sam . the first american to cross into outer space . the chimp grin huge . Frank and the team be open - mouth , in shock . gerson pick he up , smile for the photo -op . the flashbulb and question erupt like a thunderstorm . Sam reach he hand out to Frank . gerson oh , look , Frank . he want to shake you hand . frank you bastard . gerson shake he hand for the camera , Frank . that 's a order . Frank slowly take the chimp 's hand , look as though he might be sick . the camera flash more , blind a already stunne man . ext . johnson space CENTER ( houston ) - day establish . superimpose : the present int . space tracking room - deep in complex - morning if it 's larger than a basketball and it 's orbit the Earth , it be track here . pure NASA . hi- tech , all business . five engineer sit at computer bang away at they keyboard in frustration . astronaut / engineer ethan glance , 34 , push back from the console . ethan usually have the clean - cut swagger of a arrogant , handsome young man with too many letter after he name . today , however , he 's get the dishevel look of a guy who 's be up all night work . ethan it just be not respond . the engineer next to ethan turn to another engineer -- and translate in Russian to she . int . administrative wing - corridor - that moment Engineers and administrator move about , focus , with a purpose . int . office â€”- continuous action the sign on the door identify this as the office of SARA holland , Space shuttle Mission director . thirty - seven , ex-astronaut , focus like a laser beam on anything she pay attention to . right now , she scan a thick computer printout , shaking she head at whatever it 's tell she . the phone ring , she grab it absent - mindedly . SARA Sara Holland . okay , be right there . int . NASA conference room â€”- moment later at the conference table sit Flight director eugene davis ( 60 ) , a avuncular , rotund man . beside he be NASA administrator , a couple of state department official , orbital engineer , Russian engineer from Star City , and the Russian General vostov ( 5as ) . Sara enter , arm full of file and printout . bob gerson , now 67 , quickly rise to meet she . Age have be kind to the retire General - turn - NASA Project director : he at least have the appearance of venerability . 10 . gerson gentlemen , this be Mission director Sara Holland . she 's be closely monitoring the situation and she assure I the problem be well in hand . she look at gerson skeptically . not the politician gerson be , she begin she briefing , speak a no - bullshit scientist 's lingo color with a hint of she Virginia heritage . SARA good morning , gentleman . as you know , 11 day ago atmospheric track determine that Russian communication satellite ikon have initiate orbital degradation . Computer trajectory model predict a steady acceleration in sequence with the gravitational constant . state department official would you mind translate that for all the non - Ph.D. 's , Dr. Holland ? SARA the satellite 's orbit be decaye , and the Earth 's gravity be take over . vostov look particularly agitate . SARA there 's a total system failure in the on-line navigation and guidance avionic . all redundant system be non-responsive . without active course correction in the next 30 to 40 day , the satellite will reenter the atmosphere . gerson look nervously at vostov . vostov and crash ? SARA General , ikon give you fourteen year of service . that be within the performance range of a communication satellite . it will probably crash in the ocean or burn up in the atmosphere . I think it 's best to let it . 11 . vostov stand , address the room conciliatorily . vostov my country be grateful for the effort of NASA and the State Department . however , lose ikon be not a option . ikon be not just a communication satellite to the Russian federation . ikon be the communication satellite . you be undoubtedly aware of we restructure problem . lose all telecommunication until we be able to replace ikon could plunge we into chaos and perhaps even civil war . davis certainly you have other satellite aloft . can not you transfer the workload ? gerson gene , Sara ; we have be give a presidential mandate to assist the Russians ... ( smile at vostov ) ++. we partner in the International Space Station . ( reassuringly to vostov ) we will fix this problem . it 's just a glitch . CUT to : int . hallway - moment later a clearly piss off Sara walk briskly behind gerson down the hallway . SARA you be feed this guy bold - face lie . this be a waste of money and a waste of my staff 's time -- gerson you be a damn fine engineer , Sara , but you do not know shit about politics . helping Russia save face be a act of good faith . you can not put a price on that . gerson stop in front of a door and slide he id key card through the electronic lock . 12 . int . space tracking - control room - continuous action Sara and gerson enter . ethan stare at he computer monitor , exhaust and defeat . the Russian engineer be slump asleep on couch and at they console . ethan this thing 's dumb as a post . it 's dead in the air . gerson forget try to talk to the satellite . you have the code , override the guidance system . ethan point to four technical drawing pin to the wall . ethan you figure that mess out . the guidance system on this thing be a dinosaur . Sara cross to the wall , analyze the technical drawing . ethan ( nodd to sleep Russians ) even this guy do not understand it , it 's pre-microprocessor , it 's pre-everything . whoever design this byzantine piece of shit be probably chopping rock in siberia . SARA ( still stare at drawing ) be there anyone around who remember skylab ? gerson what do that have to do with anything ? SARA you be a damn fine politician , Bob , but you do not know shit about engineering . ( turn to face Bob ) this be the guidance system from skylab . gerson that 's impossible . maybe there be similarity , but they can not be the same . 13 . Sara go to one of the computer , log on . SARA I be look up the designer . gerson do not bother . it be Francis D. corvin . SARA be he dead ? gerson close he eye in dread . gerson only if I be lucky . CUT to : ext . ranch house ( yountville , california ) - day Frank corvin 's ranch house . a old porsche 356 in the driveway . int . garage - door OPEN frank corvin , age 69 , have age well -- strong , fit , and tan if a bit weathered . he stand on a step ladder install a electric garage opener with a cordless drill . he 's lose he patience , cussing under and over he breath as he wife barbara , a attractive , long - gray - haire woman of 65 refer to -- instruction which show the bearded assistant from " Home improvement " grin as he easily install the device . barbara would you like I to read you the instruction again -- ? Frank cut she off with the loud cordless drill at maximum revs . the final screw screw in , he press a button on the unit . the garage door go down , smooth , perfect , the time light go on . frank let I explain something , darlin' . job do , he step down from the ladder , victory on he face . 14. frank that instruction be write by a japanese fella in Japan where they make the damn thing . then they have some expatriate american , live in Japan because he can not get a job in the U.S. , translate they . then , since it 's Japan and they be wary of foreigner , they get a japanese fella to edit the american guy who translate the japanese guy . he grin smugly , take the instruction from she , tear they in half . the time light click off ; it 's pitch black inside the garage . we hear he fumble for the remote , and press the button . nothing . he press it again . nothing . barbara you know the door to the house be lock , right ? frank it 's just the security code . he pop the back off the remote -- frank or the battery ... barbara you forget the battery ? frank ( romantic ) well , look like it 's just you and I , in a dark place , the smell of gasoline and fertilizer in the air ... he fumble about , advance on she . the ladder fall . she laugh , and " scream " for help . barbara help ! I be lock in a smelly garage with a dirty old man ! he stub he toe , cuss . and laugh . she give in , they start to make out . the garage door suddenly hum to life and open , casting the daylight on they mid-embrace , revealing -- SARA and ethan stand in front of Frank 's porsche , a beige government sedan behind it . ethan hold a identical remote . 15 . ethan Mr. corvin ? frank Doctor corvin . ethan Excuse I -- Doctor corvin . be I interrupt something ? the question be too stupid to even answer . Sara shoot he a look . SARA Doctor corvin . I be Sara Holland , and this be astronaut ethan glance . we be with NASA . Frank eye they suspiciously , look at the remote control in ethan 's hand . ethan it be in you car . I hear someone scream . frank thanks for save the day . now what do you want ? ethan could we have a minute of you time ? frank you should have call first . I be a very busy man . Barbara stifles a giggle . Frank send she a dirty look . SARA Dr. corvin , in thirty - five day a satellite with you guidance system on board be go to be - enter the atmosphere . the system be non-responsive . want to take a crack at it ? CUT to : int . franks dine room - moment later ethan have spread the technical drawing on the dining table . they all drink glass of iced tea . Frank slowly crunch he ice as he study the drawing . this clearly send shiver down ethan 's spine , and Frank know it . 16 . ethan there seem to be a interruption in the path here , but the circuitry be still operational . it 's send we data -- frank you have lose you uplink . ethan it have to be a problem in the manual rout drive here . frank I do not think so . ethan that 's the consensus among the engineer . frank the same engineer that send you here ? he crunch he ice for emphasis . ethan wince . frank do that bother you ? ethan yes , it do , actually . crunch . SARA you design pre-date all exist guidance system . it be ahead of its time in ' 69 , but this technology be obsolete now . none of the current engineer speak this language , and the older guy be ... she trail off , the conclusion clear -- they be all dead . frank it be not design for this duration of duty . it be design for SkyLab . my advice to you be capture the satellite and bring it home . ethan it 's too big . frank for the space shuttle ? what kind of bird be it ? SARA it 's a Russian communication satellite . frank what the hell 's my guidance system do onboard a Russian satellite ? ethan that 's really not we primary concern at this time . frank ( Frank really hate he now ) where 's it orbit , or be that not a primary concern either ? SARA one thousand mile . frank rate of decay ? SARA 8000 meter per day . and accelerate . frank you be right about one thing ; that bird 's come home . five week at the most . SARA NASA 's calculation agree . but here we be . Doctor , you design this system . if anyone can solve this , it 's you . Frank chomp he ice , size up both of they . frank for a moment there , I be think you two might be a couple of Bob gerson 's lackey . frank ( cont 'd ) but judge by you command of the fact of history , I see that 's impossible . he 's be take credit for that since I work it out in ' 58 , the year he replace my ass with a monkey . his blood pressure 's rise . he keep he gaze on Sara , see she look uncomfortable . 18 . frank you do not work for Bob , do you ? SARA he 's a Project manager at NASA . he 's one of many people assign to this problem . Frank nod , unmove . frank I will have to ask you both to leave . ethan Dr. corvin , you country need you . frank stick a sock in it , son . I have hear it all before . you can not solve this problem from here , and you will never get a crew up to speed on it in time . you bird 's dead , let she die . my only hope be that what do not disintegrate during re-entry land on Bob gerson 's house . Frank 's rage boil right under the surface . Barbara watch from the kitchen . frank but before you go , let I offer you both some career advice . get as far from that son of a bitch as humanly possible . ethan roll up the draw . ethan apparently the buzz on you be correct . frank and what buzz be that ? ethan you be not a team player . that 's why you wash out at NASA . frank get the hell out of my house ! ethan exit hurriedly . Sara take she time . there 's disappointment , but respect on she face . she exit . Frank 's face be flushed red , he eye angry slit , tooth 19 . clench . barbara we have to brush up on you hospitality skill . int . corvins ' kitchen - that night silence at the dinner table . Frank be still seethe . barbara you know what the problem with that satellite be , do not you . Frank snort , butter a roll . he obviously do . barbara you could fix it . probably ina day . right ? frank I will not crawl back for another beat . gerson make he bed , let he lie in it . Barbara . it 's a old satellite , a Russian one at that . it will burn up on re-entry and they will build another one . barbara Frank ... Barbara watch he leave , hate to see he like this . int . franks garage - late night Frank take the original draw of the guidance system out of a tube and spread it across he draft table . he blow the dust off it . he study it , casually eat ice cream . the look on he face tell we the problem be obvious . his eye travel up to -- group photo on wall team daedalus in the ' 5as : Frank , Hawk , Jerry , tank and a few other guy pose in front of the X - 2 jet pre - crash . full of youthful vigor , they dream still alive , eye on the prize of space . back to frank stare at the picture . his eye be misty ; it 's as if old dream freeze inside he have begin to thaw . like a 20 . child , he lick the vanilla ice cream moustache off he upper lip . ext . johnson space CENTER ( houston ) - day establishing . int . SARA holland office - day Sara look up from a classified Air Force file entitle " Project daedalus . " Frank corvin stand at she door , wear he crack leather Air Force jacket and jeans , chew gum . frank I have a solution to you problem . CUT to : int . bob gerson' office - upstair the door open . gerson look up , see Sara bring Frank in , cover he disdain with a insincere smile . gerson Frank corvin . how long 's it be ? frank not long enough , Bob . gerson ( laugh ) have not lose that corvin charm , have we ? coffee ? Frank nod . gerson go to the credenza and pour a cup . gerson Sara tell I you be up to speed on we little problem . we have get one sick bird . ( pointedly ) apparently there 's a flaw in the guidance system . he hand Frank he coffee . Frank smile at he jab . frank that 's a helluva way to get the designer of that system to help you out . gerson well , I hear about you initial 21 . response . do not worry , I be sure we will come up with something . SARA Dr. corvin be here with a solution . gerson well praise the Lord , we be deliver ! let 's hear this solution , Frank . Frank 's delivery be as nonchalant as possible . frank send my team up . we will fix you break satellite . both gerson and Sara look incredulous . a eternity pass . Frank fill the silence with a loud slurp of coffee . frank you make a damn good cup of coffee , Bob . gerson you want to run that by I again ? frank team daedalus . Hawk , tank , Jerry and I . send we up . gerson this be a joke , right ? Frank grin impishly , shake he head no . Sara resist smile . frank we train five year for a space mission . gerson how old be you , Frank ? frank Old enough to know you ass be in a sling . gerson Sara , would you excuse we ? this be fast become a personal matter . enjoy this , Sara reluctantly exit . 22. frank you be out of option . I know that because I be the last person you would come to for help . gerson you get that right . frank you satellite come down in thirty - four day . it 's too big to retrieve . it 's too important to let crash . I design that guidance system . I be the only one who can fix it . gerson I do not know how to break this to you , Frank . but you be a old man . frank well , this old man' all you get . you know it , I know it . besides , you let Glenn go up at 77 . there 's the offer . I will be hearing from you . Frank stand , turn to leave . gerson shout after he . gerson you become a senior citizen five year ago ! Frank stop , turn around with a care - to-differ look . frank four . gerson for once in you life , be a team player . train the crew if you like , but let the professional at NASA fix the design flaw . frank ( get angry ) there be not any design flaw . how it end up in a Russian bird in the middle of the cold war -- that 's the only flaw I see . how do that happen , Bob ? gerson squirm . frank this be a hand - on job , and there 's no way I can train anyone in this time - frame . my offer 's on 23 . the table . I and the team . take it or leave it . he turn to leave again , walk to the door . gerson you -- as a technical advisor , maybe . but I can not fill a space shuttle with geriatrics . you be professional enough to know that ! half that guy be probably dead anyway ! Frank open the door , and without look back , walk out . frank ( 0.s. ) the clock 's tick , Bob . and I be only get older . int . johnson space CENTER - entry hall - moment later Frank stride confidently to the front door . he 's chase by a security guard , who grab he . Frank push the man off he and keep on walk . security Mr. gerson would like you to wait here . Frank stop , turn around . gerson exit a elevator and walk briskly towards he . Frank grin confidently , hand in the pocket of he leather flight jacket . gerson alright . it 's a deal . he stick out he hand . Frank look at it , do not take it . frank I want it in write . gerson okay . but here be the term : you and every member of you team have to pass the same physical requirement as any other astronaut here . if one of you fail , none of you go up . ( as Frank think , nod ) and just to insure this be not a total exercise in futility , you will train to fix that guidance system side - by-side with my people in case you man do not pass , which 24 . be a distinct possibility . frank that 's fair . gerson I can not tell you how much I be go to enjoy watch you make a complete ass out of yourself . Frank stick out he hand , and they shake . Frank grin . frank ( sarcastic ) it 's great to be work with you again , Bob . Frank walk off . gerson shake he head . CUT to : int . america baptist church ( oklahoma CITY ) - sunday morning the reverend Sullivan ( tank ) pause in he sermon -- puzzle over he note . a youngish 67 , he flow robe can not hide he barrel - chest and Air Force tattoo on he wrist of a winge skull with a bloody dagger between its tooth . tank be thoroughly lose , desperately try to find he place , page fall off the lectern . tank Roman , uh ... chronicle ... ah yes ! the sparse congregation wait in catatonic silence . a old man , drool on he chin , jolt awake from he wife 's elbow in he rib . sitting in the back of the church be Frank , barely contain he laughter at tank 's awkwardness in the pulpit . tank ' and in the fortieth year , amariah begat Zadok , who begat libni , the brother of uzziah . ' no ... that 's not it , either . sigh from the congregation . tank 's lose they . he look down at the face of the lectern at -- the hula girl we see in he B - 50 in ' 58 . keeps it there for good luck , and for moment like this . tank once upon a time , four of the best pilot in the Air Force train to fly into space . they fly at the 25 . speed of sound to the very top of the sky , cheating death as they freefall from twenty mile high . the church be waking up now -- they apparently love this old war storey from reverend tank . int . back of church - moment later the recessional music thunder as the congregation dismiss . Frank wait , smile , at the end of the receive line . tank see he , and grab he up ina bear hug . tank boss . ( look up to the heaven ) sorry . my former boss . frank I bring glad tiding , reverend tank . they go by the name of daedalus . there appear to be a resurrection after all . int . tank's office - moment later Pilot picture among the seminary book . Frank reach up and take down a photo of team daedalus . tank remove he robe , shaking he head in disbelief . tank I do not know , Frank . that 's a complicated proposition . I have a flock . I have grandchild . frank they will be here when you get back . besides , you be bound to be able to milk this for three or four sermon . tank I need to pray about this . frank can you pray quick ? tank wait ... wait a moment , my stiff - neck brother ...

' CUT to : ext . amusement park ( california ) - day the park be under construction , empty except for crane and crew assemble roller coaster . one of the roller coaster be completely build , and a single car ride around the track . int . roller coaster car Riding alone in the car be Jerry o'neill . slight of build , a few wrinkle , a bad jet-black toupee under he baseball cap ; at 68 he have become a swinging bachelor out of touch with the time . he grin ear to ear as he talk into a micro-cassette recorder . jerry let 's kick this apogee up about 15 percent -- whoaa ! second bank 's too fast , some little johnny 's gonna pass out on we ... drop ita G go into third loop . ( go upside down ) Little more of a sine wave feel here ... not so flat . stand at the bottom of the roller coaster be several technician and a pretty young woman about thirty , watch Jerry , smile . Frank walk up to she as he watch Jerry go around . he seem to know she . frank thirty -five year design supersonic aircraft for the military . now he 's building roller coaster . perfect . ( laugh at the irony ) you father 's a gift man . the Young woman look at Frank , do not recognize he . pretty young woman oh , he 's gift , alright . the roller coaster come in . Jerry get out and hug the 27 . Young woman , give she a prolong kiss that be anything but paternal . he see Frank laugh to himself . jerry Frank corvin ! what be you do here ? frank just wonder if you be busy for the next month and a half . Jerry toss he tape recorder to one of the technician . frank NASA want to send we into space . Jerry examine Frank , lean in and tilting he head like Frank be crazy . he look concerned . jerry I wonder who would be the first . forty -year- old memory be sharp as the day they happen but you can not for the life of you remember what you have for breakfast . ( pause , loudly ) what do you have for breakfast , Frank ? frank vegetarian huevo rancheros and some kind of flavor decaf cappuccino that taste like it be filter through a jock strap . Jerry smile -- he old friend be okay . jerry Frank ! Frank proudly show a copy of the NASA contract to Jerry . Jerry take out a pair of very thick - lense glass ( ' 80s porsche frame ) and put they on . Frank 's look of pride turn to one of worry as he see Jerry 's thick glass . frank you need that ? jerry ( without irony ) naah . they be just for read ... drive ... see movie ... walk .

Frank pull ethan out of he mmu . int . mission control - moment later all rapt by the sight on screen -- Hawk set the payload assist module , talk to tank. 114 . tank pitch should be set at 060 degree . hawk ( v.o. ) Roger , 060 . int . crew cabin - that moment the airlock door open . Frank float into the cabin from the airlock , hold ethan . Jerry be in Frank 's face immediately . jerry you can not let he do this . there 's gotta be another way ! frank there be not . I will explain later . ( beat ) what 's we status here ? jerry ( shocked at Frank ) the orbital maneuver engine be destroy in the fire . Computer guidance be go , and we lose a few heat tile . frank how 's Roger ? jerry concussion . ( hesitates ) he 's out of action , Frank . you be gonna have to pilot this bird in . Frank swallow hard . he look over at tank . tank do not look at I . I have not fly anything bigger than a cessna in thirty year . they hear Hawk 's rich laughter over the radio . ext . shuttle - hawk climb into ethan 's vacant mmu , strap in , still laugh . the moon hang overhead , feel so close you could reach out and grab it . hawk ( laugh ) hey , Frank , it 's start to look 115 . like I get the better end of this deal . frank ( v.0 . ) quit laugh , you dummy . you be use up oxygen . hawk alright . let 's shoot this baby to the moon ! int . shuttle - on frank he flick up a safety guard on a control panel and hover he finger over a trigger . a poignant , sardonic grin overcome he . frank I be gonna countdown to one . frank and hawk ( v.o. ) one ! Frank hit the button . a bright light -- the p.a.m. ignite . the satellite begin to quake , then streak away . ext . space Hawk 's head arc back as he and the satellite accelerate to the moon , which be loom large ahead . Hawk 's war whoop can barely be hear over the roar of the engine . he make course correction with pulse from the nitrogen jet . on space shuttle - that moment pin-drop silence . Frank watch through the window . Hawk get smaller , head right for the moon . the pam burn out ( normal ) . quiet .... then -- hawk ( v.o. ) ( sing , over radio ) fly I to the moon and let I play among the star ... static crackle as he voice transmission get weaker . dissolve to : int . mission control - am Sara watch the trajectory screen at the front of the room . drain -- exhaust mentally and physically . the 116 . situation be serious . Davis come out of a huddle with flight controller , and motion Sara to join he at a unoccupy station . davis ikon have leave we gravitational field . Hawk be able to launch the missile into deep space . she nod slowly , a tear swell up in she eye . SARA how 's daedalus ? davis she 's a damage ship . they be gonna have to reenter the atmosphere , find the correct glide slope , and put she down with no power and no computer . SARA that 's impossible . davis well , it 's never be do . the only two pilot alive that could even think about it be Roger and Hawk . Roger 's wounded and Hawk 's ... Sara shut down emotion and be all business now . SARA let 's get they in as close as we can and abort the landing . they ' 1l have to bail out . what 's the survival probability ? davis twenty percent . at best . but it 's zero if they try to set she down . the ship 's dead . she might not even glide with the structural damage . SARA twenty 's better than zero . she place she headset back on , go back to work . CUT to : int . space shuttle daedalus - later the man go about preparation for reentry in silence . full pressure suit , attach to they parachute . Frank 117 . ease the injure Roger into he , tank help ethan . both be helpless , look like child be dress by a parent . tank and Jerry retract the drag chute arm that will deploy under the shuttle 's wing to release they when they jump . int . shuttle - cockpit Frank sit at the control , warning light blink everywhere , read a thick operation manual . tank make he way up . tank you all right ? Frank nod . tank look compassionate . tank you gonna be able to do this ? frank I do not know . I never imagine have to without Hawk . he exhales a big sigh . tank reach into he pocket , pull out ... hula girl from the dash of he B - 50 in 1958 . he stick it on the instrument display panel , and she start to dance . Frank look at tank like he 's crazy . frank you save that thing ? capcom ( v.o. ) daedalus . stand by for Eugene Davis . davis ( v.o. ) Frank , the judgement here be to go for California . we be gonna get you as close as we can to Edwards . now you be still invert . and you be fly tail first . ordinarily , we would do a de-orbit burn to right she -- frank -- but we do not have a engine to do that with . 118 . davis ( v.0 . ) you be gonna have to jostle she a little -- bring she around with you speed and a little gravity . go easy , though . you be still at 17,000 mile per hour . Frank ease the stick over and around . she 's not very responsive . he give it a pull , and the ship snap -roll , and begin shaking violently . frank whoaaaa , shit ! davis ( v.o. ) easy , Frank . she 's not a fighter jet . Frank tap on the rudder pedal and pull hard on the stick until the horizon change . Earth be below he now , instead of over he head . he let out the breath he 's be hold . frank okay , we be righted . int . mission control not a small amount of shock on the face . Davis let out the breath he be hold . davis that 's a good start . intercut with Frank . Frank look at the altimeter -- 400,000 foot . frank Houston , we be at entry interface . davis Roger , Frank . you be gonna punch in here in 15 second . I be gonna lose you till you hit the stratosphere . Frank , you have shed some tile . she 's gonna heat up on you . frank Roger , Houston . davis 10 second . Frank , you have get the procedure . it 's not optimum , but I want all you guy home . 119 . understood ? frank we copy . daedalus out . davis good luck , Frank . ( to engineer ) okay , folk . here we go . int . shuttle - that moment Frank grab the stick , glance over at tank . frank you wanna pray now , rev? tank what the hell you think I have be do ? tank see the worry and concentration in Frank 's face and smile . tank what would Hawk do ? Frank shake he head . he 's not Hawk . the shuttle begin to bounce , enter we atmosphere . and heat up . with no orbital maneuver engine , they be come in more than 50 percent faster than they should . and the ride be about 100 percent more bumpy . Frank talk into he communicator . his voice shaking from the turbulence ... at the very least . frank it 's gonna be a very steep dive so we do not overshoot . I be gonna have to pull a couple very tight turn to slow she down -- last one at 13,000 . at ten , we will be over California . I want everybody up and clipped then . I be blow the hatch at 5,000 and out we go . ethan and Roger first , make sure they clear the wing . everybody get that ? they all affirm . and Frank push the nose over into a steep dive . daedalus groans in response . her airframe be not design for this . ext . shuttle - that moment tile flake away , she 's heating up to 2,000 degree . 120 . int . shuttle â€”- that moment agony in the face . the ship bounce wildly , anything not lock down in steel fly about the cabin . the hula girl dance madly . frank come on , baby . hold it together . Frank 's knuckle be white , hold the stick , jam the unresponsive rudder . first turn , over Japan , 50 mile up . she 's heating up to 2500 now . and they be feel it inside , the man sweat like crazy . the airframe be screeching in protest . roger that 's too steep , Frank ! gonna fall apart on you ! she 's int . mission control - that moment they track the ship , unable to communicate . trajectory engineer altitude 30 mile , over guam . ext . shuttle - that moment the skin 's over 3000 now , the leave wing shaking its rivet . int . shuttle â€”- that moment it 's a oven . Frank have to wipe the sweat away from he eye to see . he try to level off , but she will not respond . he fight , and curse it . nothing . he stop , think , what would Hawk do ? Â«+ . then throw the stick over -- a major , and unnatural bank . then bank it right back across , zig - zag to slow it down . ethan scream in protest , at the same pitch as the bending metal . but Roger nod . this will work . Frank pull one last time , and they bank into they turn , head south , over Hawaii . frank that 's it , baby . one more turn . come on , line I up . line I up ... Frank battle with the stick like the Old man and the Sea fight the great Fish . his face show a warrior 's 121 . calm . the ship level off at 10 mile , shaking and rattling like a ' 55 chevy on a dirt road , and turn for home . and Frank 's agonize grimace ease . int . mission control - that moment burst of static . capcom he 's try to call , sir . davis he 's fry he antenna . trajectory , where be he ? trajectory he 's on final . but he be way too hot . he 's gonna overshoot to Colorado at this rate . int . shuttle - that moment the moment of calm be go . tank 35,000 . we be go way too fast . look ahead , cloud and marine layer at the California coast . tank we can not bail out at Mach 2 , Frank . frank I be glide at 22 degree . we can slow down some , but the most we can hope for be Mach 1 . that , or we go in 1,000 mile past . tank you call . the decision . the shuttle feel like it could break up at any moment . the cloud cover loom ahead as they drop rapidly . tank come up on 10 . frank everybody up ! hook on ! he begin to weave the shuttle in long back and forth 122 . turn -- try to slow she down . mission control - that moment horror on the face . davis no , Frank , no ... shuttle - that moment 7,000 foot . in the cloud . Mach 1. frank stand by . okay , tank. clip on . tank what about you ? frank I just need a visual so I can line she up on death Valley , and I be out . blow the hatch ! he throw a switch , the explosive bolt blow , and the 600 mph wind howl through daedalus . in crew cabin Jerry muscle the drag chute arm into place , and clip Roger in . jerry you ready ? roger yeah . Jerry lift he up , and shove he out on the arm , keep he clear of the wobble wing . jerry one go ! Jerry shove ethan forward , smile as he let he fly . jerry two go ! and the cloud dissolve beneath they . look back , they can see two chute open , float gently down . frank get out now ! 123. look ahead , Frank can see they be too high for Edwards , too low to overshoot a desert oasis community of tract home in the distance . the shuttle be on the line to crash right into it . Frank 's decision be instantaneous . he 's stay with it . he turn around to see Jerry and tank , pause at the hatchway . frank what the hell be you wait for ? they unclip simultaneously . jerry we be a team , Frank . frank go , dammit ! that 's a order ! tank we be stay . Frank throw the stick over , plunging they down . whatever momentum he lose , he 's get it all back now . a normal 22 degree descent be now 50 . they be head in like a missile . frank airspeed ? tank 500 ! pull it up ! Frank hold the dive , see -- two fighter escort on either side . fighter ( v.o. ) daedalus , this be recover five . you be way too hot . recommend abort -- abort now ! Frank level it off . frank negative , recover . I be take she in . tank 410 . here come the runway . frank no problem ... 124 . just like Hawk in the simulator , he hum to himself , totally in he element , a look of peace overcome he . frank Â«+. you just gotta tap the brake . int . AIR force F - - that moment the pilot watch in disbelief as the shuttle 's nose pitch up . pilot shit , he 's lose it ! mayday , mayday !! int . shuttle â€”- that moment the stall alarm be wailing . the leave wing be about to go . frank call my airspeed . tank 350 , 310 , 280 -- she 's stalling , Frank ! you be gonna go over ! Drop the nose ! frank speed ! ? tank 215 ! Drop the nose ! frank whattaya say we drop the nose ? 10 , 5 , 2 , 1 ... touchdown . she 's wobbly , bounce , lean hard right with the damage leave wing . Frank stamp on the brake as the drag chute open -- and she level off , a landing almost identical to Hawk 's in the simulator . int . mission control ( houston ) watch the shuttle roll gently to a stop at the far end of the runway . Barbara watch nervously . frank ( v.o. ) wheel stop . daedalus be home . they rise as one , cheer wildly . Barbara burst out cry . Sara grab the woman and hold she tight . Davis sigh . 125 . davis I be get too old for this shit . on gerson he hesitates for a moment , then force a smile and clap he hand disingenuously . back to scene the media rush back into the room . Davis make he way through the room shaking hand . he see Sara stare at the screen , cry . he head for she . Sara put a arm on he shoulder . SARA gene ? davis yeah ? SARA never mind ... ( as Davis look back at the screen ) you think it 's too late for I to re-join the program ... as a astronaut ? davis ( modd at the big screen ) that oughtta answer you question . she smile . something catch Davis 's eye , he turn to see gerson talk to a news crew . gerson I never doubted Frank for a minute . I bring Frank on to Project daedalus forty year ago , and I bring he in for this mission , and I can tell you this ... ext . desert - mile behind a navy ch - 54 rescue helicopter ease down . two rescue personnel bound out to assist ethan and Roger -- shake , but stand . int . shuttle â€”- that moment 126 . Frank turn to look at Jerry and tank . jerry just a walk in the park , Frank . frank slump back , close he eye . open he eye slowly , he see the only thing move in the shuttle -- franks Pov - hula girl her crazy jig slowly come to a end . dissolve to : angle on full moon - night the sound of cricket in the night . ext . franks house ( yountville , CA ) - night Frank stare at the moon , deep in think . he do not notice Barbara join he at he side . barbara you think he make it ? Frank slowly break into a pensive grin as " fly I to the moon " fade slowly up . frank yeah . I think he make it . his eye travel back to the moon . ext . moon - sea of tranquility - that moment we be moving in toward the moon , slowly , the shadow contour of the sand dune and crater get sharper . sinatra's voice kick in . something pass we -- satellite ikon and as it pass , we see Hawk still attach to it in he mmu . the satellite gently hit the edge of a sand dune , the soft surface cushion the impact . the satellite bounce once , throw -- hawk out of the mmu . 127 . satellite spin , topple over and land back on the moon . hawk arc and tumble through the air until the moon 's gravity gently pull he back down , on to the deep , pillow - soft moon dust , where he bounce once , then lay motionless . tight on hawk' faceplate the Earth be reflect , and we can not see he face , can not tell whether he 's alive or dead . then , in voice over we hear hawk' joyous laughter . wider - hawk lying there , flat on he back . there be a deep impression around he in the lunar dust where he fall , especially around he arm and leg . maybe it be the fall . or maybe , like a kid at Winter 's first snow fall , he be make angel in the virgin snow . fade out . the end
