spider -man screenplay by Ted newsom and John brancato base on character create by Stan Lee first draft November 24,1985 for cannon film 6464 sunset boulevard Los Angeles , CA 90028 int . basement - day a single glistening strand of a spider 's web bisect the black frame . as classical music caress our ear , we see the strand criss - crossing other in a perfect orb web . a spider -- black with a intricate pattern -- drop into frame . it gracefully gather and weave the strand together . the web and spider become small , a gray mass against a basement ceiling corner . the further back we go , the grimier the scene become : peel industrial green paint , tangles of pipe and electrical cable , harsh lighting . we hear a low whir , the pitch grow higher -- a cyclotron . the colossal donut - shape accelerator dominate the basement lab . it 's a cylindrical , metallic tube , suspend from the ceiling , with wire and fixture over its length . utilitarian , a patchwork of technology from the 40s to the 80s , with radioactivity warning . int . experimental chamber - day a steel and glass chamber be built around and below a section of the cyclotron . metal shelve of equipment , a large electrical transformer with heavy cable leading to it from the floor . a three - finger mechanical claw - - a '' waldo '' -- thrust into frame . its telescoping arm extend , lift a tiny one - gram cylinder from a rack of standard weight on a shelf . another waldo hold a lead canister , a third remove a seal vial contain a thick , muddy liquid . a fourth arm reach up to adjust a crystal focus cone , which jut out from the cyclotron tube . the arm aim the cone at a digital scale on a table in the center of the room . the four waldo be mount on a panel with a thick , clear pane above it . through the glass , a shadowy figure manipulate the control . a fibrous blue - white beam erupt from the cone , focus on the weight & the title end . int . control room - day the whir be muffled now , the music loud from a stereo in the control room . a video monitor show a waldo placing the gram weight on a scale ; a digital read - out beside the screen jump from 0.000000 to 1.000000 . a computer screen display irregular , colored pattern describe the downward arc of sub - atomic particle . a digital clock : 8:57 am . a half -eaten chili dog lie on the control panel . dr . otto octavius ( '' doc ock '' ) manipulate the waldo control . in he 5as , ock be broad , thickly - feature , brood , with unfashionably long hair . he wear a stain sweatshirt , protective goggle . without interrupt he concentration , he light a fresh cigarette from the butt of the last , and take a bite of the chili dog . int . basement hallway - day alexander thorkel and solomon rosomoff ( roz ) enter from a flight of stair . tall , thin , 40 , thorkel wear horn -rimmed glass and a brooks brother suit . roz , a professor of astrophysics , walk spryly despite he 75 year . the men head to the door at the end of the hall : '' cyclotron , authorized personnel only . '' thorkel I be sorry to bother you , Professor . but the man be impossible . roz he have he reason , thorkel . at the moment , he have something to prove . thorkel he refuse to open the door . roz maybe he do not hear you knock . thorkel snort . roz fish a card - key from he tweed , insert it into the lock . int . control room - day the door buzy OPEN . thorkel you will be late for class , Dr. octavius . roz sigh . ock do not turn around . thorkel snap the music off . thorkel the University pay you to teach . ock twist a dial , the whir increase in pitch , the light grow more intense . thorkel frown . ock notice roz -- a look of understanding between they . roz otto , I do not like thorkel any more than you do . but he have get a point . ock rosomoff , I have better thing to do than teach introductory physics to mindless adolescent . roz perhaps . but every now and then someone pay attention . you do . thorkel look at he watch . ock sigh and snap a switch . int . experimental chamber - day the four waldos pull backward and hang limply . the whir wind down . ext . 7th avenue - day the diesel engine of a bus wind down as it pull up . the door hiss OPEN . sneakered feet bound down the bus step into frame , onto the sidewalk . the young man in the sneaker , peter parker , pass a bank clock that read 9:02 . intelligent , 20 , with dark hair and rimless glass , peter be neither a nerd nor a male model . drably dressed in jeans and a button - down shirt , he carry a book - filled backpack over one shoulder , a styrofoam cup of coffee in the opposite hand . yawning , he hurrie down the avenue . ext . greenwich village STREET - day peter head down a side STREET toward a institutional build . a sign read : '' curtis connor science CENTER , '' and below , '' empire state university .

'' chip and norb break up laugh . student pour out of a classroom behind they . flash hey ! this be the truth ! look , Doc ock have this , uh , experiment thing , and the Science Center crash into Central Park , and -- he spot Peter and Harry , hold up the bugle . flash parker , osborn -- true , be I right ? peter ( bemuse ) oh , of course . harry I be there . flash see ? harry ( wild - eye ) or be it all a dream ? Peter and Harry laugh and head out the door . ext . lecture hall - day they walk out and past the boarded - off pit that be the science CENTER . harry oh , I need you note from the class I miss . peter well , I have miss a lot of class myself â€¦ . harry oh . well , hang in there , amigo . he cross away . roz catch up to Peter from the lecture hall . roz Peter -- I be so very proud of you .
