( the cop nod and go , and the Lieutenant growl as he turn back to klaatu and the detective ) look like everybody 's goin ' nut . klaatu ( appal by what he have see and hear ) they would have kill this man ? lieutenant ( gruffly ) people get hysterical enough , they do anything .

Captain and klaatu enter the front door , which be hold open for then by hilda . she gesture they toward the half - open door of barnhardt 's study , where barnhardt can be see puzzle over the problem on the blackboard . the Captain knock on the open door to attract he attention and enter with klaatu . int . barnhardt's study barnhardt turn from he deep preoccupation at the blackboard , chalk in hand . m.p. captain this be the man you want to see , Professor . barnhardt ( study klaatu curiously ) thank you , Captain . m.p. captain I will wait outside . he step out into the hall , close the door . barnhardt continue to study klaatu for a moment , then point to the notation he make on the blackboard . there be a control but anxious excitement in barnhardt 's attitude . barnhardt you write this ? klaatu ( nodd easily ) it be a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you be a difficult man to see . ( glance at the blackboard reproachfully ) I think you would have the solution by this time . barnhardt not yet . that 's why I want to see you . klaatu glance at the work barnhardt have be do on the board . then he point to one of the expression in a equation . klaatu all you have to do now be substitute this expression -- ( point to a specific place ) -- at this point . impress and interested , barnhardt tug at he chin as he study and weigh the result . barnhardt ( slowly , thoughtfully ) yes -- that will reproduce the first - order term . but what about the effect of the other term ? klaatu almost negligible ... with variation of parameter , this be the answer . barnhardt how can you be so sure ? have you test this theory ? klaatu ( with a slight smile ) I find it work well enough to get I from one planet to another . ( barnhardt stare at he blankly ) I understand you have call a meeting to study we space ship . barnhardt as though unsure of what he 's hear ) yes -- yes , I have . klaatu my name be klaatu . ( note that barnhardt 's expression be change from amazement to incredulity ) I spend two day at you walter reed Hospital . room 309 . my doctor 's name be Major White -- and I have a very attractive nurse call Ruth , who 's get marry next Wednesday . ( klaatu wait for this to sink in , then speak with quiet authority ) if you be not interested -- or if you intend to turn I over to you Army -- we need not waste any more time . barnhardt hesitates for a long , thoughtful moment . then he go to the door , open it and speak to the Captain outside . barnhardt ( to the Captain , he voice a little unsteady ) you can go now , Captain . please thank General cutler and tell he -- tell he that I know this gentleman . barnhardt close the door and turn to find klaatu watch he with a faint smile . barnhardt sink into a chair , try to adjust he mind . klaatu ( dryly ) you have faith , Professor barnhardt barnhardt it be not faith that make good science , Mr. klaatu . its curiosity . ( unable to conceal he interest ) sit down , please . I have several thousand question to ask you . klaatu ( ignore the invitation ) I would like to explain something of my mission here . barnhardt that be my first question . klaatu ( with some bitterness ) it be my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nation of the Earth -- but I be not allow the opportunity . I have come to realize since that you mutual fear and suspicion be merely the normal reaction of a primitive society . ( gather he thought ) we know from scientific observation that you have discover a rudimentary kind of atomic energy . we also know that you be experiment with rocket . barnhardt yes -- that be true . klaatu in the hand of a mature civilization , this would not be consider weapon of aggression . but in the hand of you people -- ( he shrug and shake he head ) we have observe you aggressive tendency , and we do not trust you with such power . barnhardt ( puzzle ) if you mean that you be afraid of we -- klaatu ( with cool impressive emphasis ) we want to be sure you do not make -- let we say -- a unfortunate mistake . we know the potentiality of this development and we be disturb to find they in the hand of child ... you see , we have have atomic energy for five thousand of you year . ( indicate the telephone ) we discard instrument like this many century ago . ( he pace thoughtfully ) so long as you be limited to fight among yourselves -- with you primitive tank and plane -- we be unconcern . but soon you will apply atomic energy to space ship -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planet . that , of course , we cannot tolerate . barnhardt ( thoughtful and impressed ) this other planet -- do they have peace and security ? klaatu we have we atomic war -- thousand of year ago . ( he smile wryly ) after that we fight with bow and arrow . then , slowly , we learn that fight be no solution -- that aggression lead to chaos . barnhardt ( with deep conviction ) we scientist understand this . even we primitive scientist . ( straightforwardly ) what exactly be the nature of you mission , Mr. klaatu ? klaatu I come here to warn you that , by threaten danger , you planet face danger -- very grave danger . I be prepare , however , to offer a solution . barnhardt would you care to be more specific ? klaatu ( evenly ) what I have to say must be say to all concerned . ( with a suggestion of deference to barnhardt ) it be too important to be entrust to any individual . barnhardt be force reluctantly to accept klaatu 's refusal to go any further . after a moment 's think , he speak seriously , but with a twinkle in he eye . barnhardt I gather that you effort on the official level be not entirely successful . klaatu ( sternly , as this unpleasant episode be recall ) I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience be wear thin . ( with jovian annoyance ) must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing ? barnhardt ( uneasily ) what -- what sort of action do you mean ? klaatu violent action -- since that seem to be the only thing you people understand . ( quietly ) level the island of Manhattan , perhaps -- or drop the rock of Gibraltar into the sea . barnhardt stand stare at he for a moment , pass he hand across he brow . then , as klaatu watch , barnhardt pace the floor , try to digest what he have hear . after a moment , he turn to klaatu . barnhardt would you be willing to meet with the group of scientist I be call together ?. perhaps you could explain you mission to they , and they in turn could present it to they various people . klaatu ( quietly , evenly ) that 's what I come to see you about . barnhardt fling he a glance , then look momentarily sheepish . but he own eagerness carry he on . he pace the floor thoughtfully . barnhardt it be not enough to have man of science . we scientist be too easily ignore -- or misunderstand . we must get important man from every field . educator -- philosopher -- church leader -- man of vision and imagination -- the finest mind in the world . klaatu I leave that in you hand . barnhardt you would have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting ? klaatu no -- not at all . barnhardt what about you personal safety in the meantime ? what about the Army -- and the police ? klaatu my name be carpenter and I be a very earthy character live in a respectable board house . barnhardt ( smile , but a little concerned ) I be afraid I can not offer you any real protection . I have no influence in case of inter- planetary conspiracy . klaatu I be sure I will be quite safe until the meeting . barnhardt ( he suddenly pause , thoughtfully ) one thing , Mr. klaatu . suppose this group should reject you proposal . what be the alternative ? klaatu ( with a sense of quiet , inescapable power ) I be afraid you have no alternative . in such , a case the planet Earth would have to be -- ( he look for the right word ) -- eliminate . the implication of this statement leave barnhardt speechless , he keen mind reeling . barnhardt such power exist ? klaatu I assure you such power exist . barnhardt stand silent for a moment , try to collect he shattered thought . klaatu watch he as he start pace again . barnhardt the people who come to the meeting must be make to realize this . they must understand what be at stake . ( after a thoughtful moment , he look up ) you mention a demonstration of force -- klaatu yes . barnhardt would such , a demonstration be possible before the meeting ? klaatu yes -- of course . barnhardt something that would dramatize for they and for they people the seriousness of the situation . something that would affect the entire planet . klaatu ( with a nod ) that can easily be arrange . barnhardt ( frighten by he easy assumption of infinite power ) I would not want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything . klaatu ( easily ) why do not you leave it to I ? I will think of something . barnhardt ( with a nervous half - smile ) maybe a little demonstration . klaatu ( think about it ) something dramatic -- but not destructive . ( intellectually amused ) it 's quite a interesting problem . ( barnhardt nod vaguely ) would day after tomorrow be all right ? say about noon ? klaatu 's bland manner leave barnhardt shake , almost wishing he would never start this business . fade out : int . live room - boardinghouse - night it be about 3:30 the follow evening . helen be sit in a chair leaf through a magazine . she be dress to go out . a corner of the dining room can be see , where Mr. and Mrs. barley be play card with Mr. krull . Mrs. crockett , the landlady , enter from the hall on she way to the dining room and notice helen . mrs . crockett go out , dear ? helen yes , I be wait for Tom to pick I up . mrs . crockett ( with a shudder ) personally , I will not go out after dark this day . ( with a attempt at slyness ) but then -- I be not court , be I ? she turn to go on into the dining room and as she do so almost bump into klaatu who be come out , have be kibitze the card game . mrs . crockett ( thoroughly startle ) oh -- Mr. carpenter --! klaatu step aside as she hurry nervously into the dining room . he turn , puzzle , to find helen watch with a slight smile . klaatu everyone seem so -- ( he shake he hand to indicate nervousness ) helen jittery be the word . helen watch he , a little uneasy in he presence . she be fond of he , and she can not help be curious and concerned about he brush with the police . klaatu ( with a contemplative smile ) Bobby 's the only person I know who be not -- jittery . helen he have he homework to keep he occupy . klaatu ( fondly , sincerely ) he 's a fine boy , Mrs. benson . helen naturally I think so . klaatu warm and friendly and intelligent -- ( thoughtfully ) you know -- he 's the only real friend I have make since I have be here . helen be deeply move by klaatu 's affection for the boy , she try to dismiss she curiosity about he , but she can not . she decide to face it . helen ( hesitantly and with some difficulty ) Mr. carpenter -- this be none of my business , but -- why do that detective come here last night ? klaatu ( with easy frankness ) oh -- they just want to ask I a few question . Bobby and I try to see Professor barnhardt in the afternoon , but he be not in . apparently they think I be look for secret of some kind . helen have react in puzzlement at this second mention of barnhardt . they be interrupt by the ringing of the doorbell . helen go to answer it . int . hallway as helen open the front door to admit Tom . he appear impatient , anxious to get go . helen hello -- tom you ready ? helen I will be in just a minute . tom ( a little annoyed that she have not she coat on , he consult he watch ) the picture start at eight - fifty . helen ( in explanation ) I be talk to Mr. carpenter . tom ( lightly , but with real sarcasm underneath ) I hope Mr. carpenter will not think I be intrude . helen try to shush he , to indicate klaatu be in the next room , when klaatu appear in the doorway . he must have hear Tom 's remark , and there be a awkward moment . klaatu be completely unperturb , but helen be embarrassed . klaatu Excuse I . I be just go up to my room . helen ( guiltily ) goodnight , Mr. carpenter . klaatu stop and turn to face they pleasantly . klaatu have a good time -- both of you . he go on up the stair . helen steer Tom toward the live room . helen why do not you wait in here while I get my thing ? int . live room as they enter from the hall , helen turn to Tom reproachfully . helen ( quietly ) oh , Tom , that be awful . tom ( momentary apologetic ) I be sorry . I guess I be just tired of hearing about Mr. carpenter . ( helen shush he ) I do not like the way he 's attach himself to you and Bobby . after all , what do you know about he ? this touch on helen 's own private doubt , and she cannot answer . helen I will go get my thing . she turn quickly and go into the hall and hurry up the stair . Tom look after she , dismiss the matter with a shake of the head and a philosophical sigh . of such stuff be woman make . int - upstair hallway helen reach the top of the stair , cross to she room and grab a coat off the bed . she 's put it on as she move down the hall to Bobby 's room , the door of which be open . int . bobby's room Bobby be at a table do he homework and klaatu have just finish explain a arithmetic problem to he , as helen enter , still put on she coat . klaatu ( about to leave ) all you have to remember be , first find the common denominator -- then subtract . bobby thanks , Mr. carpenter . klaatu ( to helen , pleasantly ) I will say goodnight again . helen be embarrassed . she would like to apologize for the awkwardness downstairs but she do not quite know how to go about it . helen Mr. carpenter , I -- ( it 's too complicated ; she can not do it ) goodnight . klaatu ( with a warm smile of complete understanding and appreciation ) goodnight , my dear . he turn and go out , close the door . a little distract , helen turn to Bobby . helen go to bed , darling . you can finish that in the morning . bobby okay . helen watch as he start to put away he work . she want to tell he something , but find it difficult to say . helen ( hesitantly , almost guiltily ) Bobby -- I think it would be better if we do not see quite so much of Mr. carpenter bobby ( shocked , and bewilder ) gee , why , Mom ? he 's my best friend ... and he 's awful good in arithmetic . he even help Professor barnhardt . helen do you and Mr. carpenter really go to see Professor barnhardt ? bobby sure we do ! he be not there but we go to see he . and Mr. carpenter show he how to do he arithmetic . helen be surprised to get this corroboration for klaatu 's story . sense he mother 's uneasiness , the boy look for something intrigue -- some deep , dark secret . bobby ( shrewdly ) Mom -- be there something wrong with Mr. carpenter ? helen what do you mean , dear ? bobby I mean -- on account of that policeman last night .
