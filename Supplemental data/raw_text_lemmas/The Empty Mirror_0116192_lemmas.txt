( " third eye of expand perception " ) red-liquid seepage at the corner of the cell turn to steady drip , then to red rivulet . Red liquid run down the bio - texture wall . crack appear in the ceiling ... plaster crumble from the ceiling and upper wall . distant scream . Adolf look up . on the screen : image of death . Dead soldier in the snow . two dead man lie on a sidewalk in a ghetto . Men with a wood cart pick they up , join other cart of dead people . Soldiers open fire on helpless civilian hold shovel , who fall into grave they have dig themselves . woman drag thin dead body through ash , dump they on pile of other dead . bulldozer push naked dead body into pit . on adolf : he see . maybe for the first time , he see . the empty mirror - final production script - June 5 , 1995 p.116 he move closer and closer . until , as we look at he from behind , he be surround by death . we push past he to the screen . the image slow down ; so they be even more unavoidable . slow dissolve : Adolf 's face ( during the long dissolve , he face be superimpose over the image of death ) . he back towards the wall , he hand out to keep himself from fall against it . when he 's press against the stone , no where else to go , he 's force again to face the screen . we see he hand grope the wall behind he , as if unconsciously look for a way to climb up it . we notice shape in the wall : bone , perhaps the eye-socket of a skull , barely protrude from the " stone " of the wall ( like dinosaur bone in a archaeological dig . ) finally , Adolf glance at the place where he hand seek a hold , see that it 's a skull . he 's surround by bone . his hand be cover in blood . Adolf 's eye expand , almost beyond normal size ( exaggerated optically ) , as they absorb the horror . he open he mouth unnaturally wide ( exaggerated optically ) to scream . we freeze he face , mid-scream , just as the scream begin on the sound track fade to black . another scream , and then another , and then another , each overlap the previous , each louder and more horrific , more animalistic than the last . as if he will scream forever . as the scream echo ... dissolve to : 161 a prison wall begins to collapse as the stone and mortar collapse , bone and corpse imbed into the wall be reveal . they collapse with the wall . then another , bone and rock and mortar , collapse . yet another . the scream continue . the empty mirror - final production script - June 5 , 1995 p.117 a red torrent crash in , as if from a damn break . the red flood sweep up everything in its path : the flag , the uniform mannequin , the painting , the sculpture , the file . the typewriter . the flood rush over we . all be lose . fade to black : 162 slowly pull out and back from the blackness until we see that the black be that of a pupil . we keep back out , to see the iris , then the whole eye . eventually , we have pull out to Adolf 's face , which be now gaunt , hollow . he be older . his hair be grayer , thin , longer . his skin be dry , talc-like . age . the only sound : his breathing . until ... the camera rise up to see that Adolf be slump in a near- fetal position , in the far corner of the cell , small and vulnerable . he be down to he trousers and a tear , stain shirt . slowly rock himself . he be without will . spineless . ( asa drunk wallowing in the street , or a man in a mental institution who 's lose all trace of human spirit ) . adolf' hand slowly reach out , slide across the floor of the cell . higher , wider angle the cell , totally empty except for Adolf . we see that the cell , dry now , be completely empty . barren . washed clean of every last scrap of Adolf 's trapping and " history . " the screen in the background be pitch black , a black rectangle against a slightly lighter wall . emptiness . the wall appear to be make of cloth , with the texture and color of the earlier rigid wall paint on they . torn and gape in place , they billow in a mysterious breeze . the empty mirror - final production script - June 5 , 1995 p.118 the light be flat ... stark ... dim . no drama or dynamism to it whatsoever . close on adolf there 's a long , pause . the sense of a presence on the other side of the wall , through the open , be slightly great ( strongest light and music motif ) . we hear Adolf 's voice , but he lip do not move . adolf ( v.o. ) all this madness ... the destruction ... the human suffer ... he can barely speak . chill , he shiver . adolf I too be trap in the whirlwind we create ... a empty mirror fill with hate . Adolf turn , look up toward the open in the wall , where the light emanate . the light be whiter , more intense . adolf ( v.o. ) I expect God to reach down ( gesture ) and stop I ... but he never do ... we dissolve to the open in the wall . we dissolve back to Adolf . he listen for a answer , make no move . we dissolve back to the open in the wall : silence . adolf please .... please say something ... please help I . only more silence . from off screen : the SOUND of the projector 163 on the screen : slow motion hitler speak from on high impassion . enrage . the quintessential Hitler , but in total silence . the empty mirror - final production script - June 5 , 1995 p.119 adolf , in the cell , stand close to the screen , he head tilt back to look up at the cell - screen from a extremely oblique angle . on the screen : his image tower above he . in the cell : Adolf step into the projector 's beam , he shadow fall on the cell - screen . in contrast with Hitler on the screen , Adolf 's rigid spine of will have curve and slouched with age . he turn toward the projector , he historical image project onto he face in the cell . he squint into the light , move slowly toward it . on the screen behind he : more quintessential Hitler from the day of he rise to power . on the SOUND track : distorted music , effect and speech derive from source such as wagner , parade cheer , rally chant , Hitler 's speech , and bonfire , etc ... we hear in the score strain of " die irae . " ( the music of death ) . adolf' Pov : a small circle of white against a black field . the circle get larger as he move toward the projector . on adolf : the projector 's flicker slow so that we see the black / white contrast clearly . ( we hear a slow motorize click on sound track ) . his expression be strangely calm . the light be so bright as he approach , Adolf 's figure begin to white out entirely . angle from behind adolf Ray of light knife between he arm and leg as he move , outline he , blast outward like laser beam . adolf be almost totally white . the tempo of flash light on he be at its slowest . the chatter of the machine be a high -pitch pounding ... 164 there be a sudden flash of brilliant white . the explosion of light and sound be follow by fuzzy smear of shadow and light . on adolf the empty mirror - final production script - June 5 , 1995 p.120 he continue on , directly towards a strange mechanism at the end of a dark tunnel . project onto he : vibrate , out -of -focus smear of shadow and light . adolf from behind adolf Beyond he , we see for the first time : the film gate . a large frame , about six foot high by ten foot wide . behind it be bright light , filter now by the color and pattern streaking through the " gate . " above the gate be half of the next " frame " . below , half of the last . the shadowy , nondescript machinery make loud , distorted noise , as dreamlike as the image . Adolf approach in slow motion . ( when he blink or move , it be surreal , haunt ) . 165 a few feet from the film plane Adolf stop . the image cease streaking and become visible at normal speed . mostly , they be image that represent the " illusion " create by the Adolf and the Nazi party , all of which we have study throughout the film : rally , parade , flag , uniform , etc ... the image change every three or four second . Adolf reach out one hand , and slow the image , so that we see the figure move at about half speed . he put out both hand . now we see they move at quarter speed . he slow the image even more , so that we almost see each individual frame slam into the gate , then hold there , then yank away and replace by the next . angle from behind adolf , looking at film plane he pull back , pause . the image speed up again . he reach in a finger and let he fingernail scrape the film . the film scratch , transmit a jag streak of white light . with increase confidence , and a consistently calm attitude , Adolf now lean back , close he hand together ( almost prayer - like ) , and firmly push they through the film , split , release more white light . the image part like water come down a waterfall . the empty mirror - final production script - June 5 , 1995 p.121 the shape of the tear suggest the shape of the open in the wall . the light beam through it , just as it do from the open in the wall , only a hundred time brighter . close on adolf' face - fear , apprehension ... but also eagerness , hope . Adolf spread he hand apart , use considerable effort to widen the rend in the elastic film , split the film in two . brilliant white light flare the lens , almost white out we entire frame . Adolf close he hand again , then open he palm against the flow , to force open the rend to about three time the width of the first open . he lean toward the open . the light gushes through , onto Adolf . there be a chorus of voice . for a moment , Adolf look directly into the light , but quickly grimace at its unbearable purity and brilliance . he squint he eye , turn away , unable to look into it , and raise he hand to block the intense ray . the instant he let go of the rip film strip to shield he eye , the film -strip curtain close , again filter out the light . the image on the film strip once again take shape . on adolf' back he take a moment to recover from the trauma of the light . when he have , he turn toward we . as he look at we ( into the lens ) we push slowly closer . the expression on he face be one of profound realization , and extreme sadness and anguish . ( slow -motion ) on the sound track : dissonant music , distant human scream . optical : the film frame zoom back slightly , create a thin , but slowly expand border around the last shot . ( like a chinese box within a chinese box ) we dissolve into a actual photo of the man ( or live action ) . then dissolve to red . the empty mirror - final production script - June 5 , 1995 p.122 dissolve to white . then to black . then to white . then to swirling grain the end . black credit roll over white " the filmmaker wish to acknowledge a variety of great work of literature from which a modest number of line of dialogue be borrow .
