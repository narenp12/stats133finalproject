PADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Welcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban
high school in Portland, Oregon. Smarties, Skids, Preppies,
Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep
out of their eyes and head for the main building.

PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY

KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be
-- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of
coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered,
baby blue '75 Dodge Dart.

A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and
spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack.

The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees
who his board has hit.

                         RIDER
          Hey -- sorry.

Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered
belongings.

                         KAT
          Leave it

He persists.

                       KAT (continuing)
          I said, leave it!

She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a
car, skateboard tip to his throat. He whimpers pitifully
and she lets him go. A path clears for her as she marches
through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door,
entering school.

INT. GIRLS' ROOM - DAY

BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the
mirror, applying lipstick. Her less extraordinary, but
still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her.

                       BIANCA
          Did you change your hair?

                         CHASTITY

          No.

                       BIANCA
          You might wanna think about it

Leave the girls' room and enter the hallway.

HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS

Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both
boys
and girls alike.

                       BOY
                 (adoring)
          Hey, Bianca.

                       GIRL
          Awesome shoes.

The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and
unaddressed by her side. Bianca smiles proudly,
acknowledging her fans.

GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY

CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open,
farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery
guidance counselor.

                       MISS PERKY
          I'm sure you won't find Padua any
          different than your old school. Same
          little asswipe mother-fuckers
          everywhere.

Her plastic smile never leaves her face.   Cameron fidgets in
his chair uncomfortably.

                       MISS PERKY
                 (continuing)
          Any questions?

                       CAMERON
          I don't think so, ma'am

                       MISS PERKY
          Then go forth. Scoot    I've got
          deviants to see.

Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK
VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms
Perky's door. His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he
is.

Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick

                       MISS PERKY
                 (continuing)

          Patrick Verona. I see we're making our
          visits a weekly ritual.

She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming
smile.

                        PATRICK
          I missed you.

                       MISS PERKY
          It says here you exposed yourself to a
          group of freshmen girls.

                       PATRICK
          It was a bratwurst. I was eating
          lunch.

                       MISS PERKY
          With the teeth of your zipper?

She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron
shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky,
brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game
show host.

                       MICHAEL
          You the new guy?

                       CAMERON
          So they tell me...

                        MICHAEL
          C'mon.   I'm supposed to give you the
          tour.

They head out of the office

                       MICHAEL
                 (continuing)
          So -- which Dakota you from?

                       CAMERON
          North, actually. How'd you     ?

                       MICHAEL
          I was kidding. People actually live
          there?

                       CAMERON
          Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by
          the cows, though.

                       MICHAEL
          How many people were in your old
          school?

                        CAMERON
          Thirty-two.

                       MICHAEL
          Get out!

                       CAMERON
          How many people go here?

                       MICHAEL
          Couple thousand. Most of them evil

INT. HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS

Prom posters adorn the wall. Michael steers Cameron through
the crowd as he points to various cliques.

                       MICHAEL
          We've got your basic beautiful people.
          Unless they talk to you first, don't
          bother.

The beautiful people pass, in full jock/cheerleader
splendor.

                       MICHAEL
                 (continuing)
          Those 're your cowboys.

Several Stetson-wearing, big belt buckle. Wrangler guys
walk by.

                       CAMERON
          That I'm used to.

                       MICHAEL
          Yeah, but these guys have never seen a
          horse. They just jack off to Clint
          Eastwood.

They pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled
around it.

                       MICHAEL
                 (continuing)
          To the right, we have the Coffee Kids.
          Very edgy. Don't make any sudden
          movements around them.

EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY

Michael continues the tour

                       MICHAEL
          And these delusionals are the White
          Rastae.

Several white boys in dreadlocks and Jamaican knit berets
lounge on the grass. A cloud of pot smoke hovers above them

                       MICHAEL
                 (continuing)

           Big Marley fans. Think they're black.
           Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a
           lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I
           mean.

Michael waves to DEREK, the one with the longest dreads.

                        MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
           Derek - save some for after lunch, bub?

                        DEREK
                  (very stoned)
           Michael, my brother, peace

Cameron turns to follow Michael as they walk into the
cafeteria.

                        CAMERON
           So where do you fit in all this?

INT.   CAFETERIA - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Loud music and loud students.      Michael sits with a group of
studious-looking teens.

                        MICHAEL
           Future MBAs- We're all Ivy League,
           already accepted. Someday I'll be
           sipping Merlot while those guys --

He points to the table of jocks, as they torture various
passers-by.

                        MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
           are fixing my Saab. Yuppie greed is
           back, my friend.

He points proudly to the ALLIGATOR on his shirt.

Cameron stops listening as BIANCA walks by, and we go SLO
MO. Pure and perfect, she passes Cameron and Michael
without a look.

Cameron is smitten

                        CAMERON
           That girl -- I --

                        MICHAEL
           You burn, you pine, you perish?

                         CAMERON
           Who is she?

                        MICHAEL
           Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't
           even think about it

                        CAMERON
          Why not?

                       MICHAEL
          I could start with your haircut, but it
          doesn't matter. She's not allowed to
          date until her older sister does. And
          that's an impossibility.

ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

A room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space
MS. BLAISE, the one-step-away-from-medication English
Teacher, tries to remember what she's talking about.

                       MRS. BLAISE
          Well, then. Oh, yes. I guess that
          does it for our analysis of The Old Man
          and the Sea. Any other comments?
                 (with dread)
          Kat?

Kat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes
off her glasses and speaks up.

                       KAT
          Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys?

                        MRS. BLAISE
          I'm sorry?

                       KAT
          This book is about a guy and his
          fishing habit. Not exactly a crucial
          topic.

The other students roll their eyes.

                       KAT
                 (continuing)
          Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still
          revere Hemingway. He was an abusive,
          alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of
          cats.

JOEY DORSEY, a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones,
makes fun of her from his row.

                       JOEY
          As opposed to a bitter self-righteous
          hag who has no friends?

A few giggles.   Kat ignores him.   A practiced gesture

                       MRS. BLAISE
          That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.

Really gets fired up now

                       KAT
          I guess the school board thinks because
          Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's
          worthy of our time

She looks up at Ms. Blaise, who is now fighting with her
pill box.

                       KAT
                 (continuing)
          What about Colette?      Charlotte Bronte?
          Simone de Beauvoir?

Patrick, lounging in his seat in the back row, elbows a
crusty-looking crony, identified by the name SCURVY,
embroidered on his workshirt.

                         PATRICK
          Mother Goose?

The class titters.   Kat wears an expression of intolerance

INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Kat now sits before Miss Perky.

                       MISS PERKY
          Katarina Stratford. My, my. You've
          been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.

                       KAT
          Expressing my opinion is not a
          terrorist action.

                       MISS PERKY
          Well, yes, compared to your other
          choices of expression this year, today's
          events are quite mild. By the way,
          Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation
          went quite well, in case you're
          interested.

                       KAT
          I still maintain that he kicked himself
          in the balls. I was merely a spectator.

                       MISS PERKY
          The point is Kat -- people perceive you
          as somewhat ...

Kat smiles at her, daring her to say it.

                         KAT
          Tempestuous?

                       MISS PERKY
          No ... I believe ""heinous bitch"" is the
          term used most often.

She grimaces, as if she's referring to a medical condition.

                       MISS PERKY
                 (continuing)
          You might want to work on that

Kat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the
counselor's.

                       KAT
          As always, thank you for your excellent
          guidance.

INT. SOPHOMORE ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

Bianca ignores the droning teacher as she writes a note in
big flowing handwriting.

                       TEACHER (0.S.)
          I realize the language of Mr.
          Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting,
          but I'm sure you're all doing your best.

Bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip
of her hair to CHASTITY. Chastity opens the note and reads:

INSERT - ""JOEY DORSEY SAID HI TO ME IN THE HALL! OH! MY
GOD!""

Chastity frowns to herself.

                       TEACHER (0.S.)
                 (continuing)
          Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment
          on what you've read so far?

Bianca looks up and smiles the smile of Daddy's little girl.

                        BIANCA
          Not really.

The teacher shakes her head, but lets it go.

MANDELLA. a waif-like senior girl who sits off to the side
trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her
notebook, looks up and raises her hand.

                       TEACHER
          Mandella -- since you're assisting us,
          you might as well comment. I'm assuming
          you read the assignment.

                       MANDELLA
          Uh, yeah, I read it all

                       TEACHER
          The whole play^

                       MANDELIA
          The whole folio. All the plays.

                       TEACHER
                 (disbelieving)
          You've read every play by William
          Shakespeare?

                         MANDELLA
          Haven't you?

She raises a challenging eyebrow. The stunned teacher
doesn't answer and goes to call on the next student.

EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY

Mandella and Kat sit down in the quiet corner. They are
eating a carton of yogurt with gusto.

                         MANDELLA

Your sister is so amazingly without.   She'll never read him.
She has no idea.

Kat attacks

                       KAT
          The fact that you're cutting gym so you
          can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear
          his name, is a little without in itself
          if you ask me.

Kat's attention is caught by Patrick as he walks by with his
friends, lighting up a cigarette. Mandella notices her
staring.

                         MANDELLA
          Who's that?

                       KAT
          Patrick Verona   Random skid.

                       MANDELLA
          That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone
          for a year? I heard he was doing porn
          movies.

                       KAT
          I'm sure he's completely incapable of
          doing anything that interesting.

                       MANDELLA
          He always look so

                         KAT
          Block E?

Kat turns back to face Mandella and forces her yogurt into
Mandella's hand.

                         KAT
                   (continuing)
            Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a
            very slow way to die.

                         MANDELLA
            Just a little.

She eats.    Kat sees her wrist

                           KAT
            What's this?

                         MANDELLA
            An attempted slit.

Kat stares at her, expressionless.

                         KAT
            I realize that the men of this fine
            institution are severely lacking, but
            killing yourself so you can be with
            William Shakespeare is beyond the scope
            of normal teenage obsessions. You're
            venturing far past daytime talk show
            fodder and entering the world of those
            who need very expensive therapy.

                         MANDELLA
            But imagine the things he'd say during
            sex.

Thinks a minute

                         KAT
            Okay, say you do it. You kill
            yourself, you end up in wherever you end
            up and he's there. Do you really think
            he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound
            compulsive who failed volleyball?

Mandella's attention is struck by Bianca

ACROSS THE COURTYARD

As she and Chastity parade by Joey and his COHORTS     One of
the cohorts elbows Joey.

                           COHORT
            Virgin alert.

Joey looks up and smiles at Bianca.

                         JOEY
            Lookin' good, ladies.

Bianca smiles her coyest of smiles.

BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA Still watching.

                       MANDELLA
          Tragic.

Doesn't respond

ANOTHER ANGLE

Michael and Cameron observe Joey's leers at Bianca from
their bench in another corner. Cowboys eating cue of a can
of beans linger on the grass behind them.

                       CAMERON
          Why do girls like that always like guys
          like that?

                       MICHAEL
          Because they're bred to. Their mothers
          liked guys like that, and their
          grandmothers before them. Their gene
          pool is rarely diluted.

                       CAMERON
          He always have that shit-eating grin?

                       MICHAEL
          Joey Dorsey? Perma-shit-grin. I wish
          I could say he's a moron, but he's
          number twelve in the class. And a
          model. Mostly regional stuff, but he's
          rumored to have a big tube sock ad
          coming out.

The BELL rings, and the cowboys stand and spit into their
empty bean cans.   Cameron and Michael rise as Cameron tries
to catch a glimpse of Bianca as she walks back inside.

                       MICHAEL
                 (continuing)
          You know French?

                       CAMERON
          Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada

                       MICHAEL
          Guess who just signed up for a tutor?

                       CAMERON
          You mean I'd get a chance to talk to
          her?

                       MICHAEL
          You could consecrate with her, my
          friend.

Cameron watches as Bianca flounces back into the building.

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

Kat and Mandella walk toward Kat's car.    Joey pulls up
beside her in his Viper.

                       JOEY
                 (re her dress)
          The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't
          you been reading your Sassy?

                       KAT
          Yeah, and I noticed the only part of
          you featured in your big Kmart spread
          was your elbow. Tough break.

                       JOEY
                 (practically
                 spitting)
          They're running the rest of me next
          month.

He zooms away as Kat yanks open the door of her Dart.
Mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they're in
a convertible.

                       KAT
          The people at this school are so
          incredibly foul.

                       MANDELLA
          You could always go with me.    I'm sure
          William has some friends.

They watch Joey's car as he slows next to Bianca and
Chastity as they walk toward the school bus.

ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY

                       JOEY
          Need a ride, ladies?

Bianca and Chastity can't get in Joey's car fast enough.   He
pulls away with a smile.

BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA

Mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch.

                       MANDELLA
          That's a charming new development

Kat doesn't answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the
tape deck. The sounds of JOYFUL PUNK ROCK fill the car.

As they pull out, Michael crosses in front of them on his
moped. Kat has to SLAM the brakes to keep from hitting him

                       KAT
                 (yelling)
          Remove head from sphincter!    Then

           pedal!

Michael begins fearfully, pedaling as Kat PEELS out, angry
at the delay.

Cameron rushes over

                        CAMERON
           You all right?

He slows to a stop

                        MICHAEL
           Yeah, just a minor encounter with the
           shrew.

                         CAMERON
           That's her?   Bianca's sister?

                        MICHAEL
           The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.

Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's
grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint
jobs away from its former glory as a REGULATION MAIL TRUCK -
- as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot.

INT.   STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY

SHARON STRATFORD, attractive and focused, sits in front of
her computer, typing quickly.   A shelf next to her holds
several bodice-ripper romance novels, bearing her name.

Kat stands behind her, reading over her shoulder as she
types.

                        KAT
           ""Undulating with desire, Adrienne
           removes her crimson cape, revealing her
           creamy --""

WALTER STRATFORD, a blustery, mad scientist-type
obstetrician, enters through the front door, wearing a
doctor's white jacket and carrying his black bag.

                         WALTER

I hope dinner's ready because I only have ten minutes before
Mrs. Johnson squirts out a screamer.

He grabs the mail and rifles through it, as he bends down to
kiss Sharon on the cheek.

                        SHARON
           In the microwave.

                        WALTER
                  (to Kat)
           Make anyone cry today?

                        KAT
          Sadly, no.   But it's only four-thirty.

Bianca walks in.

                       KAT
                 (continuing)
          Where've you been?

                       BIANCA
                 (eyeing Walter)
          Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.

She kisses him on the cheek

                       WALTER
          Hello, precious.

Walter kisses Bianca back as Kat heads up the stairs

                         KAT
          How touching.

Walter holds up a letter to Kat

                         WALTER
          What's this?    It says Sarah Lawrence?

Snatches it away from him.

                       KAT
          I guess I got in

Sharon looks up from her computer.

                       SHARON
          What's a synonym for throbbing?

                       WALTER
          Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of
          the country.

                         KAT
          I know.

                       WALTER
          I thought we decided you were going to
          school here. At U of 0.

                         KAT
          You decided.

                       BIANCA
          Is there even a question that we want
          her to stay?

Kat gives Bianca an evil look then smiles sweetly at

                       KAT
          Ask Bianca who drove her home

                       SHARON
          Swollen...turgid.

                       WALTER
                 (to Bianca; upset)
          Who drove you home?

Bianca glares at Kat then turns to Walter

                       BIANCA
          Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's
          this boy... and I think he might ask...

                       WALTER
          No! You're not dating until your sister
          starts dating. End of discussion.

                       BIANCA
          What if she never starts dating?

                       WALTER
          Then neither will you.   And I'll get to
          sleep at night.

                       BIANCA
          But it's not fair -- she's a mutant,
          Daddy!

                       KAT
          This from someone whose diary is
          devoted to favorite grooming tips?

                       WALTER
          Enough!

He pulls out a small tape recorder from his black bag.

                       WALTER
                 (continuing)
          Do you know what this is?

He hits the ""play' button and SHRIEKS OF PAIN emanate from
the tape recorder.

BIANCA AND WALTER
                 (in unison, by
                 rote)
          The sound of a fifteen-year-old in
          labor.

                       WALTER
          This is why you're not dating until
          your sister does.

                       BIANCA
          But she doesn't want to date.

                       WALTER
          Exactly my point

His BEEPER goes off and he grabs his bag again

                       WALTER
                 (continuing)
          Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich
          before you women start dilating?

                       SHARON
          Tumescent!

                       WALTER
                 (to Sharon; as he
                 leaves)
          You're not helping.

INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY

Cameron sits with an empty chair beside him.   Bianca arrives
in a flurry of blonde hair.

                       BIANCA
          Can we make this quick? Roxanne
          Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an
          incredibly horrendous public break- up
          on the quad. Again.

                       CAMERON
          Well, I thought we'd start with
          pronunciation, if that's okay with you.

BIANCA
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.   Please.

                       CAMERON
                 (looking down)
          Okay... then how 'bout we try out some
          French cuisine. Saturday? Night?

Bianca smiles slowly

                       BIANCA
          You're asking me out. That's so cute.
          What's your name again?

                       CAMERON
                 (embarrassed)
          Forget it.

Bianca seizes an opportunity.

                       BIANCA
          No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have
          a proper introduction ---

                       CAMERON

          Cameron.

                       BIANCA
          The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the
          mercy of a particularly hideous breed of
          loser. My sister. I can't date until
          she does.

                       CAMERON
          Seems like she could get a date easy
          enough...

She fingers a lock of her hair.   He looks on, dazzled.

                       BIANCA

The problem is, she's completely anti-social.

                       CAMERON
          Why?

                       BIANCA
          Unsolved mystery. She used to be
          really popular when she started high
          school, then it was just like she got
          sick of it or something.

                       CAMERON
          That's a shame.

She reaches out and touches his arm

                       BIANCA
          Gosh, if only we could find Kat a
          boyfriend...

                       CAMERON
          Let me see what I can do.

Cameron smiles, having no idea how stupid he is

INT. BIOLOGY CLASS

A frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks.
Michael and Cameron go for the spleen.

                       MICHAEL
          You're in school for one day and you
          ask out the most beautiful girl? Do you
          have no concept of the high school
          social code?

Cameron grins away

                        CAMERON
          I teach her French, get to know her,
          dazzle her with charm and she falls in
          love with me.

                       MICHAEL
          Unlikely, but even so, she still can't
          go out with you. So what's the
          point?

Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab
tables away. He's wearing biker glasses instead of goggles
as he tries to revive his frog.

                       CAMERON
          What about him?

                       MICHAEL
                 (confused)
          You wanna go out with him?

The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows

                       CAMERON
                 (impatient)
          No - he could wrangle with the sister.

Michael smiles.   Liking the intrigue.

                       MICHAEL
          What makes you think he'll do it?

                       CAMERON
          He seems like he thrives on danger

                       MICHAEL
          No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard
          he lit a state trooper on fire. He just
          got out of Alcatraz...

                       CAMERON
          They always let felons sit in on Honors
          Biology?

                       MICHAEL
          I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He
          sold his own liver on the black market
          so he could buy new speakers.

                       CAMERON
          Forget his reputation. Do you think
          we've got a plan or not?

                       MICHAEL
          Did she actually say she'd go out with
          you?

                       CAMERON
          That's what I just said

Michael processes this.

                       MICHAEL
          You know, if you do go out with Bianca,

          you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone.
          Strictly A-list. With me by your side.

                       CAMERON
          I thought you hated those people.

                       MICHAEL
          Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients
          when I get to Wall Street.

A cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the Coffee
Kid's latte. Cameron presses on, over the melee.

                       CAMERON
          So now all we gotta do is talk to him.

He points to Patrick, who now makes his frog hump another
frog, with full-on sound effects.

                       MICHAEL
          I'll let you handle that.

INT. WOODSHOP - DAY

Boys and a few stray girls nail their pieces of wood

Michael sits next to PEPE, a Coffee Kid, who holds out his
jacket like the men who sell watches in the subway. Inside
several bags of coffee hang from hooks.

                       PEPE
          Some people like the Colombian, but it
          all depends on your acidity preference.
          Me? I prefer East African and
          Indonesian. You start the day with a
          Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian
          Sidamo in your cup, you're that much
          farther ahead than someone drinkin'
          Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I
          mean?

Michael nods solemnly.

ACROSS THE ROOM

Patrick sits at a table with Scurvy, making something that
looks like a machete out of a two-by-four.

Cameron approaches, full of good-natured farm boy cheer

                         CAMERON
          Hey, there

In response, Patrick brandishes a loud POWER TOOL in his
direction.

Cameron slinks away.

                         CAMERON

                 (continuing)
          Later, then.

Michael watches, shaking his head.

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

Joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria
tray with a magic marker.

Michael walks up and sits between them, casual as can be

                       MICHAEL
          Hey.

                       JOEY
          Are you lost?

                       MICHAEL
          Nope - just came by to chat

                       JOEY
          We don't chat.

                       MICHAEL
          Well, actually, I thought I'd run an
          idea by you. You know, just to see if
          you're interested.

                       JOEY
          We're not.

He grabs Michael by the side of the head, and proceeds to
draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker.   Michael
suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted.

                       MICHAEL
                 (grimacing)
          Hear me out. You want Bianca don't
          you?

Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing.

                       MICHAEL
                 (continuing)
          But she can't go out with you because
          her sister is this insane head case and
          no one will go out with her. right?

                       JOEY
          Does this conversation have a purpose?

                       MICHAEL
          So what you need to do is recruit a guy
          who'll go out with her. Someone who's
          up for the job.

Michael points to Patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his
turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage

can, rather than in it.

                        JOEY

That guy? I heard he ate a live duck once.     Everything but
the beak and the feet.

                        MICHAEL
          Exactly

Joey turns to look at Michael.

                        JOEY

What's in it for you?

                       MICHAEL
          Oh, hey, nothin' man    Purely good will
          on my part.

He rises to leave and turns to the others.

                       MICHAEL
                 (continuing)
          I have a dick on my face, don't I?

INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY

Michael stands at the sink, trying to scrub Joey's artwork
off his face as Cameron watches.

                       CAMERON
          You got him involved?

                       MICHAEL
          Like we had a choice? Besides -- when
          you let the enemy think he's
          orchestrating the battle, you're in a
          position of power. We let him pretend
          he's calling the shots, and while he's
          busy setting up the plan, you have time
          to woo Bianca.

Cameron grins and puts an arm around him

                       CAMERON
          You're one brilliant guy

Michael pulls back, noticing other guys filing in.

                        MICHAEL

Hey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but
it's not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who
Embraces Guys In The Bathroom.

Cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a
manly way for the others, now watching.

INT. KENNY'S THAI FOOD DINER - DAY

Kat and Mandella pick apart their pad thai.     Mandella is
smoking.

                        KAT
           So he has this huge raging fit about
           Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to
           his male-dominated, puking frat boy,
           number one golf team school. I have no
           say at all.

                         MANDELLA
           William would never have gone to a
           state school.

                        KAT
           William didn't even go to high school

                        MANDELLA
           That's never been proven

                        KAT
           Neither has his heterosexuality.

Mandella replies with a look of ice.   Kat uses the moment to
stub out Mandella's cigarette.

                        KAT
                  (continuing)
           I appreciate your efforts toward a
           speedy death, but I'm consuming.
                  (pointing at her
                  food)
           Do you mind?

                        MANDELLA
           Does it matter?

                        KAT
           If I was Bianca, it would be, ""Any
           school you want, precious. Don't forget
           your tiara.""

They both look up as Patrick enters.   He walks up to the
counter to place his order.

Mandella leans toward Kat with the glow of fresh gossip

                        MANDELLA
           Janice Parker told me he was a roadie
           for Marilyn Manson.

Patrick nods at them as he takes his food outside.

                        KAT
           Janice Parker is an idiot

INT.   MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY

Patrick sits before Miss Perky, eating his Thai food

                       MISS PERKY
                 (looking at chart)
          I don't understand, Patrick. You
          haven't done anything asinine this week.
          Are you not feeling well?

                       PATRICK
          Touch of the flu.

                       MISS PERKY
          I'm at a loss, then. What should we
          talk about? Your year of absence?

He smiles his charming smile

                       PATRICK
          How 'bout your sex life?

She tolerates his comment with her withering glance.

                       MISS PERKY
          Why don't we discuss your driving need
          to be a hemorrhoid?

                       PATRICK
          What's to discuss?

                       MISS PERKY
          You weren't abused, you aren't stupid,
          and as far as I can tell, you're only
          slightly psychotic -- so why is it that
          you're such a fuck-up?

                       PATRICK
          Well, you know -- there's the prestige
          of the job title... and the benefits
          package is pretty good...

The bell RINGS.

                       MISS PERKY
          Fine. Go do something repugnant and
          give us something to talk about next
          week.

INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY

Several pairs of tutors and students sit at the various
desks.

Mandella sits with TREVOR, a White Rasta. She attempts to
get him to do geometry, but he stares at her, as if smitten

                       MANDELLA
          Look, it's really easy.

                       TREVOR
          You're a freedom fighter. Be proud,
          sister.

Mandella sets down her pencil and closes the book.

                       MANDELLA
                 (rotely)
          It's Mandella with two L's. I am not
          related to Nelson Mandela. I am not a
          political figure. I do not live in
          South Africa. My parents just spent a
          few too many acid trips thinking they
          were revolutionaries.

                       TREVOR
          But you freed our people

                       MANDELLA
          Your ""people"" are white, suburban high
          school boys who smoke too much hemp. I
          have not freed you, Trevor.
                 (grabbing his arm
                 dramatically)
          Only you can free yourself.

ACROSS THE ROOM Bianca and Cameron sit side by side, cozy as
can be

                       BIANCA
          C'esc ma tete. This is my head

                          CAMERON
          Right.   See?    You're ready for the
          quiz.

                       BIANCA
          I don't want to know how to say that
          though. I want to know useful things.
          Like where the good stores are. How
          much does champagne cost? Stuff like
          Chat. I have never in my life had to
          point out my head to someone.

                       CAMERON
          That's because it's such a nice one.

                       BIANCA
          Forget French.

She shuts her book and puts on a seductive smile

                       BIANCA
                 (continuing)
          How is our little Find the Wench A Date
          plan progressing?

                       CAMERON
          Well, there's someone I think might be

          --

Bianca's eyes light up

                         BIANCA
          Show me

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Cameron and Bianca lean against the wall -inconspicuously.
Bianca plays it cool.

                       BIANCA
          Give me a sign when he walks by.    And
          don't point.

The bell RINGS. Kids flood past. Then Patrick saunters by
with Scurvy. Cameron nudges Bianca.

                         CAMERON
          There.

                         BIANCA
          Where?

Out of desperation, Cameron awkwardly lunges across
Patrick's path. Patrick shoves him back against the wall
without a thought. Cameron lands in a THUD at Bianca's
feet.

                       CAMERON
          I guess he didn't see me
                 (calling after
                 Patrick)
                           Some other time --

Bianca watches Patrick, a wicked gleam in    her eye.

                       BIANCA
          My God, he's repulsive. He's so
          perfect!

INT. GYM CLASS - DAY

Several volleyball games are being played.

Joey and a member of his hulking entourage, approach
Patrick, who still manages to look cool, even in gym
clothes. They pull him aside roughly.

                         PATRICK
                   (shrugging them
                   off)
          What?

Joey points

JOEY See that girl?

Patrick follows his line of vision to Kat as she spikes the
ball into some poor cowboy's face.

                       PATRICK
          Yeah

                       JOEY
          What do you think?

Kat wins the game and high fives the others, who are scared
of her.

                       PATRICK
          Two legs, nice rack...

                       JOEY
          Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out
          with her.

                       PATRICK
          Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.

                       JOEY
          You just said

                       PATRICK
          You need money to take a girl out

                       JOEY
          But you'd go out with her if you had
          the cake?

Patrick stares at Joey deadpan.    His dislike for the guy
obvious.

                       PATRICK
                 (sarcastic)
          Yeah, I'd take her to Europe if I had
          the plane.

Joey smiles.

                       JOEY
          You got it, Verona.    I pick up the tab,
          you do the honors.

                       PATRICK
          You're gonna pay me to take out some
          girl?

                       JOEY
          I can't date her sister until that one
          gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch.
          She doesn't want a boyfriend.

                       PATRICK
          How much?

                       JOEY

Twenty bucks each time you take her out.

                        PATRICK
          I can't take a girl like that out on
          twenty bucks.

                         JOEY
          Fine, thirty.

Patrick raises an eyebrow, urging him up

                       JOEY
                 (continuing)
          Take it or leave it.     This isn't a
          negotiation.

                       PATRICK
          Fifty, and you've got your man.

Patrick walks away with a smile

EXT. FIELD HOCKEY FIELD - DAY

Kat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice
session. Kat spares no one as she whips the ball all over
the field.

Patrick sits on the bleachers nearby, watching. A cigarette
dangles from his mouth. His pal, SCURVY is next to him.

MR. CHAPIN, the coach, blows the WHISTLE.

                       MR. CHAPIN
                 (proudly)
          Good run, Stratford.

Kat nods in response, and the girls leave the field. Patrick
hops down to follow.

                         PATRICK
          Hey. Girlie.

Kat stops and turns slowly to look at him.

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          I mean Wo-man. How ya doin'?

                       KAT
                 (smiles brightly)
          Sweating like a pig, actually.     And
          yourself?

                       PATRICK
          There's a way to get a guy's attention.

                       KAT
          My mission in life.

She stands there undaunted, hand on hip.

                       KAT
                 (continuing)
          Obviously, I've struck your fancy. So,
          you see, it worked. The world makes
          sense again.

Patrick's eyes narrow.    He steps closer.

                       PATRICK
          Pick you up Friday, then

                         KAT
          Oh, right.    Friday.

PATRICK backs up a little.    He uses his most seductive tone

                       PATRICK
          The night I take you to places you've
          never been before. And back.

                       KAT
          Like where? The 7-Eleven on Burnside?
          Do you even know my name, screwboy?

                       PATRICK
          I know a lot more than that

Kat stares at him.

                         KAT
          Doubtful.    Very doubtful.

She walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone.

                       PATRICK
                 (calling after her)
          You're no bargain either, sweetheart.

Scurvy appears at his side

                       SCURVY
          So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a
          new Blaupunkt.

ACROSS THE FIELD Cameron and Michael watch.

                       MICHAEL
          He took the bait.

STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT

Kat washes her face at the sink. Bianca appears behind her,
and attempts to twist Kat's hair into a chignon.

She wacks Bianca away.

                       BIANCA
          Have you ever considered a new look? I
          mean, seriously, you could have some
          potential buried under all this
          hostility.

Kat pushes past her into the hallway.

                       KAT
          I have the potential to smack the crap
          out of you if you don't get out of my
          way.

                       BIANCA
          Can you at least start wearing a bra?

Kat SLAMS her door in response.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Patrick, Scurvy and some other randoms head for the exit

SCURVY You up for a burger?

Patrick looks in his wallet.   It's empty.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Kat stands at her locker, gathering her books.    Patrick
appears at her side, smiling.

                       PATRICK
          Hey

Kat doesn't answer

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          You hate me don't you?

                       KAT
          I don't really think you warrant that
          strong an emotion.

                       PATRICK
          Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at
          the track with me.

                       KAT
          And why would I do that?

                       PATRICK
          Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer,
          you with money in your eyes, me with my
          hand on your ass...

                       KAT
          You -- covered in my vomit.

                       PATRICK
          Seven-thirty?

She slams her locker shut and walks away

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT

Kat emerges from a music store carrying a bag of CDs in her
teeth, and fumbling through her purse with both hands. She
finds her keys and pulls them out with a triumphant tug.

She looks up and finds Patrick sitting on the hood of her
car

                       PATRICK
          Nice ride. Vintage fenders.

Kat takes the bag out of her mouth.

                       KAT
          Are you following me?

                       PATRICK
          I was in the laundromat. I saw your
          car. Thought I'd say hi.

                       KAT
          Hi

She gets in and starts the car.

                       PATRICK
          You're not a big talker, are you?

                       KAT
          Depends on the topic. My fenders don't
          really whip me into a verbal frenzy.

She starts to pull out, and is blocked by Joey's Viper,
which pulls up perpendicular to her rear and parks.

Joey and his groupies emerge and head for the liquor store

                       KAT
                 (continuing)
          Hey -- do you mind?

                       JOEY
          Not at all

They continue on into the store.   Kat stares at them in
disbelief...

Then BACKS UP

Her vintage fenders CRASH into the door of Joey's precious
Viper.

Patrick watches with a delighted grin Joey races out of the

liquor store.

                       JOEY
                 (continuing)
          You fucking bitch!

Kat pulls forward and backs into his car again.   Smiling
sweetly.

INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT

Walter paces as Kat sits calmly on the couch.

                       WALTER
          My insurance does not cover PMS

                       KAT
          Then tell them I had a seizure.

                        WALTER
          Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You
          punishing me?

                       KAT
          I thought you were punishing me.

                       WALTER
          Why can't we agree on this?

                       KAT
          Because you're making decisions for me.

                       WALTER
          As a parent, that's my right

                       KAT
          So what I want doesn't matter?

                       WALTER
          You're eighteen. You don't know what
          you want. You won't know until you're
          forty-five and you don't have it.

                       KAT
                 (emphatic)
          I want to go to an East Coast school! I
          want you to trust me to make my own
          choices. I want --

Walter's BEEPER goes off

                       WALTER
          Christ! I want a night to go by that
          I'm not staring a contraction in the
          face.

He walks out, leaving Kat stewing on the couch.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Patrick shuts his graffiti-encrusted locker, revealing
Joey's angry visage, glowering next to him.

                       JOEY
          When I shell out fifty, I expect
          results.

                        PATRICK
          I'm on it

                       JOEY
          Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't
          count as a date.

                       PATRICK
          I got her under control. She just acts
          crazed in public to keep up the image.

Joey sees through the bluff

                       JOEY
          Let me put it to you this way, if you
          don't get any action, I don't get any
          action. So get your ass on hers by the
          end of the week.

Joey starts to walk off

                       PATRICK
          I just upped my price

                        JOEY
                  (turning)
          What?

                       PATRICK
          A hundred bucks a date.

                        JOEY
          Forget it.

                       PATRICK
          Forget her sister, then.

Joey thinks for a frustrated moment, PUNCHES the locker,
then peels another fifty out of his wallet with a menacing
scowl.

                       JOEY
          You better hope you're as smooth as you
          think you are, Verona.

Patrick takes the money with a smile.

INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
Cameron runs a sentence past Bianca.

                        CAMERON

           La copine et I 'ami?    La diferance?

Bianca glares at him.

                        BIANCA
           A ""copine"" is someone you can count on.
           An ""ami"" is someone who makes promises
           he can't keep.

Cameron closes the French book

                        CAMERON
           You got something on your mind?

                        BIANCA
           I counted on you to help my cause. You
           and that thug are obviously failing.
           Aren't we ever going on our date?

He melts

                        CAMERON
           You have my word. As a gentleman

                          BIANCA
           You're sweet.

She touches his hand. He blushes at her praise and watches
her toss her hair back

                        CAMERON
                  (appreciative)
           How do you get your hair to look like
           that?

                        BIANCA
           Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days.
           And I never, ever use a blowdryer
           without the diffuser attachment.

Cameron nods with interest.

                        CAMERON
           You know, I read an article about that.

Bianca looks surprised.

                          BIANCA
           You did?

INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY

Patrick stands at the sink, washing his hands Michael and
Cameron cower in the corner, watching him.

                          PATRICK
                    (without turning
                    around)
           Say it

                        MICHAEL
                  (clearing his
                  throat)
          What?

                       PATRICK
          Whatever the hell it is you're standin'
          there waitin' to say.

Cameron bravely steps forward

                       CAMERON
          We wanted to talk to you about the
          plan.

Patrick turns toward them.

                        PATRICK
          What plan?

                       MICHAEL
          The situation is, my man Cameron here
          has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.

                       PATRICK
          What is it with this chick?   She have
          three tits?

Cameron starts to object, but Michael holds up a hand.

                       MICHAEL
          I think I speak correctly when I say
          that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than
          say -- Joey Dorsey's.

                       PATRICK
          Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm
          just in this for the cash.

Cameron starts choking at the thought of Joey plowing his
beloved Bianca.

                       MICHAEL
          That's where we can help you.   With
          Kat.

                       PATRICK
          So Dorsey can get the girl?

                       MICHAEL
          Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the
          big picture. Joey's just a pawn. We set
          this whole thing up so Cameron can get
          the girl.

Patrick smiles.   He likes the idea of Joey being a pawn in
this game.

                        PATRICK
           You two are gonna help me tame the wild
           beast?

                        MICHAEL
                  (grinning)
           We're your guys.

                        CAMERON
           And he means that strictly in a non-
           prison-movie type of way.

                        PATRICK
           Yeah -- we'll see.

He swings the door open and exits, leaving Michael and
Cameron grinning at each other.

                          MICHAEL
           We're in.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

CU on a party invitation as it gets handed out. ""Future
Princeton Grad Bogey Lowenstein proudly presents a Saturday
night bash at his abode. Casual attire"".

Michael holds the invitation up to Cameron.

                        CAMERON
           This is it. A golden opportunity.
           Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.

                        MICHAEL
           In that case, we'll need to make it a
           school-wide blow out.

                        CAMERON
           Will Bogey get bent?

                        MICHAEL
           Are you kidding? He'll piss himself
           with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.

CAFETERIA - DAY

Michael hands a jock the party invite as they pass each
other at the trash cans.

INT.   GYM CLASS - DAY

The jock calls a fellow jock

INT.   MATH CLASS - DAY

Jock whispers to a cheerleader

COURTYARD - DAY

The cheerleader calls a White Rasta that she's making out
with, showing him the invite.

TRACK - DAY

The White Rasta tells a cowboy as they run laps during track
practice.

INT. SHOWERS - DAY

The cowboy Cells a Coffee Kid, as he shields his java from
the spray of the shower.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Joey stands ac his open locker with Bianca. The locker is
an homage to Joey's ""modeling"" career. Cheesy PRINT ADS of
him -- running in a field of daisies, petting a kitten, etc.
-- adorn the locker door.

                       JOEY
          Which do you like better?

INSERT - HEADSHOTS of Joey. In one, he's pouting in a white
shirt. In the other, he's pouting in a black shirt.

                       BIANCA
          I think I like the white shirt

Joey nods thoughtfully.

                       JOEY
          It's more

                       BIANCA
          Expensive?


                       JOEY
          Exactly
                 (beat)
          So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's
          thing on Saturday?

                       BIANCA
          Hopefully.

He gives her his best flirtatious smile

                       JOEY
          Good, 'cause I'm not gonna bother if
          you won't be there.

He taps her on the nose and she giggles

INT. TUTORING ROOM
Bianca sits across from Cameron, who's transfixed, as always

                       BIANCA

          Have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein's
          party?

                        CAMERON
          Sure have.

                       BIANCA
                 (pouting)
          I really, really, really wanna go, but
          I can't. Not unless my sister goes.

                       CAMERON
          I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem
          to be goin' for him.

He fishes.

                       CAMERON
                 (continuing)
          She's not a...

                       BIANCA
          Lesbian? No. I found a picture of
          Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm
          pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex
          tendencies.

                       CAMERON
          So that's the kind of guy she likes?
          Pretty ones?

                       BIANCA
          Who knows? All I've ever heard her say
          is that she'd dip before dating a guy
          that smokes.

Cameron furiously takes notes

                        CAMERON
          All right.   What else is she partial
          to?

INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT
Patrick plays pool with some random deviant cronies.

He looks up when he hears a COMMOTION at the door. LOU the
bouncer is in the midst of throwing Michael and Cameron out.

                       PATRICK
          Lou, it's okay. They're with me.

Lou looks at Patrick, surprised, then reluctantly lets our
two non-deviants pass through.

Patrick guides them to a table and sips from a beer.

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          What've you got for me?

                       CAMERON
          I've retrieved certain pieces of
          information on Miss Katarina Stratford I
          think you'll find helpful.

Cameron pulls out a piece of paper.

                         MICHAEL
                   (to Patrick)

One question before we start -- should you be drinking
alcohol when you don't have a liver?

                         PATRICK
          What?!

                         MICHAEL
          Good enough.

Cameron looks up at Patrick.

                         CAMERON
          Number one.    She hates smokers

                       MICHAEL
          It's a lung cancer issue

                       CAMERON
          Her favorite uncle

                       MICHAEL
          Dead at forty-one.

Patrick sits up

                        PATRICK
          Are you telling me I'm a -
                 (spits the word
                 out)
          ""non-smoker""?

                         MICHAEL
          Just for now.

                       CAMERON
          Another thing. Bianca said that Kat
          likes -- pretty guys.

This is met with silence.    Then:

                         PATRICK
          What?    You don't think I'm pretty?

Michael smacks Cameron

                         MICHAEL
          He's pretty!

                        CAMERON
          Okay!   I wasn't sure

Cameron goes back to the list.

                       CAMERON
                 (continuing)
          Okay -- Likes: Thai food, feminist
          prose, and ""angry, stinky girl music of
          the indie-rock persuasion"".

                       PATRICK
          So what does that give me? I'm
          supposed to buy her some noodles and a
          book and sit around listening to chicks
          who can't play their instruments?

                       MICHAEL
          Ever been to Club Skunk?

                        PATRICK
          Yeah.

                       CAMERON
          Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow
          night.

                       PATRICK
          Don't make me do it, man

                       MICHAEL
          Assail your ears for one night.

                       CAMERON
          It's her favorite band.

Patrick groans

                       MICHAEL
          I also retrieved a list of her most
          recent CD purchases, courtesy of
          American Express.

He hands it over.

                       PATRICK
                 (smiling)
          Michael -- did you get this information
          ""illegally""?

Michael puts a finger to his lips.

                       MICHAEL
          I prefer to think of it simply as an
          alternative to what the law allows.

                       PATRICK
          I'm likin' you guys better

He looks down at the list of CDs.

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          This is really music?

INT. KAT'S ROOM - NIGHT

MUSIC BLARES in a room with minimalist decor splashed with
indie rock band posters and flyers.

Kat and Mandella dance as they dress and apply make-up
Bianca enters, interrupting their fun.

                       BIANCA
          Can you turn down the Screaming
          Menstrual Bitches? I'm trying to study.

Kat doesn't move, so Bianca crosses to the stereo, turning
down the volume.

                       BIANCA
                 (continuing)
          Don't tell me you're actually going
          out? On a school night, no less.

Kat shoots her a glare

                       BIANCA
                 (continuing;
                 excited)
          Oh my God, does this mean you're
          becoming normal?

                       KAT
          It means that Gigglepuss is playing at
          Club Skunk and we're going.

                        BIANCA
                 (disappointed)
          Oh, I thought you might have a date
                 (beat)
          I don't know why I'm bothering to ask,
          but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's
          party Saturday night?

                       KAT
          What do you think?

                       BIANCA
          I think you're a freak. I think you do
          this to torture me. And I think you
          suck.

She smiles sweetly and shuts the door behind her.  Kat
doesn't bat an eye. She grabs her purse and opens the door

                         KAT
          Let's hit it.

EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT

A happy black and white neon skunk sprays fine mist on the
line of kids below.

INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT

Kat and Mandella walk in, Mandella nervously pulling out her
fake ID. The giant, afroed bouncer, BRUCE, looks typically
mono-syllabic.

                       MANDELLA
                 (whispering to Kat)
          You think this'll work?

                         KAT
          No fear.

They approach Bruce.   Kat puts on her happy, shiny face

                       KAT
                 (continuing)
          Hello! We'd like two for Gigglepuss!

Bruce looks the girls up and down.

                         BRUCE
          I can count.

He looks at their IDs. Mandella gently moves Kat aside,
wearing a face that could only be described as ""I AM a
Victoria's Secret model.""

                       MANDELLA
          I'll bet you can..

She sticks out her chest and licks her lips.   Bruce stares
at her deadpan and hands her back the IDs.

                        BRUCE
          Go ahead.
                  (to Mandella)
          And you

                       MANDELLA
                 (all come hither)
          Yes?

                       BRUCE
          Take it easy on the guys in there.

Mandella winks at him and sashays inside    Kat: follows
behind, shaking her head.

EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT

Patrick's mail truck clatters to a stop out front.

INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT

Patrick walks up to Bruce, who's frisking a badly mowhawked
PIERCED EYEBROW BOY. Bruce pulls a SWITCHBLADE out of the
boy's inside pocket.

                       BRUCE
          Next time, leave the Bic at home,
          Skippy.

                       SKIPPY
          It's a bottle opener.

Bruce pushes him inside the club, then sees Patrick.

                       BRUCE
          Verona, my man.

They shake.

                       PATRICK
          Always a pleasure, Brucie.

                       BRUCE
          Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss
          fan. Aren't they a little too pre-teen
          belly-button ring for you?

                       PATRICK
          Fan of a fan. You see a couple of
          minors come in?

                       BRUCE
          Never

                       PATRICK
          Padua girls. One tall, decent body.
          The other one kinda short and
          undersexed?

                       BRUCE
          Just sent 'em through.

Patrick starts to go in

                       BRUCE
                 (continuing)
          Hey -- what happened to that chick you
          brought last time? The one with the
          snake?

Patrick laughs and goes into the club

INT. CLUB - NIGHT

Onstage, the all-female band GIGGLEPUSS is parlaying their
bad girl sass into a ripping punk number.

Near the stage is a joyful mass of pogo-ing teens AT THE BAR

Patrick bellies up and looks around the club. Gigglepuss
finishes a song.

                       LEAD SINGER
          Hello, out there. We're Gigglepuss and
          we're from Olympia.

A teenage boy in the audience takes the opportunity to
scream.

                         BOY (0.S.)
          Pet my kitty!

                         LEAD SINGER
          Meow

They rev into their next song.

NEAR THE STAGE

Mandella and Kat glow with sweat. When they hear the
opening chords of the song, they look at each other and
scream with glee as they begin to dance. They couldn't be
having a better time.

AT THE BAR

Patrick signals to get the bartender's attention and looks
across the bouncing surge of the crowd. He spots Kat and
Mandella singing along.

HIS POV

The gleeful Kat -- dancing and looking completely at ease.
None of her usual ""attitude"". Patrick is transfixed. And
most definitely attracted.

NEAR THE STAGE Kat looks at Mandella.

                       KAT
                 (shouting)
          I need agua!

She makes her way through the crowd to the bar. AT THE BAR

She made it. She signals for the bartender and as she's
waiting, looks around. She spots Patrick a few feet away

                       KAT
                 (continuing to
                 herself)
          Shit

She sneaks a glance.    He's staring, but this time he looks
away before she can.    Despite herself, she's miffed.

The bartender arrives

                   (shouting)
            What can I get you?

                          KAT
            Two waters.

She looks at Patrick again. He's completely absorbed in the
band. She scowls. The bottled water arrives and she
marches off, forgetting to pay.

She walks up to Patrick.

                         KAT
                   (continuing)
            You're not fooling anyone.

Patrick looks at her, surprised

                          PATRICK
                    (yelling)
            hey.   Great show, huh?

                          KAT
                    (yelling)

If you're planning on asking me out you might as well get it
over with.

                         PATRICK
                   (yelling)
            Excuse me?

                         KAT
                   (yelling)
            That's what you want, isn't it?

                          PATRICK
                    (yelling; gesturing
                    toward the band)
            Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it
            for me.

Kat steams.    And watches him watch the band

                         KAT
                   (yelling)
            You're not surrounded by your usual
            cloud of smoke.

The band takes a break, so they can stop yelling now

                          PATRICK
            I know.   I quit.

He leans back, making no attempt to hit on her.   She moves
closer.

                          KAT

            Oh, really?

He motions toward the stage

                         PATRICK
            You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill
            or The Raincoats, but they're right up
            there.

                         KAT
            You know who The Raincoats are?

                         PATRICK
            Why, don't you?

She's completely taken aback. He uses the moment to his
advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into
her ear.

                         PATRICK
                   (continuing)
            I watched you out there    I've never
            seen you look like that

Kat steps away, brushing the hair back that he just touched
Her cheeks pinken.

His cocky side is back in a flash

                         PATRICK
                   (continuing)
            Come to that party with me.

At that moment, the band starts another SONG

                          KAT
                    (yelling)
            What?

The bartender approaches.

BARTENDER
                   (to Kat, yelling)
            You forgot to pay!

                         PATRICK
                   (yelling)
            I got it, Rick.

He tosses some bills on the bar

Rather than thank him, Kat simply watches him, trying to
figure out his motive.

                         PATRICK
                   (continuing;
                   yelling)
            Nine-thirty then.

A few people have gotten between them at the bar and she
can't hear a word he's saying. She gives him one last look
and heads back into the crowd.

Patrick smiles.   She didn't say no this time.

EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT

The crowd files out of the club, Kat and Mandella amongst
them. A^ they're walking toward the parking lot, Patrick
coasts by in his truck. The gears GRIND. He yells out the
window.

                       MANDELLA
          What'd he say?

                        KAT
          Who cares?

Mandella watches Kat as she stares after Patrick

                       MANDELLA
          Has he importun'd you with love in
          honourable fashion?

Kat glances sharply at her.

                       MANDELLA
                 (continuing; off
                 her look)
          Don't be Cruella with me. I'm in favor
          of romance. You're the one that wants
          to march on Washington every five
          minutes.

Kat pokes her, then looks back at the club dreamily.

                       KAT
          Gigglepuss was so beyond.

Mandella nods.

                       MANDELLA
          They were. I only wish William could
          have been here to witness the rebirth of
          punk rock with us.

Kat links her arm through Mandella's and they head for the
car.

                        KAT
          So true.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Cameron and Michael are at Michael's locker.

                       CAMERON
          So, then she says that she almost
          didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that

          dress because she thought she was
          mixing, you know, genres. And the fact
          that I noticed -- and I'm quoting here -
          ""really meant something.""

Cameron looks At Michael expectantly

                       MICHAEL
          You told me that part already.

                       CAMERON
          Hell, I've just been going over the
          whole thing in my head and -

Joey appears over Cameron's shoulder.

                         JOEY
          Hey.    Dingo Boingo

Cameron and Michael look at each other And turn around
slowly

                       JOEY
                 (continuing; to
                 Michael)
          I hear you're helpin' Verona.

                          MICHAEL
          Uh,    yeah.   We're old friend*

                       JOEY
          You and Verona?

                      MICHAEL
          What? We took bathes together when we
          were kids.

It's incredibly obvious that he's lying.       Joey eyes him then
turns to Cameron.

                       JOEY
          What's your gig in all this?

                       CAMERON
          I'm just the new guy.

Joey turns back to Michael, grabbing the alligator on his
shirt and twisting it.

                       JOEY
          You better not fuck this up.       I'm
          heavily invested.

                       MICHAEL
          Hey -- it's all for the higher good
          right?

Joey lets go of Michael and SHOVES Cameron against a locker
for good measure, as he walks away-

                        CAMERON
           Is it about me?

EXT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY

Kat sits outside waiting for her appointment, bored and
annoyed.

The door opens and Miss Perky escorts Patrick out

                        MISS PERKY
           You're completely demented.

                        PATRICK
                  (cheery)
           See you next week!

Kat stands and Patrick sees her.

Miss Perky watches in horror

MISS PERKY
You two know each other?

                        PATRICK/KAT
           Yeah/No.

Miss Perky grabs Kat and shoves her into her office.

                        MISS PERKY
                  (to Patrick)
           Dear God, stay away from her. If you
           two ever decided to breed, evil would
           truly walk the earth.

Patrick gives Kat one last look before the door shuts, then
smiles-

EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT

The lights are on, illuminating the yard

INT.   STRATFORD HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Bianca and Chastity stand outside Kat's room. MUSIC is
blaring and the door is shut. Bianca looks at her watch

                        BIANCA
           She's obviously not going.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Across the carpet, two pairs of teenage girl feet sneak
past. Bianca and Chastity, teddy bear purses in hand.

FROM THE KITCHEN A RUSTLING is heard.    The girls freeze.

Walter emerges from the kitchen with a mile-high sandwich

The girls are like statues.   Walter jumps.

                        BIANCA
          Daddy, I --

                       WALTER
          And where're you going?

                       BIANCA
          If you must know, we were attempting to
          go to a small study group of friends.

                       WALTER
          Otherwise known as an orgy?

                       BIANCA
          It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew
          you'd forbid me to go since ""Gloria
          Steinem"" over there isn't going --

She points to Kat -- Walkman blaring -- who comes
downstairs, wearing a baby tee and battered Levis. Her
relaxing-at-home look is about 400 times sexier than her at-
school look. She wanders toward the kitchen.

Walter directs his attention toward Kat.

                       WALTER
          Do you know about any party? Katarina?

Kat shrugs as she comes back out of the kitchen with an
apple

                       BIANCA
          Daddy, people expect me to be there!

                       WALTER
          If Kat's not going, you're not going.

Bianca turns to Kat, eyes ablaze

                       BIANCA
          You're ruining my life' Because you
          won't be normal, I can't be normal.

                       KAT
          What's normal?

                       BIANCA
          Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but
          you're too busy listening to Bitches Who
          Need Prozac to know that.

                       WALTER
          What's a Bogey Lowenstein?

Kat takes off her earphones, ready to do battle

                        BIANCA

          Can't you forget for just one night
          that you're completely wretched?

                       KAT
          At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked
          hedge-pig.

Bianca tosses her hair.

                       BIANCA
          Like I'm supposed to know what that
          even means.

                       KAT
          It's Shakespeare.    Maybe you've heard
          of him?

                       BIANCA
          Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's
          boyfriend. I guess since I'm not
          allowed to go out, I should obsess over
          a dead guy, too.

                         WALTER
          Girls

Kat stares Bianca down

                       KAT
          I know about the goddamn party.    I'm
          going.

Bianca and Chastity look at each other, thrilled, and burst
into gleeful screams.

A startled Walter clutches Bianca in a protective hug.

                         WALTER
          Oh, God.    It's starting.

                       BIANCA
          It's just a party. Daddy.

Walter looks dazed.

                       WALTER
          Wear the belly before you go.

                         BIANCA
          Daddy, no!

                       WALTER
          Just for a minute

He rushes to a cupboard and pulls out a padded faux-
pregnancy belly.

                        WALTER
                  (continuing)

          I want you to realize the weight of
          your decisions.

He hangs the belly on her as she stands mortified.

                       BIANCA
          You are so completely unbalanced.

                       KAT
          Can we go now?

                       WALTER
                 (to Bianca)
          Promise me you won't talk to any boys
          unless your sister is present.

                         BIANCA
          Why?

                       WALTER
          Because she'll scare them away.

Kat stomps to the door, grabbing her car keys off the hall
table and a sweater from the coat rack. She flings open the
door and...

There stands Patrick.

                       PATRICK
          Nine-thirty right?

Kat's in shock

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          I'm early.

She holds up her keys

                         KAT
          I'm driving.

He peeks in behind her.

                       PATRICK
          Who knocked up your sister?

INT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

BOGEY, a short Future MBA in a tux, greets his guests like a
pro, handing out cigars and martinis.

                       BOGEY
          Nice to see you. Martini bar to the
          right, shots in the kitchen.

The house is filled to capacity with Padua High's finest Kat
pushes through the crowd. Patrick saunters in behind her

INT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Joey lines up a row of shots amid much whooping and
hollering within the jock crowd.

Kat enters, then quickly tries to make an about face. Joey
sees her and rushes over to block her, standing in the
doorway.

                       JOEY
          Lookin' fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat

Kat gives him a death look and then stops and points at his
forehead.

                       KAT
          Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline
          just recede?

He panics, whipping out a handy pocket mirror     She's
already walking away.

                       JOEY
          Where ya goin?

                       KAT
          Away.

                       JOEY
          Your sister here?

Kat's face shows utter hatred

                       KAT
          Leave my sister alone.

                       JOEY
                 (smirking)
          And why would I do that?

A RUCKUS sounds from the next room

                       JOCK
          A fight!

The other jocks rush to watch as two Coffee Kids splash
their cupfuls on each other.

                       COFFEE KID #1
          That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you
          Folger's-crystals-slurping-buttwipe.

Caffeinated fists fly. Joey slithers away from the door to
watch, giving Kat one last smirk, just as Bianca walks into
the kitchen.

                       JOEY
          Just who I was looking for.

He puts his arm around Bianca and escorts her out

                         KAT
                         BIANCA

Bianca keeps walking, ignoring Kat

A GUY pouring shots hands Kat one She downs it and accepts
another.

GUY
Drink up, sister.

Patrick walks up

                         PATRICK
          What's this?

                       KAT
                 (mocking)
          ""I'm getting trashed, man."" Isn't that
          what you're supposed to do at a party?

                       PATRICK
          I say, do what you wanna do.

                       KAT
          Funny, you're the only one

She downs another.

INT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Cameron and Michael enter. Cameron looks, around for his
beloved, while Michael schmoozee with all in attendance and
dishes dirt simultaneously.

                       MICHAEL
                 (high-fiving a
                 jock)
          Moose, my man!
                 (to Cameron)
          Ranked fifth in the state. Recruiters
          have already started calling.

Cameron nods intently

                        MICHAEL
                 (continuing;
                 grabbing his belt)
          Yo, Clem.
                 (to Cameron)
          A Patsy Cline fan, but hates the new
          Leanne Rimes.
                 (with a Jamaican

                 swagger)
          Ziggy, peace, bra.
                 (to Cameron)
          Prefers a water pipe, but has been
          known to use a bong.

Michael spots Bianca and Chastity, watching the skirmish,
and points Cameron's body in her direction.

                       MICHAEL
                 (continuing)
          Follow the love, man

ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY Bianca cranes her neck

                       BIANCA
          Where did he go? He was just here.

                       CHASTITY
          Who?

                       BIANCA
          Joey.

Cameron walks over.

                       CAMERON
          Evening, ladies.

Bianca turns and graces him with a pained smile.

                       BIANCA
          Hi.

                       CAMERON
          Looks like things worked out tonight,
          huh?

Bianca ignores the question and tries to pawn him off

                       BIANCA
          You know Chastity?

                       CAMERON
          I believe we share an art instructor

                       CHASTITY
          Great

                       BIANCA
          Would you mind getting me a drink,
          Cameron?

                      CAMERON
          Certainly
          Pabst? Old Milwaukee? RaiJieer?

Bianca gives him a tense smile.

                         BIANCA
          Surprise me.

He heads for the kitchen.    Joey walks up and grabs her
around the waist.

She giggles as he picks her up and carries her off -- just
as Cameron returns, a beer -- complete with a napkin and
straw -- in his hand.

Chastity glares with a jealous fury after Bianca and Joey,
then gives Cameron the once-over and walks away.

Michael appears.

                       MICHAEL
          Extremely unfortunate maneuver.

                       CAMERON
          The hell is that? What kind of 'guy
          just picks up a girl and carries her
          away while you're talking to her?

                       MICHAEL
          Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're
          making progress.

                       CAMERON
          No, I ' m not.

He smacks himself in the head

                       CAMERON
                 (continuing)
          She used me! She wants to go out with
          Dorsey. Not me. I'm an idiot!

Michael pats him on the shoulder.

                       MICHAEL
          At least you're self-aware

BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Kat and a crowd of White Rastas and Cowboys stand in a
drunken group hug singing ""I Shot the Sheriff"". Kat has
another shot glass in hand.

Patrick is showing a scar to an inebriated, enraptured
cheerleader. He looks up at Kat and smiles meets his eyes
then looks away.

INT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Bianca stands next to Joey, sipping from her beer

                       JOEY
          So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog
          thing going -- and the tube sock gig ""

          that's gonna be huge. And then I'm up
          for an ad for Queen Harry next week.

                         BIANCA
          Queen Harry?

                       JOEY
          It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be,
          like, wearing a uniform and stuff.

Bianca tries to appear impressed, but it's getting
difficult.

                         BIANCA
          Neat...

                       JOEY
          My agent says I've got a good shot at
          being the Prada guy next year.

He looks over her shoulder and waves at someone.    Bianca
takes the opportunity to escape.

                       BIANCA
          I'll be right back.

INT. BOGEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Bianca shuts the door and leans on it with a sigh.    Chastity
applies lip-gloss in the mirror.

                        BIANCA
          He practically proposed when he found
          out we had the same dermatologist. I
          mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all,
          but he's not exactly relevant party
          conversation.

                       CHASTITY
          Is he oily or dry?

                       BIANCA
          Combination. I don't know -- I thought
          he'd be different. More of a
          gentleman...

Chastity rolls her eyes

                       CHASTITY
          Bianca, I don't think the highlights of
          dating Joey Dorsey are going to include
          door-opening and coat-holding.

                       BIANCA
          Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're
          supposed to want to go out with are the
          ones we actually want to go out with,
          you know?

                       CHASTITY
          All I know is -- I'd give up my private
          line to go out with a guy like Joey.

There's a KNOCK at the door.    Bianca opens it to find a very
drunken Kat.

                       KAT
          Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need
          to tell you --

                       BIANCA
                 (cutting her off)
          I really don't think I need any social
          advice from you right now.

Bianca grabs Chastity's arm and they exit

INT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER

Patrick tries to remove a shot glass from Kat's hand.

                       PATRICK

Maybe you should let me have it.

Kat is fierce in her refusal to let go

                       KAT
          I want another one

Joey enters, grabbing Patrick by the shoulder, distracting
him from his task.

                       JOEY
          My man

As Patrick turns, Kat breaks free and dives into the sea of
dancing people in the dining room.

                       PATRICK
                 (annoyed)
          It's about time.

                       JOEY
          A deal's a deal.

He peels off some bills

                       JOEY
                 (continuing)
          How'd you do it?

                       PATRICK
          Do what?

                       JOEY
          Get her to act like a human

A very drunken Kat jumps up onto the kitchen island and
starts dancing by herself. She lets loose, hair flying.
She's almost burlesque.

Others form a crowd, clapping and cheering her on

She swings her head around BANGING it on a copper pot
hanging from the rack above the center island. She starts
to sway, then goes down as Patrick rushes over to catch her.

The others CLAP, thinking this is a wonderful finale.
Patrick sets her down on her feet, holding her up

                       PATRICK
          Okay?

                       KAT
          I'm fine. I'm

She tries to push him away, but staggers when she does grabs
her again, bracing her.

                       PATRICK
          You're not okay.

                       KAT
          I just need to lie down for awhile

                       PATRICK
          Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to
          sleep

                       KAT
          I know, just let me sleep

                       PATRICK
          What if you have a concussion? My dog
          went to sleep with a concussion and woke
          up a vegetable. Not that I could tell
          the difference...

She tries to sit on the floor

                       KAT
          Okay, I'll just sleep but stay awake,
          okay?

He pulls her back to her

                       PATRICK
          C'mon, let's walk

INT. BOGEY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

As Patrick walks Kat through the dining room, Cameron   grabs
his arm.

CAMERON We need to talk.

                       PATRICK
          Cameron, I'm a little busy

                       CAMERON
          It's off. The whole thing.

Kat slides down to the floor and Patrick struggles to   get h
back on her feet.

                       PATRICK
          What 're you talking about?

                       CAMERON
          She's partial to Joey, not me

Patrick doesn't have time for this.

                       PATRICK
          Cameron -- do you like the girl?

                       CAMERON
          Sure

                       PATRICK
                 (impatient)
          Then, go get her

Patrick continues walking an oblivious Kat outside. Cameron
stands there, unsure how to make use of this advice

EXT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Patrick marches Kat around the yard, holding her up

                       KAT
          This is so patronizing.

                       PATRICK
          Leave it to you to use big words when
          you're shitfaced.

                       KAT
          Why 're you doing this?

                       PATRICK
          I told you

                       KAT
          You don't care if I die

                       PATRICK
          Sure, I do

                       KAT
          Why?

                       PATRICK
          Because then I'd have to start taking
          out girls who like me.

                       KAT
          Like you could find one

                       PATRICK
          See that? Who needs affection when
          I've got blind hatred?

                       KAT
          Just let me sit down.

He walks her over to the swingset and plops her down in a
swing, moving her hands to hang onto the chains.

                        PATRICK
          How's that?

She sits and looks at him for a moment with a smile. Then
FALLS over backward.

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          Jesus. You're like a weeble

Patrick rushes to right her, then starts pushing her on the
swing to keep her entertained.

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          Why'd you let him get to you?

                        KAT
          Who?

                        PATRICK
          Dorsey.

                        KAT
          I hate him.

                       PATRICK
          I know. It'd have to be a pretty big
          deal to get you to mainline tequila. You
          don't seem like the type.

                       KAT
                 (holding up a
                 drunken head)
          Hey man. . . You don ' t think I can
          be ""cool""? You don't think I can be
          ""laid back"" like everyone else?

                       PATRICK
                 (slightly
                 sarcastic)
          I thought you were above all that

                       KAT
          You know what they say

He stops the swing

                       PATRICK
          No. What do they say?

Kat is asleep, her head resting against the swing's chains.

                        PATRICK
                  (continuing)
          Shit!

He drags her to her feet and starts singing loudly.

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          Jingle Bells! Jingle Belles! Wake up
          damn it!

He sits her down on the slide and shakes her like a rag
doll.

                        PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          Kat! Wake up!

                        KAT
                  (waking)
          What?

He sighs with relief.

                       PATRICK
          I thought you were...

They share some meaningful eye contact. And then she PUKES
on his shoes.

INT. BOGEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Kat washes her face and grabs a bottle of Scope, taking a
big swig.

A KNOCK sounds at the door

                        KAT
          Go away

Bianca opens the door and looks at her sister with the
smuggest of all possible grins.

                       BIANCA
          Dinner taste better on the way out?

Gives her a ""don't even start"" look.

                       BIANCA
                 (continuing)
          I don't get you. You act like you're

          too good for any of this, and then you
          go totally apeshit when you get here.

                       KAT
          You're welcome.

She pushes past her and leaves the bathroom.

KAT'S CAR - NIGHT

Kat's in the driver's seat.    Patrick leans in and takes the
keys out of the ignition.

                       PATRICK
          Cute

BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kids loiter on the lawn.   Bianca and Chastity walk outside
Joey catches up to them.

                       JOEY
          A bunch of us are going to Jaret's
          house. Wanna come?

Chastity looks at Bianca, who wears a pained expression.
She looks at her watch.

                       BIANCA
          I have to be home in twenty minutes.

                       CHASTITY
                 (eagerly, to Joey)
          I don't have to be home 'til two.

                       JOEY
          Then, c'mon.
                 (to Bianca)
          Maybe next time --

They head back into the party, leaving an astonished Bianca

Cameron exits the party and stops when he sees Bianca
standing alone.

                       CAMERON
                 (slightly
                 accusatory)
          Have fun tonight?

                       BIANCA
          Tons

He starts to walk on

                       BIANCA
                 (continuing)
          Cameron?

He stops. She gives him a helpless smile.

                       BIANCA
                 (continuing)
          Do you think you could give me a ride
          home?

INT. KAT'S CAR - NIGHT

Patrick drives as Kat sits in the passenger seat, fiddling
with the radio dial. She finds a SONG she's happy with and
Patrick quickly changes it.

                       PATRICK
          I'm driving, so I get to pick the
          tunes.

She changes it back to her song.

                         KAT
          It's my car.

He changes it back.

                       PATRICK
          And I'm in control of it.

                       KAT
          But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like
          them. I saw you there.

Patrick doesn't have an answer for this, so he let's her
listen to her song.

                       KAT
                 (continuing)
          When you were gone last year -- where
          were you?

                         PATRICK
          Busy

                       KAT
          Were you in jail?

                         PATRICK
          Maybe.

                       KAT
          No, you weren't

                       PATRICK
          Then why'd you ask?

                       KAT
          Why'd you lie?

He doesn't answer, but instead, frowns and turns up the
music. She bobs her head drunkenly.

                       KAT
                 (continuing)
          I should do this.

                       PATRICK
          Do what?

                       KAT
          This.

She points to the radio

                       PATRICK
          Start a band?

                       KAT
                 (sarcastically)
          My father wouldn't approve of that that

                       PATRICK
          You don't strike me as the type that
          would ask permission.

She turns to look at him.

                       KAT
          Oh, so now you think you know me?

                       PATRICK
          I'm gettin' there

Her voice loses it's venom

                       KAT
          The only thing people know about me is
          that I'm ""scary"".

He turns to look at her -- she looks anything but scary
right now. He tries to hide his smile.

                       PATRICK

Yeah -- well, I'm no picnic myself.

They eye each other, sharing a moment of connection,
realizing they're both created the same exterior for
themselves.

Patrick pulls into her driveway and shuts off the motor.   He
looks up at her house.

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          So what ' s up with your dad?   He a
          pain in the ass?

                       KAT
          He just wants me to be someone I'm not.

                         PATRICK
          Who?

                         KAT
                         BIANCA

                       PATRICK
          No offense, but you're sister is
          without. I know everyone likes her and
          all, but ...

Kat stares at him with new admiration.

                       KAT
          You know -- you're not as vile as I
          thought you were.

She leans drunkenly toward him.

Their faces grow closer as if they're about to kiss And then
Patrick turns away

                       PATRICK
          So, I'll see you in school

Kat stares at him, pissed. Then gets out of the car,
SLAMMING the door shut behind her.

CAMERON'S CAR - NIGHT

Bianca and Cameron ride in silence.
He finally breaks it.

                       CAMERON
          I looked for you back at the party, but
          you always seemed to be ""occupied"".

                         BIANCA
                   (faux-innocence )
          I was?

                       CAMERON
          You never wanted to go out with 'me,
          did you?

Bianca bites her lip.

                       BIANCA
                 (reluctant)
          Well, no...

                       CAMERON
          Then that's all you had to say.

                         BIANCA
          But

                         CAMERON

          You always been this selfish?

BIANCA thinks a minute

He pulls up in front of the house

                        CAMERON
          Just because you're beautiful, doesn't
          mean you can treat people like they
          don't matter.

She looks at him for a moment -- then grabs his face and
gives him a kiss on the lips. He draws back in surprise,
then kisses her back. She smiles, then gets out of the car
without another word.

Cameron grins and drives away

                       CAMERON
                 (continuing)
          And I'm back in the saddle.

INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

Kat sits at her desk, burying her face in a book as the
others enter. The White Rastas are first.

                       DEREK
          Kat, my lady, you sway to the rhythm of
          my heart.

He grabs her hand and kisses it as she pulls it away.

CLEM, a cowboy, enters, high-fiving Derek with new-found
friendliness.

                       CLEM
          Yippe kai-aye, bra.
                 (to Kat)
          Dance for me, cowgirl.

He sits next to Derek

                       CLEM
                 (continuing)
          Okay, now tell me again why he didn't
          shoot the deputy?

                       DEREK
          Because the deputy meant him no harm,
          my friend. It was only the sheriff that
          was the oppressor.

Joey saunters in and takes his seat.

                       JOEY
          Kat, babe, you were on fire.

Mrs. Blaise enters and sits at her desk

                       MRS. BLAISE
          Well now, did everyone have a good
          weekend?

                       JOEY
          Maybe we should ask Verona

Patrick enters, late, and slinks to his desk.   Kat looks up,
down and around, everywhere but at Patrick.

Mrs. Blaise tries to remember what she's supposed to talk
about.

                         MRS. BLAISE
          Okay then. Well.
                  (beat)
          Oh, yes

She clears her throat.

                       MRS. BLAISE
                 (continuing)
          I'd like you all to write your own
          version of Shakespeare's Sonnet #141.

Groans.

                       MRS. BLAISE
                 (continuing)
          Any form you'd like. Rhyme, no rhyme,
          whatever. I'd like to see you elaborate
          on his theme, however. Let's read it
          aloud, shall we? Anyone?

The class is frozen in apathy.

                         MRS. BLAISE
                   (continuing)
          Derek?

Ms. Blaise hands him the sonnet. He shifts uncomfortably in
his seat. Then grins.

                       DEREK
                 (reading; in his
                 Rasta stoner drawl)
          In faith, I do not love thee with mine
          eyes/ For they in thee a thousand errors
          note/ But 'tis my heart that loves what
          they despise/ Who in despite of view is
          pleas 'd to dote.

In the back of the room Clem raises his hand

                       CLEM
          Ms. Blaise, can I get the bathroom
          pass? Damn if Shakespeare don't act as
          a laxative on my person.

INT. KENNY'S THAI FOOD DINER - DAY
Kat and Mandella scrape the peanuts out of their sauce.

                       MANDELLA
          You went to the party? I thought we
          were officially opposed to suburban
          social activity.

                       KAT
          I didn't have a choice.

                       MANDELLA
          You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat
          and what have you done with her?

                       KAT
          I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.

                       MANDELLA
          You didn't

                       KAT
          I got drunk. I puked.     I got rejected.
          It was big fun.

Patrick enters, walking to the counter to order. He sees Kat
and smiles.

                       PATRICK
          Hey

She gathers her things and bolts out the door.    Patrick
looks at Mandella, who shrugs and follows Kat.

INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY Cameron and Michael flank Patrick
at his lab table

                       MICHAEL
          So you got cozy with she who stings?

                       PATRICK
          No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that
          I'm about to lose.

                       CAMERON
          What'd you do to her?

                        PATRICK
          I don ' t know.
                 (beat)
          I decided not to nail her when she was
          too drunk to remember it.

Michael and Cameron look at each other in realization, then
turn back to Patrick.

                       CAMERON

You realize this puts the whole operation in peril.

                          PATRICK

No shit.   She won't even look at me

                          CAMERON

Why can't you just tell her you're sorry?

Patrick's expression says that this is not a possibility.
Michael makes a time out sign with his hands.

                          MICHAEL
           I'm on it

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Mandella is at her locker. Drawings of William Shakespeare
adorn the door. She looks at them with a sigh, then ties
her silk scarf tightly around her neck, in an attempt to cut
off her air supply.

Michael walks up.

                          MICHAEL
           Hey there.    Tired of breathing?

                          MANDELLA
                    (shyly, as she
                    loosens the scarf)
           Hi.

                        MICHAEL
           Cool pictures. You a fan?

                          MANDELLA
           Yeah.    I guess.

MICHAEL rocks.     Very hip.

                          MANDELLA
           You think?

                          MICHAEL
           Oh yeah.

She looks at him suspiciously

                        MANDELLA
           Who could refrain that had a heart to
           love and in that heart, courage to make
           ' B love known?

Michael thinks for a minute.

                        MICHAEL
           Macbeth, right?

                         MANDELLA
                   (happily stunned)
          Right.

                       MICHAEL
          Kat a fan, too?

                         MANDELLA
                   (puzzled)
          Yeah...

He leans in close to her, conspiratorially

                       MICHAEL
          So, listen... I have this friend

EXT. FIELD HOCKEY FIELD - DAY

Cameron sits next to Patrick on the bleachers as they watch
Kat's practice.

                       CAMERON
          She hates you with the fire of a
          thousand suns . That's a direct quote

                       PATRICK
          She just needs time to cool off I'll
          give it a day.

A PUCK flies at them from the field, narrowly missing their
heads.

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          Maybe two.

He looks at Cameron.

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          You makin' any headway?

                       CAMERON
          She kissed me.

                         PATRICK
                   (eyebrow raised)
          Where?

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Chastity rounds the corner and bends down to get a drink
from the water fountain.

NEARBY

Joey stands talking to two JOCK COHORTS.   The guys don't see
her.

                       JOEY
          Don't talk to me about the sweetest
          date. That little halo Bianca is gonna
          be prone and proven on prom night. Six
          virgins in a row.

The cohorts chortle Chastity keeps drinking from the
fountain

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Joey leans against Patrick's Jeep.   Patrick is inside.

                       PATRICK
          I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the
          flowers. Another hundred for the tux --

                       JOEY
          Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I
          know.

He pulls out his wallet and hands Patrick a wad of money

                       JOEY
                 (continuing)
          Take it

Patrick does, with a smile, as he ROARS out of the parking
lot.

INT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY

Kat and Mandella deface a prom flyer.

                       KAT
          Can you even imagine? Who the hell
          would go to this a bastion of commercial
          excess?

                       MANDELLA
          Well, I guess we're not, since we don't
          have dates .

                       KAT
          Listen to you! You sound like Betty,
          all pissed off because Archie is taking
          Veronica.

                       MANDELLA
          Okay, okay, we won't go.   It's not like
          I have a dress anyway

                       KAT
          You ' re looking at this from the wrong
          perspective. We're making a statement.

                       MANDELLA
                 (unconvinced)
          Oh, good. Something new and different

          for us.

EXT. ARCHERY FIELD - DAY

Mr. Chapin patrols as boys and girls shoot arrows at targets

Joey swaggers up to Bianca, who is taking careful aim.
Chastity watches from across the row.

                       JOEY
          Hey, sweet cheeks.

                       BIANCA
                 (not looking at
                 him)
          Hi, Joey.

                       JOEY
          You're concentrating awfully hard
          considering it's gym class.

She lets the arrow go and turns to look at him.

                       JOEY
                 (continuing)
          Listen, I want to talk to you about the
          prom.

                        BIANCA
          You know the deal. I can ' t go if Kat
          doesn't go --

In the background, a RASTA crumples to the ground.    Hit
A casualty of Gym. Mr. Chapin scurries over.

                       JOEY
          Your sister is going.

Bianca looks at him, surprised

                        BIANCA
          Since when?

Joey takes the bow and arrow from Bianca's hand.    He draws
back and takes aim.

                       JOEY
          I'm taking care of it.

Chastity looks over from her spot on the field, but keeps
lips firmly shut.

INT. BOOK STORE - DAY

Kat browses through the feminist lit section
Patrick appears, through a hole in the books.

                       PATRICK
          Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine

          Mystique?    I lost my copy.

                       KAT
                 (frowning)
          What are you doing here?

                       PATRICK
          I heard there was a poetry reading.

                         KAT
          You 're so --

                         PATRICK
          Pleasant?

Kat stares at him, deadpan.

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          Wholesome.

                         KAT
          Unwelcome.

                       PATRICK
          Unwelcome? I guess someone still has
          her panties in a twist.

                       KAT
          Don't for one minute think that you had
          any effect whatsoever on my panties.

                       PATRICK
          So what did I have an effect on ?

                       KAT
          Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.

She pushes past him and heads out the' door
Pat looks down at the book he's been holding in his hand:
Taming of the Shrew.

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

Cameron   and Michael flank Patrick as he shovels food into
mouth.

                       PATRICK
          You were right. She's still pissed.

                       MICHAEL
          Sweet love, renew thy force!

                       PATRICK
          Man -- don't say shit like that to    me.
          People can hear you.

                       CAMERON
                 (exasperated)

           You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice
           yourself on the altar of dignity and
           even the score.

                        MICHAEL
           Best case scenario, you're back on the
           payroll for awhile.

                        PATRICK
           What's the worst?

                        CAMERON
           You get the girl.

Patrick   thinks for a minute

                        PATRICK
           If I go down. I'm takin' her with me

INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

Kat and the other students sit at their desks, taking a quiz
Patrick's seat is conspicuously empty.

From outside, we hear the soft, unsure beginnings of a SONG.
Kat looks up, then out the window, HORRIFIED.

The song grows louder until we realize it's The Partridge
Family's ""I Think I Love You"". Being sung by Patrick.

                        PATRICK
                  (0. S.)
           ""This morning, I woke up with this
           feeling, I didn't know how to deal with,
           and so I just decided to myself--""

The STUDENTS rush to the window. OUTSIDE Patrick stands
beneath the window, crooning.

Scurvy is next to him, keeping the beat on the bongos and
doing backup vocal s.

                        PATRICK
           ""I'd hide it to myself. And never talk
           about it. And didn't I go and shout it
           when you walked into the room --""

He makes quite a sarcastic show of it.

IN THE CLASSROOM

Mrs. Blaise touches her heart, as if the song is for her.
Kat slowly walks to the window, peeking below.

OUTSIDE

Patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big
finale.

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          "" I think I love you I ""

INSIDE

The other students laugh, clap, cheer, etc. Kat sinks down,
mortified, but with a slight smile

INT. DETENTION HALL - DAY

Patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly, mulling
over their misfortune.

                       MISCREANT
          Nice song, Verona.

                       PATRICK
          Flog me.

He makes the appropriate hand gesture

Mr. Chapin, the gym teacher, sits at the desk in front,
ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine

                       KAT (0. S.)
          Excuse me, Mr. Chapin?

Patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees Kat
standing in the doorway. She gives him a smile and he perks
up a little.

Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr. Chapin again. He
turns fully to face her.

                       KAT
          Sir, I'd like to state for the record
          that Mr. Verona ' s current
          incarceration is unnecessary. I never
          filed a complaint.

                       MR. CHAPIN
          You didn't have to. He disrupted a
          classroom.

Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the
window.

Patrick shrugs, not knowing what she ' s talking about.

She motions again, and looks toward the window with an
expression that says, ""Make a break for it, moron.""

Kat brings her attention back to Mr. Chapin while Patrick
inches out of his seat toward the window.

The other miscreants watch with glee.

                       KAT

          But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a
          simple serenade warrants a week of
          detention. There are far more hideous
          acts than off-key singing being
          performed by the student body on a
          regular basis.

Patrick is halfway out the window now. And none too happy
about it, considering they're on the second floor.

He eyes a large TREE a few feet away from MR. CHAPIN.   He
starts to turn away from Kat

                       MR. CHAPIN
          You're not gonna change my mind, Kat.
          Rules stick.

Kat starts to panic, as Patrick has yet to make the jump for
the tree.

                       KAT
          Wait, Mr. Chapin. There's something
          I've always wanted to show you.

He turns back toward her again, the very second before he
would have spotted Patrick.

Kat glances toward the window.   Patrick's just about to make
the jump.

                       MR. CHAPIN
          What?

                       KAT
          These.

From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra
at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump.

The miscreants cheer, for both the daring' escape and the
flash of skin.

Mr. Chapin reddens and tries to be stern.

                       MR. CHAPIN
          I'm going to let that slide, Katarina.
          But if I catch you doing that again,
          you'll be in here with the rest of these
          guys.

He motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without
noticing Patrick's absence.

Kat smiles at him.

                       KAT
          Thank you, Mr. Chapin.

Kat bolts out the door.   Mr. Chapin goes back to his muscle

mag, wiping the sweat from his brow.

EXT. SCHOOL CAMPUS LAWN

Kat arrives at the tree. looking around breathlessly, seeing
no one.

                         KAT
            He left! I sprung the dickhead and he
            cruised on me.

                         PATRICK
                   (0. S.)
            Look up, sunshine

She does.    He's still in the tree

                         PATRICK
            I guess I never told you I'm afraid of
            heights.

                         KAT
                   (smiling)
            C'mon. It's not that bad

                         PATRICK
            Try lookin' at it from this angle

She assesses the branch structure

                         KAT
            Put your right foot there --

                           PATRICK
            Forget it.    I'm stayin'.

                         KAT
            You want me to climb up and show you
            how to get down?

                           PATRICK
                     (voice trembling)
            Maybe.

She sighs and dose so. When she gets to his level, she
perches on the branch next to him. He grins at her.

Then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a
monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she's been
duped.

                           KAT
            You shit!

She climbs down after him

EXT. OUTDOOR ARCADE - DAY

Patrick and Kat walk amongst the games

                      KAT
         The Partridge Family?

                       PATRICK
         I figured it had to be something
         ridiculous to win your respect. And
         piss you off.

                      KAT
         Good call.

                      PATRICK
         So how'd you get Chapin to look the
         other way?

                      KAT
         I dazzled him with my wit

She stops and picks up a toy gun that SHOOTS water at
giggling hyenas and wails on it. The barker hands her a
stuffed animal as her prize. She hands it to the small KID
next to her and they continue walking.

                      PATRICK
                (sarcastic)
         A soft side? Who knew?

                      KAT
         Yeah, well, don't let it get out

                      PATRICK
         So what's your excuse?

                      KAT
         Acting the way we do.

                      PATRICK
         Yes

                      KAT
         I don't like to do what people expect.
         Then they expect it all the time and
         they get disappointed when you change.

                      PATRICK
         So if you disappoint them from the
         start, you're covered?

                      KAT
         Something like that

                      PATRICK
         Then you screwed up

                      KAT
         How?

                      PATRICK

          You never disappointed me.

She blushes under his gaze

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          You up for it?

                       KAT
          For. . . ?

He motions to the SIGN for a paint-ball game. She grins
SERIES OF SHOTS:

The two of them creep through the paint-ball course,
stealthy and full of the desire to best the other.

Patrick nails Kat in the back with a big glob of red paint
Kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue.

Patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of
her face.

Kat squirts a green shot to his forehead After a few more
shots, they're both covered in paint

She tries to shoot him again, only to find that her gun is
empty.

                       KAT
                 (continuing)
          Damn it!

Patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle.   They land,
laughing.

It's hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces
are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to
find each other's eyes.

He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips,   as he
goes to kiss her.

NEARBY The kid with the stuffed animal, points

                       KID
          Look, Mom

His mother hurries him away. What's started as a tackle has
turned into a passionate kiss

EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT

Patrick pulls up in Kat's driveway. Their paint wardrobe
has dried by now and they look like refugees from some
strange, yet colorful, war.

                       KAT
          State trooper?

                         PATRICK
          Fallacy.

                         KAT
          The duck?

                         PATRICK
          Hearsay.

                       KAT
          I know the porn career's a lie.

He shuts off the car and turns to her.

                         PATRICK
          Do you?

He kisses her neck.   It tickles.    She laughs.

                       KAT
          Tell me something true.

                         PATRICK
          I hate peas.

                       KAT
          No -- something real.     Something no one
          else knows.

                       PATRICK
                 (in-between kisses)
          You're sweet. And sexy. And
          completely hot for me.

                         KAT
          What?

                       PATRICK
          No one else knows

                       KAT
          You're amazingly self-assured. Has
          anyone ever told you that?

                       PATRICK
          Go to the prom with me

Kat's smile disappears.

                       KAT
          Is that a request or a command?

                       PATRICK
          You know what I mean

                         KAT
          No.

                         PATRICK
          No what?

                       KAT
          No, I won't go with you

                         PATRICK
          Why not?

                       KAT
          Because I don't want to. It's a stupid
          tradition.

Patrick sits quietly, torn. He can't very well tell her he
being paid to take her.

                       PATRICK
          People won't expect you to go...

Kat turns to him, getting angry.

                       KAT
          Why are you doing this?

                       KAT
          All of it -- what's in it for you?

He sits silently, not looking at her, confirming her
suspicions.

                       KAT
                 (continuing)
          Create a little drama?    Start a new
          rumor? What?

                       PATRICK
          So I have to have a motive to be with
          you?

                         KAT
          You tell me.

                       PATRICK
          You need therapy. Has anyone ever told
          you that?

                       KAT
                 (quietly)
          Answer the question, Patrick

                       PATRICK
                 (angry)
          Nothing! There's nothing in it for me.
          Just the pleasure of your company.

He takes out a cigarette. She breaks it in half before she
SLAMS the car door and walks into the house.

Patrick PEELS out of the driveway. Kat turns at the front

door and watches him go

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Patrick pulls up to a stop light and waits for .the green

He glances over at A DRUNKEN HOMELESS GUY in the median, who
has decided that he doesn't need to wear pants.

Patrick pulls out his wallet, takes the wad of money Joey
gave him and hands it to the homeless guy.

                        PATRICK
          cover that up

The light turns green and Patrick pulls away

INT. STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT

Kat stands at the sink, scrubbing paint off of her face
Bianca TAPS on the open door.

                       BIANCA
          Quick question -- are you going to the
          prom?

Kat pushes the door shut with a SLAM

INT. STUDY HALL - DAY

Cameron and Bianca sit together at their study cubby.    She
fingers a strand of her hair.

                       BIANCA
          Then Guillermo says, ""If you go any
          lighter, you're gonna look like an extra
          on 90210.""

                        CAMERON
          No...

Bianca stares at him for a moment.

                       BIANCA
          do you listen to this crap?

                        CAMERON
          What crap?

                       BIANCA
          Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm
          like, boring myself.

                       CAMERON
          Thank God! If I had to hear one more
          story about your coiffure...

He mock stabs himself with a pencil as she giggles and
smacks his hand away.

                       CAMERON
                 (continuing)
          I figured you'd get to the good stuff
          eventually.

                       BIANCA
          What good stuff?

                       CAMERON
          The ""real you"".

                       BIANCA
          Like my fear of wearing pastels?

He looks stricken.

                        BIANCA
                 (continuing)
          I'm kidding.
                 (beat)
          You know how sometimes you just become
          this ""persona""? And you don't know how
          to quit?

                         CAMERON
                   (matter of fact)
          No

                       BIANCA
          Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how
          to lie.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Mandella struggles with the lock on her locker.    Finally, it
opens.

Hanging inside is a beautiful DRESS, inspired by the 16th
Century. Mandella slowly unpins a NOTE from the dress.

INSERT - ""0 FAIR ONE. JOIN ME AT THE PROM.     I WILL BE
WAITING. LOVE, WILLIAM S.""

Mandella's agog.    Trevor walks by and sees her holding the
dress.

                       TREVOR
          You're gonna look splendiferous in
          that, Mandella.

Mandella looks up sharply, shaken from her reverie.

                       TREVOR
                 (continuing)
          that's cool to say.

Mandella grins It is

                        MANDELLA

INT. STRATFORD HOUSE/DEN - DAY

Sharon is at her computer, Walter at his exercise bike

                       SHARON
          Would you rather be ravished by a
          pirate or a British rear admiral?

                       WALTER
          Pirate -- no question.

Bianca enters and walks over to Walter

                       BIANCA
          Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with
          you. It's tomorrow night --

                        WALTER
          The prom?   Kat has a date?

                        BIANCA
          No, but

                       WALTER
          It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s
          who you want me to bend my rules for?

                       BIANCA
          He's not a ""hot rod"".    Whatever that
          is.

                       WALTER
          You're not going unless your sister
          goes. End of story.

                      BIANCA
          Fine. I see that I'm a prisoner in my
          own house. I'm not a daughter. I'm a
          possession!

Bianca storms out.

                       WALTER
                 (calling out)
          You know what happens at proms?

Sharon stops her typing and looks up at Walter

                       SHARON
          They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll
          come home. Let her go.

                       WALTER
          Kissing? Is that what you think
          happens? Kissing isn't what keeps me up
          to my elbows in placenta all day.

INT. BIANCA'S ROOM - NIGHT

Bianca lies on her bed.     MTV blares.   A KNOCK sounds.

BIANCA
Come in.

Kat enters and sits down on the bed, muting the TV.

                        KAT
                  (kindly)
           Listen, I know you hate having to sit
           home because I'm not Susie High School.

                        BIANCA
           Like you care.

                        KAT
           I do care. But I'm a firm believer in
           doing something for your own reasons,
           not someone else ' s .

                        BIANCA
           I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only
           sophomore that got asked to the prom and
           I can't go, because you won ' t.

Kat clears her throat

                        KAT
           Joey never told you we went out, did
           he?

                          BIANCA
           What?

                          KAT
           In 9th.    For a month

                         BIANCA
                   (confused)
           Why?

                        KAT
                  (self-mocking)
           He was, like, a total babe

                        BIANCA
           But you hate Joey

                          KAT
           Now I do.    Back then, was a different
           story.

                          BIANCA
           As in...

Kat takes a deep breath.

                       KAT
          He said everyone was doing it.   So I
          did it.

                       BIANCA
          You did what?

                       KAT
                 (continuing on)
          Just once. Afterwards, I told him I
          didn't want to anymore. I wasn't ready.
          He got pissed. Then he broke up with
          me.

Bianca stares at her, dumbfounded

                       BIANCA
          But

                       KAT
          After that, I swore I'd never do
          anything just because ""everyone else""
          was doing it. And I haven't since.
          Except for Bogey's party, and my
          stunning gastro-intestinal display --

                       BIANCA
                 (stunned)
          Why didn't you tell me?

                       KAT
          I wanted to let you make up your own
          mind about him.

                       BIANCA
          No. you didn't! If you really thought
          I could make my own decisions, you
          would've let me go out with him instead
          of helping Daddy hold me hostage.

Kat stands up slowly

                       KAT
          That's not

                       BIANCA
          I'm not stupid enough to repeat your
          mistakes.

                       KAT
          I guess I thought I was protecting you.

                       BIANCA
          God, you're just like him! Just keep me
          locked away in the dark, so I can't
          experience anything for myself

                       KAT
          Not all experiences are good, Bianca.

          You can't always trust the people you
          want to.

                       BIANCA
          I guess I'll never know, will I?

She rises and holds the door open for Kat, then slams it
behind her.

EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY

A sprinkler cruises the lawn.

INT. KAT'S ROOM - DAY

Kat lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.   She rolls over and
picks up the phone.

BIANCA'S ROOM - DAY

Bianca, still in her pajamas, eats a bowl of cereal while
watching ""I Love Lucy"" reruns.

A KNOCK sounds

                        BIANCA
          Come in.

Kat opens the door and peers in with a grin

                       KAT
          Feel like shopping?

Bianca looks up, hopefully.

LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Walter and Sharon are in front of the television.   Walter
has the TV Guide in hand, glasses on.

                       WALTER
          What do you wanna watch?   We've got
          crap, crap, crap or crap

                        SHARON
          Dr. Ruth?

Bianca walks into the living room.   She's wearing a prom
dress.

                       BIANCA
          Hi, Mommy.
                 (looking away)
                       WALTER

Walter scurries takes off his glasses and looks from Bianca
to Sharon.

                        SHARON

          Honey, you look beautiful!

                        BIANCA
          You like?   My date should be here in
          five.

                       WALTER
          I'm missing something.

                       BIANCA
          I have a date, Daddy. And he ' s not a
          captain of oppression like some men we
          know.

The DOORBELL RINGS. Bianca runs to open it.    There stands
CAMERON. He takes in Bianca's outfit.

                        CAMERON
          Wow

                        BIANCA
          Let's go.

Walter rises.   Sharon pulls him back down on the couch

                       SHARON
                 (to Bianca)
          Have a great time, honey!

                       WALTER
          But -- who -- what --?

The door SLAMS. As Sharon looks at Walter with a grin, a
blur rushes down the stairs and out the door. The blur has
Kat ' s voice.

                        KAT
          Hey, guys. I'm going to the prom. See
          you in a few.

The door SLAMS again.   Walter and Sharon 'are alone

                       WALTER
          What just happened?

                       SHARON
          Your daughters went to the prom.

                       WALTER
          Did I have anything to say about it?

                       SHARON
          Absolutely not.

                       WALTER
          That ' s what I thought

The DOORBELL RINGS again. Walter opens it to find Joey on
the porch, wearing a tux.

                         JOEY
            I'm here to pick up Bianca.

                           WALTER
            late

He SLAMS the door shut

EXT    HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Kat pulls up in her car, emerging resplendent in an ice
gown.

Patrick sits on the steps, waiting.      In a tux.

                         KAT
            How'd you get a tux at the last minute?

                         PATRICK
            It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted.
            Where'd you get the dress?

                         KAT
            It's just something I had.    You know

                           PATRICK
                     (smiling)
            Oh huh

                         KAT
            Look, I'm -- sorry -- that I
            questioned your motives. I was wrong.

Patrick winces slightly, but covers it with a smile

                           PATRICK
            No prob.

He remains seated.      Kat fidgets nervously.

                         KAT
            are you ready?

He rises and stares at her, taking in her image
appreciatively. She blushes and turns away.

                         KAT
                   (continuing)
            C'mon. Let's get this over with.

INT.    PROM - NIGHT

A hotel ballroom transformed into a fantasy world. Patrick
and Kat enter, Kat attempting to deny the romance of it.

                         KAT
            Quite the ostentatious display

A cowboy two-steps by them, dragging some poor girl around

                        PATRICK
           Look, Clem even wore his good boots

Kat steps forward, looking around and spots Cameron and
Bianca dancing cheek to cheek. She smiles.

ACROSS THE ROOM

Mandella enters nervously, in the long Elizabethan gown,
hair piled on top of her head. She spots Kat and hurries
over.

                        MANDELLA
           Have you seen him?

                        KAT
           Who?

                        MANDELLA
           William - he asked me to meet him here.

                        KAT
           Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't'
           progressed to full-on hallucinations.

Patrick looks toward the door and taps Kat.   She turns and
points Mandella the same way.

Michael - in full Shakespearean dress with a new goatee on
his chin - bows in their direction. Mandella's grin couldn't
be bigger.

Michael swashbuckles over to them, taking Mandella's hand
and leading her onto the dance floor.

                        MICHAEL
           Mi' lady.

                  (to Patrick)
           Good sir.

Patrick rolls his eyes.

INT.   PROM - NIGHT - LATER

Kat and Patrick dance to a slow SONG. Whatever he's
whispering into her ear is making her laugh.

Cam and Bianca dance nearby, glowing with happiness. She
whispers something in his ear and heads for the ladies' room

INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

Bianca walks in, positively radiant. Chastity emerges from a
stall.

                        BIANCA

                  (surprised)
           What are you doing here?

Chastity checks her hair in the mirror,   aloof.

                        CHASTITY
           You think you ' re the only sophomore
           at the prom?

                        BIANCA
           I did.

Chastity maintains her snooty tone.

                        CHASTITY
           And just so you know, my date isn't
           planning on spending most of the night
           in his backseat.

BIANCA What're you talking about?

                        CHASTITY
           Joey Dorsey is only after one thing - -
           your cherry. He practically made a
           public announcement.

Appalled, Bianca storms out. Chastity   tries to backpedal.

                        CHASTITY
                  (continuing)
           I wanted to tell you

INT.   PROM - NIGHT

Joey, drunk, disorderly and pissed off, walks in with a few
stray jocks - also dateless. He zeroes in on Cameron, now
consoling a pissed-off Bianca.

Patrick and Kat continue to slow dance, oblivious to the
evil about to erupt.

                        PATRICK
           My grandmother's .

                        KAT
           What?

                        PATRICK
           That's where I was last year. She'd
           never lived alone -- my grandfather died
           -- I stayed with her. I wasn't in jail,
           I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've
           never slept with a Spice Girl. I spent
           a year sitting next to my grandma on the
           couch watching Wheel of Fortune. End of
           story.

He takes a breath and looks away, not meeting her eyes. Kat
stares at him for a moment and laughs a delighted laugh

                       KAT
          That ' s completely adorable!

                       PATRICK
          It gets worse -- you still have your
          freshman yearbook?

He's interrupted by Joey's hand on his shoulder.

                       JOEY
          What's Bianca doing here with that
          cheese dick? I didn't pay you to let
          some little punk ass snake me.

ACROSS THE ROOM

Michael spots the altercation and dances Mandella over to
Cameron and Bianca.

                       MICHAEL
                 (to Cameron)
          Feces hitting fan. C'mon

Michael takes Cameron aside, leaving Mandella and Bianca
staring after them.

ACROSS THE ROOM

Michael and Cameron approach Joey as he continues to taunt
Patrick who keeps quiet, realizing the weight of this
situation.

                       MICHAEL
                 (continuing)
          Joey, pal, compadre.    Let's take it
          easy.

Joey turns toward Michael and Cameron.

JOEY You two are in big trouble

Cameron faces Joey.

                        CAMERON
          Admit it.   You lost.   Be a man.

Joey PUNCHES Cameron in the face, taking him by surprise
Cameron holds his nose as it bleeds onto his tux

The various cliques descend angrily and Joey is soon
surrounded by seething Cowboys, Coffee Kids and White
Rastas.

                       DEREK
          Very uncool, my brother

                       JOEY
          I'm not your brother, white boy.

The other Rastas GASP, as if stung by the realization that
they're white.

Joey turns back to Patrick and Kat.

                         JOEY
                   (continuing)
            Just so you know -- she'll only spread
            her legs once.

Kat looks from Joey to Patrick, not sure what she's hearing.
Joey pushes through the crowd but a HAND drags him back.
It's Bianca. And she BELTS the hell out of him

                         BIANCA
            That's for making my date bleed

She BELTS him again

                         BIANCA
                   (continuing)
            That's for my sister.

And AGAIN

                         BIANCA
                   (continuing)
            And that's for me.

Cliques now descend on Joey, punching him wildly.

                         COWBOY
            And that's for the fourth grade,
            asshole.

HOTEL - NIGHT

KAT runs down the stairs, Patrick chasing her

                         PATRICK
            Wait I...

                          KAT
            You were paid to take me out! By --
            the one person I truly hate. I knew it
            was a set-up!

                         PATRICK
            It wasn't like that.

                         KAT
            Really? What was it like? A down
            payment now, then a bonus for sleeping
            with me?

                         PATRICK
            I didn't care about the money.

He catches up to her now

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          I cared about --

She turns to face him with a countenance more in sorrow than
in anger.

                       KAT
          You are so not what I thought you were.

He grabs her and kisses her to shut her up. After a second,
she jerks away and flees down the stairs and out of sight.

Bianca stands at the top of the stairs, watching.     She's
never looked more guilty.

INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY

Kat is sprawled on the couch in sweats, wrapped in a
blanket, watching ""Sixteen Candles"". When Molly Ringwald
leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream
date, Kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an
infomercial

The phone sits next to her.    Not ringing.   Bianca breezes
in, bearing a cup of tea.

                       BIANCA
          Are you sure you don't want to come
          with us? It'll be fun.

Kat takes the tea and gives a weak smile.

                         KAT
          I ' m sure .

Bianca sits down next to her

                       BIANCA
          You looked beautiful last night, you
          know.

                         KAT
          So did you

Bianca gives her a squeeze, then jumps up when the DOORBELL
rings, opening the door to a waiting Cameron. He peeks his
head inside.

                         CAMERON
          She okay?

                         BIANCA
          I hope so.

The door shuts behind her as Walter enters.

                       WALTER
          Was that your sister?

                         KAT
          Yeah.    She left with some bikers Big
          ones.    Full of sperm.

                         WALTER
          Funny.

Walter sits down on the arm of the chair and watches the
infomercial with Kat.

                       WALTER
                 (continuing)
          I don't understand the allure of
          dehydrated food. Is this something I
          should be hip to?

                         KAT
          No, Daddy.

                       WALTER
                 (dreading the
                 answer)
          So tell me about this dance. Was it
          fun?

                         KAT
          Parts of it.

                         WALTER
          Which parts?

                       KAT
          The part where Bianca beat the hell out
          of some guy.

                       WALTER
          Bianca did what?

                       KAT
          What's the matter?      Upset that I rubbed
          off on her?

                       WALTER
          No -- impressed.

Kat looks up in surprise.

                       WALTER
                 (continuing)
          You know, fathers don't like to admit
          that their daughters are capable of
          running their own lives. It means we've
          become spectators. Bianca still lets me
          play a few innings. You've had me on
          the bleachers for years. When you go to
          Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to

          watch the game.

                       KAT
                 (hopeful)
          When I go?

                       WALTER
          Oh, Christ. Don't tell me you've
          changed your mind. I already sent 'em a
          check.

Kat reaches over and gives him a hug

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY Kat stands grabs a box of cornflakes
from the food line.

                       CAMERON (0. S.)
          Katarina?

She turns and looks at him

                       CAMERON
          I'd like to express my apologies.

                       KAT
          For what?

                       CAMERON
                 (looking down)
          I didn't mean for you to get -- When
          Bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend,
          I had no idea it would turn out so --
          ugly. I would never have done anything
          to compromise your - - -

He trails off when he realizes she's thrown her food tray
against the wall and marched off -- the old ""kill, kill""
look back in her eyes.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Kat stomps up the hallway, full of menace

CLASSROOM - DAY

Bianca's English teacher perches on the edge of a desk, open
book in hand.

                       TEACHER
          Who can tell me at what point Lucentio
          admits his deception?

The door of the classroom FLIES open and an angry Kat stalks
in, yanking Bianca from her chair and dragging her toward
the hallway.

                       KAT
                 (to the teacher)
          Family emergency.

HALLWAY - DAY

Bianca tries to pull away as Kat drags her by the hair
between two rows of lockers.

                        BIANCA
          Let go!

                       KAT
          You set me up.

                       BIANCA
          I just wanted --

                       KAT
          What? To completely damage me?   To send
          me to therapy forever? What?

                       BIANCA
          No! I just wanted

Miss Perky walks up

                        MISS PERKY
          Ladies?   Shall we take a trip to my
          office?

INT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY

Miss Perky stares at both sisters as they sit before her,
then focuses on Bianca.

                       MISS PERKY
          So you're the real bitch

                       BIANCA
          Yes! Okay? Yes -- I'm the real bitch.
          I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I
          could. Apparently, this makes me a
          horrible person. I'm sorry.

She turns to Kat.

                       BIANCA
                 (continuing)
          I swear -- I didn't know about the
          money. I didn't even know Joey was
          involved. I would never intentionally
          hurt you, Kat.

                       MISS PERKY
                 (to Kat)
          Do you care to respond?

                       KAT
          Am I supposed to feel better? Like,
          right now? Or do I have some time to
          think about it?

                       MISS PERKY
          Just smack her now.

Bianca rises, taking Kat by the arm.

                       BIANCA
                 (to Miss Perky)
          We'll be getting back to you.

                        MISS PERKY
          What, no hug?

HALLWAY - DAY

And Bianca leave Miss Perky's office

                       BIANCA
          Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or
          is it just me?

                       KAT
          It's just you.

ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

Mrs. Blaise faces the class

                       MRS. BLAISE
          All right. I'm assuming everyone found
          time to compose, their poems. Except for
          Mr. Dorsey, who's still in ICU.

Nerds in the back high-five each other.

                       MRS. BLAISE
                 (continuing)
          Would anyone care to read theirs aloud?

No one moves.   Then Kat slowly stands up.

                        KAT
          I'11 go

Patrick looks up.

                        MRS. BLAISE
          Oh, Lord.

She downs a couple Prozac

                       MRS. BLAISE
                 (continuing)
          Please proceed.

Kat stands, puts on her glasses, and takes a deep breath
before reading from her notebook.

                        KAT

          I hate the way you talk to me/ and the
          way you cut your hair/ I hate the way
          you drive my car/ I hate it when you
          stare.

She pauses, then continues

                       KAT
                 (continuing)
          I hate your big dumb combat boots/ and
          the way you read my mind/ I hate you so
          much it makes me sick/ it even makes me
          rhyme.

She takes a deep breath, and looks quickly at Patrick, who
stares at the floor.

                       KAT
                 (continuing)
          I hate the way you're always right/ I
          hate it when you lie/ I hate it when you
          make me laugh/ even worse when you make
          me cry/ I hate it that you're not
          around/ and the fact that you didn't
          call/ But mostly I hate the way I don '
          t hate you/ not even close, not even a
          little bit, not even any at all.

She looks directly at Patrick. He looks back this time.
The look they exchange says everything.

Then she walks out of the room The rest of the class remains
in stunned silence.

EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Kat walks to her car alone. When she opens the door, she's
greeted with a Fender Stratocaster guitar, reclining in the
front seat.

She picks it up slowly, inspecting every detail, then spins
around.

Patrick stands there, smiling.

                       KAT
          A Fender Strat. You bought this?

                       PATRICK
          I thought you could use it. When you
          start your band.

She doesn't answer, but hides a smile, so he walks   closer.

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          Besides, I had some extra cash. Some
          asshole paid me to take out a really
          great girl.

                       KAT
          Is that right?

                       PATRICK
          Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for
          her.

Blushes and looks down.

                       PATRICK
                 (continuing)
          You know -- it's not every day you find
          a girl who'll flash her tits to get you
          out of detention.

Looks up. surprised and embarrassed that he found out

He takes her upturned face as a sign to kiss her and he does
She lets him this time.

Then breaks it off

                       KAT
          You can't just buy me a guitar every
          time you screw up, you know.

He grimaces.

                        PATRICK
          I know

He quiets her with another kiss Which she breaks off again.

                       KAT
          And don't just think you can

He kisses her again, not letting her end it this time.

STRATFORD HOUSE - SUNSET

We hear the sounds of MUSIC and LAUGHTER.

STRATFORD HOUSE/BACKYARD - SUNSET

Patrick is at the barbecue grill, flipping burgers.   Kat
watches.

                       KAT
          Why is my veggie burger the only burnt
          object on this grill?

                       PATRICK
          Because I like to torture you.

                        KAT
          Oh, Bianca?   Can you get me my freshman
          yearbook?

                       PATRICK
          Don ' t you even dare. . .

ON BIANCA AND CAMERON As they argue on the patio.

                         CAMERON
          They do to!

                         BIANCA
          They do not!

Rises to get the yearbook.

                       CAMERON
          Can someone please tell her that
          sunflower seeds come from sunflowers?

ON MICHAEL AND MANDELLA

Severely making-out in a lawn chair.   She comes up for a
breath.

                       MANDELLA
          I can't remember a word of Shakespeare
          right now. Isn't that weird?

Michael pulls her back down for another round ON KAT AND
PATRICK

She tries to keep him from grabbing the yearbook that Bianca
now hands her.

                       KAT
          You're freaked over this, aren't you?

Bianca hands her the yearbook

                       BIANCA
          He's more than freaked.   He's froke

Flips to a page.

                       KAT
          I'd like to call your attention to
          Patrick Verona's stunning bad-ass look
          of 1995 ---

INSERT - A horrifically nerdy freshman year picture Glasses,
bad hair, headgear -- the works.

She holds up the picture for all to view. Patrick cringes
and throws a handful of pretzels at her.

                       BIANCA
          Patrick -- is that- a.

                         KAT
          Perm?

                         PATRICK
            Ask my attorney.

Kat and Bianca huddle over the picture, giggling -- as we
CRANE UP and hear a GIRLY PUNK version of The Partridge
Family's ""I Think I Love You"".

FADE OUT:

    ESTABLISHING SHOT


    EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - MORNING

    We reveal      a nondescript      apartment  complex   in North Hollywood
    California.         It is not    nice or ugly.    It looks  like every
    other    pleasant-looking        apartment  complex  in the valley.


    INT.   APARTMENT - MORNING

    ANDY STITZER, a boyish    looking    forty  year old man, is asleep.
    His clock  radio goes off.      It is playing    oldies, which now
    consists  of rock 'n 1 roll   from the mid eighties.

    MUSIC UP:     ""Heat   Of the     Moment""     by Asia.

    Andy   sits   up in   bed.      Not happy,       not   unhappy,      just    another
    day.


    INT.   LIVING ROOM - MORNING

    Andy is doing his morning     workout.    He is doing bench
    presses.   He lifts   an enormous   amount of weight.     His face is
    very kind,  and vulnerable,    almost  emotionless,   but his body
    is ripped.
    On a book shelf   Andy has         an impressive  array           of    action
    figures  and comic books,          all  in their original              packaging.
    None of his vintage   toys         have been opened.


    EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING              MORNING

    Andy steps   out of his apartment   and unlocks     his                 bicycle.          His
    neighbors,   JOE and SARA, in their   mid-eighties,                     wave to        him
    as he pedals    off.


     EXT. STREET - MORNING

     Andy, dressed   in khaki        slacks    and    a white    dress      shirt,      rides
     his bicycle   to work.


     ESTABLISHING SHOT


     EXT. CIRCUIT CITY - MORNING
     Andy rides    his bike into the parking               loc of a mini-mall.                The
     mini-mall    consists  of a dozen stores              on two stories.

    There     is a Barnes              and Noble   book store,        a Daily  Grill
    restaurant,     a nail              salon,   a children's       gym and a video                store,
    but the centerpiece                   is an enormous      Circuit    City.


    INT.    CIRCUIT          CITY

    Andy walks         inside.     He says   hello      to people    as               he heads
    toward  the        stock   room.    Everyone      politely    says                hello  back        but
    it is clear          he has no close      relationships       here.

    He takes     his         place   at a desk which     is in               an opening  between
    the showroom             and the stock      room.   People               come ·to him with
    their   receipts             to get their     items pulled               from the stock    room
    and delivered              to their   cars.


    INT.    CURCUIT CITY               - LATER

    Andy is stamping                a female    CUSTOMER'S receipt.                   PUNJAB,      an
    Indian salesman,                is standing    nearby.

                                     PUNJAB
                   It has been an honor doing business
                   with    you.       Enjoy   your new
                   television.           Watch River Runs
                   Through       It,   it looks    amazing on
                   this     thing.

                               ANDY
                   Cal will  you please                    help this     woman
                   bring  her stereo    to                 her car.

     CAL, a pudgy            twenty       two   year-old      white     man walks       out   of      the
     stock room.

                                           CAL
                                (not     meaning     it)
                       I'd     love      to.

     He picks     up the customer's                 television         and    walks    with     the
     woman to     her car.


     INT.    CIRCUIT         CITY

     Andy is     walking  across   the showroom     floor,     headed    for the
     bathroom.       He is stopped    by JAY, a tall,       handsome     25 year-old
     salesman,      who is working    a 40 year-old      black    female    customer.

                                  JAY
                    Andy knows all       about  this   stuff.
                    What is the main reason          a flat-
                    screen     is better    than a rear-
                    projection?

                                     ANDY
                    The viewing       angle    is far better   on
                    a flat-screen.          Due to the liquid
                    crystal     display,      you can watch it
                    from any part of the room, and it's
                    a much better        resolution.

                                 JAY
                    So sure,   you'll     save         a couple     bucks
                    with rear-projection,               but you have
                    more than two people               over,   they're
                    gonna have to sit        on        your lap to
                    watch TV.      But maybe           you like     that!

       The woman laughs.
       Andy keeps    walking.          A very     attractive         young     woman steps    in
       his path.     He looks        terrified.

                                     ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                     Could     you   help me?

                                     ANDY
                     No.

                                      ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                     But     you   work here.

                                      ANDY
                     Yes.      I'm   not     a salesman.         I stamp
                     invoices.

                                      ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                     I just   have      a quick question about
                     CD players.

                                      ANDY
                            (quickly)
                     Punjab     or Abujay     will   be happy           to
                     help you.        They're    very nice.             I'm
                     on a bathroom        break.

       DAVID, a young,         shorter      salesman       quickly      runs    up to   the
       woman.

                                         DAVID
                     May I help           you?

            Punjab     walks       over.

                                                     PUNJAB
                             I am Punjab.                I am here            to     serve

                                I was      talking       to    her.

                                                     PUNJAB
                                I am Punjab,            I am here          to       serve
                                you.

            Andy     keeps      walking.             David    and      Punjab            get   into    it.


            INT.     BATHROOM

            Andy     breathes       deeply,           recovering           from          the   interaction       with
            this     pretty       woman.


            INT.     CIRCUIT       CITY       - LATER

            Andy is at his post.       David,                       Jay,      and        Cal   are    a few   feet
            away, having  a conversation.

                                What     about        Andy?

                                                     JAY
                                He doesn't            have    any     money.

                                              DAVID
                                Well,    we can't  play               poker         without
                                at least    four guys.

                                              JAY
                                Al1 right.      But he's    gotta   bring  at
                                least    50 bucks,  or it's      not worth
                                it.
                                      (to Andy)
                                Hey Andy, are you busy tonight?

             Andy    is taken    aback  at the question.                               Although        he's   friendly
             with    them,   they never    invite him out                            to social         engagements-

                                                     ANDY
                                Do we have            to break        down         the     Sony
                                truck?

       No, we 1 re gonna play                poker.            You

                          DAVID
       Well     it's      just    like      that,          except
       with     real      people.

                        ANDY
                (trying   to be hip)
       So,     uh, where's    this   gOing                  down?

                          DAVID

       address.

                         ANDY
       Cool,      very    cool.    Should    I bring
       some      stogies?       Some liquor?

                       DAVID
       Could you stop         off at Boston      Market
       and pick us up some chicken?               Three
       extra     crispy,     one original,      two

       potatoes,       extra   gravy.      Each one
       with    corn on the cob.

                           ANDY
       Okay.

                           DAVID
        I'm     just     fucking     with      you.

                    ANDY

       No.

    us, but he didn't       stop it,  he just
    watched.   It was so gross.       And then
    I couldn't    finish  ...

     Ace two?

                 I am embarrassed to even talk     about

                 She was talking       the whole time.      I
                 was hitting      it big time.     Just
                 hitting    it.     She could barely    walk
                 the next day.        Me so horny.

    They   all laugh,       and     look        at     each         other,      realizing   Andy is
    full   of shit.

                               good ones.

                       JAY
         Give us some details.       Were they
         long nips?      Flat  nips?  Dark
         areolas?      Were they big silver
         dollar   nips?

                               ANDY
         They were             like a dollar.             Like     ten
         dollars.

                               DAVID
         What?

                               CAL

                             ANDY
         Like     ten      times  a night.

                               DAVID
         Ten times.

                         ANDY
         Maybe     twenty.

                               JAY
         Do you         last     a long      time?

                               ANDY
         Oh yeah.

                               CAL
         How long?

                               ANDY
         An hour.
                               DAVID
         Of screwing.

                           ANDY
         Yeah.          Sometimes         a little        less.

                             JAY
         So ten         times   would        take    at    least
          ten    hours.          Do you      rest    in    between?

                               ANDY
         No.      I don't          need    to.

                         ANDY
      Why not.           Why waste        time?

                         CAL
      So sex      with     you    could      take     a whole
      day.

                      ANDY
      Yeah.       More even.

                         DAVID
      Do you      use     protection?

                         ANDY
      Sometimes.           I don't        really      need     to.

                         CAL
      Do you      use     a rubber,         or     a sponge?

                 ANDY
      I always use a sponge.  Sometimes
      two at a time.  What do you guys
      use?

                         ALL
      Sponge.

                         JAY
      Did you      get     a lot      of back        door
      action?

                          DAVID
      Come on,          that's  enough.

                       ANDY
      That's     cool.      We did back door.
      Side door.         We were doing all  the
      doors.
             (joking)
      And a couple        of windows.

                          JAY
      You have          no idea      what    we're      talking
      about.

       He is    pacing          around        furiously.             It     looks      like   he is    talking
       to his    unwrapped             action         figures.

       Andy walks         in,     hoping           nobody         remembers.

       Andy smiles.          They    forgot.           It    is     in     the      past.   Haziz   walks
       up to Andy.

                      Morning,       Haziz.

                      Good     morning,  Debra.

       Andy runs to the stockroom,                     and        closes      the door,      and breathes
       deeply,  almost hyperventilating.                             Jay     walks in.

                                        JAY

                      happen.

       He exits.       Andy     is   white        as   a ghost.
                                                                                                CUT TO:


       EXT. STREET - DAY

       Andy is running          down the street     at                full   speed. We see David
       is chasing  him.          He finally   catches                   up to him on the median
       strip  of Ventura         Blvd.

                                       DAVID
                      Andy,      stop.   Just talk                  to me.
                      You're       gonna get killed                   out here.

        They   sit   on the      center        divider.

                     I don't    need a push.       You ever
                     think   that      some people  find  sex
                     sacred?      It's    not a game.    This                        is
                     a choice.

                                      DAVID
                     To be a virgin.          I'm sorry.                  I
                     didn't     realize    you were so
                     religious.

                                 ANDY
                     Well,  I am.  Okay I'm not.                         But
                     it's  my own personal choice.

                                           DAVID
                     Okay, but             why would     you make             that
                     choice?

        Andy starts    crying,             his   is   mouth    open      in     a silent   scream,         but
        no noise    come out.

                                         DAVID
                     Breathe          Andy, breathe.

                                  ANDY

                              If you're     happy with the way your
                              life   is,  then fine,     but you have to
                              ask yourself,      are you happy?     Don't
                              you ever    wonder    if there's
                              something     more out there?

                              I lead      a pretty full         life.

                              What      am I missing?

                                            DAVID
                              I don't   know.        You're    not just
                              missing   out on sex, you're             missing
                              out on relationships.              How often     do
                              you even leave        your apartment?
                              What about     friends        and love and
                              taking   chances?         And most of all,
                              you're   missing       out on sex.          What
                              are you crazy,         that's    the best
                              thing   on earth.         You can't       live
                              your entire      life     and not experience
                              that.    Hiding      from that      is shutting
                              you down from everything              else.

                                              ANDY
                              You know, we've been working
                              together      for three   years,     and I
                              think    this    is the first     time we've
                              ever    had a conversation        that  lasted
                              longer     than fifteen     seconds.

                                                  DAVID
                               See, good          things are    happening
                               already.

                        pressure.           We'll           just     have    some
                        fun.

                                            ANDY
                         I don't         want to have               sex    with
                         anyone        tonight.

                                              DAVID
                         Don't      worry.         You won't              have    sex
                         with      anyone       tonight.


          EXT.   CITY STREET           - DAY

          Andy is walking   home.    Everything                         he sees  seems            sexual.            It
          is as if he has seen all     of this                         for his entire             life    but
          never  noticed  it before.

          He sees-

          A normal     looking         middle        aged WOMANwalking                   down     the     street.
          He looks     away as         if she        is pure sex.

          A gorgeous      eighteen         year       old        GIRL with        no bra        and     a low       cut   T-
          shirt.
          He turns     away      and    tries        to     hide     at    a newsstand.               He looks
          down.

          QUICK CUTS--every             cover        is     of     a gorgeous,          busty     woman.

          He walks    away and stops     at a bus stop,  just   wanting to get
          home.     The bus pulls    up and on the side    of it is a billboard
          of a perfume     ad with a naked man and a naked woman.         We only
          see their    bodies,    no faces.   It could  not be dirtier.

          Andy panics       and starts       running     down               the street.          As he runs
          the bus pulls        out and is driving           at              the same rate          of speed      as
          Andy.       He can not escape         this   dirty                billboard       no matter       how
          fast    he runs.       Finally     the bus stops                    at the next        light     and he
          loses     it,  but immediately          a new bus                 drives     parallel        to him
          with an even dirtier           billboard       of a               couple,      bodies      naked    and
          intertwined,        clearly    doing      something                 he's    never     done.

          Andy cuts    right and starts    running      through  a neighborhood.
          He cuts   through  houses   and lawns.        He sees two DOGS having
          furious   sex on a lawn.      He cuts    into    the woods and runs and
          runs .

     INT.     ANDY'S APARTMENT

     Andy runs in and closes       the                        door.   He lies  down on his                     bed and
     turns   on the TV.    He channel                          surfs.    Every commercial                      and
     program   has something   filthy                          on it.

     -A soap      opera       with         people       kissing.

     -A commercial             for     Viagra.

      Paris      Hilton        almost         naked          on Entertainment                 Tonight.

     -Teenagers         making         out        on MTV.

     -A dirty    rap video                 with       tons         of barely        dressed       women and a
     ripped   rapper.

     He shuts       the       TV and         closes          his     eyes      as   tightly       as humanly
     possible.

     Suddenly  we hear the sounds      of his elderly   neighbors
     laughing,  then having   very loud sex.       The wall behind                                             Andy
     bangs and shakes.     Then stops.     Then bangs and shakes                                               even
     louder.

     Andy runs         into      the       bathroom.


     INT.     BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
     Andy turns  on the water,    flushes                               the     toilet,        puts      his   fingers
     in his ears and closes    his eyes.

                                              ANDY
                             ( to himself.)
                       Everything's      gonna be ok.
                       Everything     is gonna be ok.


      INT.    BAR - NIGHT

      Jay,    David,      and        Cal     are      talking          to     an overdressed             Andy.

                                       JAY
                       David told me to be sensitive,           so I
                       am going      to be sensitive     with you.
                       It is important        that you lose your
                       virginity,       you are forty    years  old.
                       Enough is enough.          This is a hump
                       you just      need to get over.       Are you
                       ready      to try?

                            ANDY
     David said              I didn't     have       to    have
     sex tonight.

                           JAY
     David          was    wrong.       You do.

                            DAVID
     Come on,             Jay.

                           ANDY
     Tonight?              No.

                     JAY
     Yes, tonight.         What's     the
     difference       between    tonight                  and     any
     other    night?

                            ANDY
     Ok,     I'll         try, but ...

                     CAL
     It's      easy.   Just do what                  I do.
     Only      hit on drunk chicks.

                  ANDY
     I can't   take advantage                   of    someone
     when they're   drunk.

                            CAL
     It's      not        taking    advantage         of     them.
     People          drink so that   they have an
     excuse          to do the things    they really
     want      to     do.

                        DAVID
     That's          why I drink        ... and      smoke
     pot ...

                         ANDY
     I don't          know.   This        doesn't          feel
     right.

                   JAY
     Yes, you do know.      You've got to
     get this   behind you.    And it all
     starts   now.

                                                                        CUT   TO:

        INT.    BAR - LATER

        Andy,     Jay,    David      and         Cal       are     huddled.           Jay     hands     Andy a beer.

                                        JAY
                         Just      walk up to a woman, but if
                         she's      not drunk,   just  move on.
                         It's      not worth   wasting  your time.

        Andy walks        around          the      bar,          scoping      out     women.

        ANGLE ON

        A table      filled        with         pretty,           young      women.

                                       WOMAN#l
                          I just   need to get laid                          tonight.
                          It's   as simple as that.

        Andy walks         up to      the         table.

                                      ANDY
                          Good evening,  ladies.

         The other         woman move             off so Woman #1 can                       talk   to   Andy.   They
         give her        the eye like               ""this is the one.""

                          How are         you doing               tonight?

                     Never better.                 Can I buy you          a few
                     drinks?

                                          WOMAN#l
                     I'm    not really          much of a drinker.
                     But    why don't          you sit down?

                                 ANDY
                     No thanks.     It was nice to                   meet        you
                     though.    Have a good night.

    He walks       away.         She     doesn't     understand           what      just   happened.

                                ANDY
                          (to David)
                     She wasn't  drunk.                Man, this          is
                     gonna be hard.

                     I like        what     I do,     I just      don't        know
                     if managing            a stock room is what I
                     dreamed of            doing when i was in high
                     school.
    We pull out and reveal   that he is talking                                to      a DRUNK WOMAN
    who is passed  out, face down on the bar.

    David    walks     over.

    As Andy walks         away,      he turns        to     the     drunk        woman.

                                      ANDY
                  It was nice           talking           to you.          Have a
                  good night.


    INT.   BAR - LATER

    The guys are hanging        out with eight     drunk                         women, who are
    throwing    their    friend  JILL a bachelorette                             party.   The table
    is littered      with empty glasses    and filthy                            adult  novelty
    items.
    Jay is playing   with            one    of     the    vibrators.              He talks          into    it
    like  it is a phone.

                                 JAY
                   Mr. President.                We have          a situation
                   in the erection               room.

    Everyone  is        laughing hysterically.                      Cal has        edible       underwear
    on his face         and he is eating       through               it.

                                      CAL
                   It    tastes       like chicken.

    They are laughing               so hard,       as only         drunken        people      can      laugh
    at semi-humorous              jokes.

                                       DAVID
                   This guy          will    eat     underwear          that's
                   not even          edible.
    They laugh.       Andy puts            a huge        fake      penis     on his         head,      trying
    to join  in     on the fun.

                                       ANDY
                   Hey,     look at me.              I have        a huge
                   penis      on my head.
    They give him a look               and a little               chuckle,        then      go back         to
    their business.
                                                                                                CUT TO:

INT.   BAR - LATER

It is a little   quieter            now. Everyone     is a little        drunk,
except Andy who holds             the same beer which he has            not taken     a
sip out of.    Andy is          talking   to a pretty    blonde,        NICKY.

                         NICKY
                 (drunk)
            The guy Robin's    marrying,                Jimmy, is
            such a good guy.     I hated                him for
             two years     cause        he cheated          on this
             other  friend     of       mine.    But        he's
             really     changed.         He's    a good       guy
             now.

                               ANDY
             That's     good     that    she's      marrying        a
             good     guy.

                          NICKY
             She deserves     it.          We all     do.      We've
             all been friends            since      we were     six.
             Isn't  that   sick?

                               ANDY
             That's     nice to have good friends
             you've     known for a long time.

                                NICKY
             You have         kind eyes.

                                ANDY
             Thank     you.      You have--

She kisses  him hard on the mouth.   Lots of tongue.                        When it
ends,  Andy looks  like he doesn't know where he is.

                         NICKY
             This is getting   lame.                Let's     get
             out of here.

 Before Andy can say anything,        she            pulls  him up and is walking
 him towards    the exit.     Andy looks             back at his friends,    who
 are so excited     that  they are high              fiving   and giving  him the
 thumbs up.


 EXT. BAR
 ANDY and NICKY are           getting    into    NICKY'S       car.

                      Blow         into        this.

       NICKY holds           up    a rubber         hose      that      is     somehow    attached     to    the
       dashboard.

       ANDY blows    into   the                rubber   tube.        NICKY puts          the   keys   in    the
       ignition   and starts                   the car.

                                               NICKY

                              NICKY
                              me tell    you something.
                         ever be named Dan. Because
                   Dan is a jerk   name.
                                                                                                     26 .




                                       ANDY
                    Okay.

                                 NICKY
                    I am Total    Cereal.  Dan is a bad
                    person   name. Dan rhymes with man
                    and men jerk    off,  and he was a jerk
                    off.   You know what I mean?

                                       ANDY
                    I think      so.

     NICKY'S     driving      becomes        increasingly            erratic.

                                  ANDY
                         (noticeably   uncomfortable)
                    So where do you live?

                                  NICKY
                    Not with jerk-o.     No fuckin'   way,
                    baby.  I did my time.      He's someone
                    else's   problem   now ... Do you think
                    I'm pretty?

     She turns     to ask      the question    and            runs      through        a red    light.
     Two cars     narrowly       avoid a crash.

     ANDY is     quickly      appreciating          the     danger        of    this    situation.

                                     ANDY
                            (reaction   to near             miss)
                     Oh,    God. Yes. Crap.

                                NICKY
                     Look at me. You're   not looking                      at
                     me. Come on. Look at my face.                        Do
                     you think I am pretty?

     NICKY is looking    at ANDY. Her eyes                     don't       even glance          at the
     road.   ANDY'S eyes are glued  to the                     road,       filled  with         abject
     terror.

                                 NICKY
                         (screaming)
                     LOOK AT ME!

                         ( screaming)
                    YOU'RE PRETTY. YOU'RE SO PRETTY.
                    WANT TO LIVE.
                                                                                    I
                                                                                                      27 .




                                 NICKY
                    Thank you. You know if you men
                    would just    offer    up a nice
                    compliment    like   that  every once in
                    a while,   there    would be no poverty.

     ANDY looks      puzzled.

                                       NICKY
                    You're        cute.   Kiss           my mouth.

     ANDY doesn't         move

                                         NICKY
                    Get    over       here.

     NICKY forcefully            pulls        him to       her.

     ANDY is now practically                   sitting          on NICKY'S          lap.   He looks     down
     the road, she looks     at               him.

                                         NICKY
                    I like        you.     You're         not     a jag ...

     She pauses      to    vomit         a little         in     her     mouth.

                                         NICKY
                     ... Off.

     NICKY kisses         him.

                                      ANDY
                    Maybe        I should  drive.

                                  NICKY
                         (playfully)
                    You don't     know where                    I live.

                                         ANDY
                    You could            tell me.

                                          NICKY
                    Hey,     that's         awfully            forward      of    you.

     NICKY begins         tonguing          ANDY'S ear.

                                                                                                                        28.


                                             ANDY
                                   (laughing)
                       That         tickles!

    ANDY is     now      trying             to     help      NICKY steer                the        car.

    She is     giggling       while                tonguing,       he alternates    between
    laughter      and paralyzing                      fear    as the car narrowly       avoids
    striking      pedestrians,                     other     cars,   trees     etc.

    Finally,      NICKY looks                    up.

                                          NICKY
                                (casually)
                       Oh,     this     is me.

    NICKY pulls    the steering    wheel  hard    and the car does        a
    complete    360 and comes screeching        to a halt   between     two
    parked   cars,   in front   of a nondescript     apartment     building.

                                                 NICKY
                       We're         here.

    NICKY looks           deep        into         ANDY's         eyes.

                                  NICKY
                       My Mom's staying                         over       tonight,           so
                       let's just  do it                        here.

    NICKY starts              to     take        off      her     shirt.

                                          ANDY
                       Maybe         I should  be moseying                            home.

    NICKY starts          to cry.                She      then         abruptly         begins            to   laugh.   Then
    she vomits          on ANDY.

                                     NICKY
                       I am so sorry.      I think                          I ate         some
                       bad shellfish     sandwich.

    NICKY continues                  to     take       off       her      clothes         and       kiss       Andy.

                                                 NICKY
                       Hurry up,                 then we can               get
                       breakfast.

    ANDY is      clearly             repulsed             and      traumatized.

                                               ANDY
                        I really             need to            get     going.

     We see     that      NICKY has                vomit         on her          cheek.

                                        NICKY
                   Ok,     fine,        your loss.

                                ANDY
                   I'm just   gonna go,                  I think.  Thank
                   you.  I had a really                   nice time.

                                        NICKY
                   I'll        give     you a lift.

    NICKY puts      the car in drive       and smashes  into    the parked                              car
    three   feet    in front.     The second   car hits   a fire   hydrant                              which
    then blasts       water   through   the open window of a nearby
    apartment.

                                 NICKY
                   Oh my God! I can't        believe     that   I
                   smashed    my neighbor's       car,   and that
                   his car ran over the fire           hydrant,
                   and that    the fire     hydrant    ruined
                   the inside     of that    apartment     ... not
                   again.   You have to switch         places
                   with me.

                                        ANDY
                   What?

                               NICKY
                   If this goes on my record,       I'll
                   lose my licence,      I won't be able                              to
                   get to work,     I'll  lose my job.

    NICKY starts          to    cry    again.

                                        NICKY
                   Please . .. PLEASE l            PLEASE.        . .    Mr.     \\Not
                   Dan Guy. 11

    In the    distance,            we hear      sirens      and         see    the     glow   of   flashing
    lights.

                                        NICKY
                   Just        change     seats      with        me.     Please,
                    ""Not       Dan     Guy. ""

                                        ANDY
                   I don't            want to get         into     trouble.

                             NICKY
                   You won't ""Not Dan, 11 you                      won't.            Do
                   you have a record?

                                          NICKY
                        Then you'll          be fine,   believe     me, I
                        know how this           works.  They'll     act
                        all     serious      and scary,     and then
                        they'll        let you off with a warning.
                                 (beat)
                        And don't         act suspicious,       there's    a
                        gun under your seat.              It's    my ex's.

        They    quickly  switch           seats.       A POLICE OFFICER leans                 his   head
        into    the car.

                                           ANDY
                        Good evening,         Officer.

                                          POLICE OFFICE
                        Everyone        alright  here?

                                    NICKY
                        He was driving   the             car.      He said       he
                        was fine  to drive.
                             (to Andy)

        Off    of   Andy's      shocked      look     we ...
                                                                                              CUT TO:


        INT.    HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

        The cell      is small     and is packed with at least     thirty   hardcore-
        looking     criminals.        We hear them cursing   at each other.       It
        sounds    like     a gang fight     is about to explode.     The camera
        pans across        the faces    and finally  finds  Andy, looking
        terrified       and slightly     bruised.


        INT.    CIRCUIT         CITY - MORNING

        Andy is in        a rage as he complains                  to    David,    Jay   and     Cal--who
        can't  stop       laughing.

                                           ANDY
                         It's     not     funny.

                                           DAVID
                         Tf it wasn't          you,     you     would    admit

                   we didn't             tell  you to switch                 seats
                   with her             when the cops came.

                              DAVID
                   Why did you even let                     her     drive        in
                   the first  place?

                                 ANDY
                   Because    I wasn't     thinking straight.
                   You got me so revved up about
                         (whispers)
                   Having sex
                         (normal    voice)
                   That I didn't      use my brain.

                                   CAL
                       Sounds like   you didn't     use                  anything
                       else.   Did anything     eventful
                       happen?

                       She threw             up on me.

        They explode         with      laughter.

                                   ANDY
                       Keep laughing,  because                    this      is

                     Well I do.       I want to meet a nice
                     girl.    Maybe even someone I

                      want,    then    we are gonna have to
                      make some changes         with you.      Some

       MONTAGEOF ANDY GETTING A MAKEOVER


       INT.   HAIR SALON - DAY

       Andy is getting  a haircut.     When he looks   at his haircut,    it
       is meant to be short    and a little  European,   but the coolness
       of the haircut  makes him look silly.      The guys look at it and
       smile.  Andy looks   happy with it.


       INT.   HAIR WAXING STATION - DAY

       Andy lays on his stomach     on a table.      A WOMANpours    hot wax
       on his back,   lets   it dry for a moment,     then RIPS it off --
       leaving  a huge strip    of whiter-than-white      skin in the middle
       of his hairy   back.

       QUICK CUTS

       *She strips      off     several     more   hunks   of   hair   from   his        back     and
       chest.

       *We see tears  of         pain     coming   down Andy 1 s face.           This     could
       not hurt more.



_..,   *Finally
       about    to
                     Andy 1 red faced
                     pull  off a huge
                                             and miserable,
                                             strip.
                                                                   stops   her      as    she         is

                                                                                                   33.

        He gets up and starts              putting  on his shirt.    Only two thirds
        of his body hair has              been removed,   and he looks   insane.


        INT.   CHESS KING MEN'S STORE - DAY

        Andy comes out of the              dressing     room wearing                 a Eurotrash
        shirt.  The guys like              it.     He is a new man.

        EXT. MINI MALL - DAY

        Jay,   Andy and     David     are     walking       to    get     coffees.

                                       JAY
                    You look         good.
                                          DAVID
                    Better         than    good.        Oddly     good.

                               JAY
                    Now you need to                 learn   how to        talk
                    to women.

                                     ANDY
                     I get     nervous  and I lock                up.       I
                     never     know what to say.

                                JAY
                     The key is, you don't                  say     anything.
                     Make them talk.

                                          ANDY
                     How do you            do that?

                                       JAY
                     Just     ask them questions.                   Girls
                     love     talking.     Let them.
                                        ANDY
                     What     if     they ask        me a question?

                                          JAY
                     Then answer            their      question         with     a
                     question.

                                 DAVID
                     It makes you seem mysterious.                            You
                     talk too much about yourself,                          you
                     look needy.   Put them on the                         spot.

      They walk by Brentano's       book store.  There is                            a pretty        BLONDE
      in her mid-twenties     putting   books on a shelf.

                    Go give        it    a test     run.

      Andy hesitates.          David     pushes      him.      Andy relents.

      INT.   BRENTANO'S           - CONT.

      Andy walks inside    and approaches the                        blonde        woman.       He looks
      at her .badge,  which says BETH on it.

      She turns     and    sees     Andy.         He acts     very     confident.

                                        BETH
                    Can I help           you?

                     I don't       know.   Can you?

      She smiles.

                                      BETH
                    Are    you     looking for         something?
                                       ANDY
                     Is there        something        I should        be
                     looking       for?

      She is     instantly        on the spot.              For the        first     time,      he
      actually      has the       upper hand.

                                        BETH
                     We got a lot of great  new books                          in.
                     It depends  on what you like?

                                ANDY
                     What do you like?

                                        BETH
                     Me?      I don't      know.

                                      ANDY
                     Do you       know?

                                        BETH
                     To tell  you the truth,  I don't      read
                     much.   So I can recommend a book,
                     but I would just be ... bullshitting.

                                          DAVID
                        What?       No.    Are you          serious?

                                   DAVID
                       This has got to be working       for you.
                       Do you feel   the animal   in you
                       coming back to life?     Is the bear
                       waking  up from his hibernation?

     Andy can't  handle                it    anymore.          He takes          the         tape     out   and
     hands  it to Andy.

                                          ANDY
                       I think         you should   go now.                    I am
                       getting         very uncomfortable.

                                    DAVID
                       Don't act like I am the                      weird one.
                       This   is how God created                    us.  To be
                       horny.    You are denying                    his wishes.

                                  ANDY
                       I am not denying                 anything,          I just
                       think you should                 go now.

                                           DAVID

      David      opens          up the      box.          Andy squeals.

                                                 ANDY
                          You are          not     supposed             to    open       that.

      crotch      area.

                          dick falls  off.

                          You did.               Once. What happened?

      Andy closes               the     door     on him.           He paces           around          his     house.

       FLASHBACK
      We see Andy as a TEENAGER. He lays on a bed as a gorgeous
      young GIRL takes her top off and then jumps on him.

       She stops          and         suddenly          looks     disappointed                   and a little
       annoyed.

       David is knocking     on Andy's      door.   The door opens       and Andy is
       standing   there  looking      like  he just   had the greatest       orgasm
       of his life.     His face looks completely         relaxed,    he    walks as
       if he has no energy       left    in his body.

      EXT. ALL STAR SPORTS BAR - PARKING LOT

      Andy, Jay,      Cal and David are walking  from their   cars to the

                    good looking.

                    You meet twenty  girls    in forty five
                    minutes.   It would take you a year
                    to meet that  many women.

                        Ok, eleven   thousand            dollars.

                        Do I think  women should work?                          If
                        they want to.   You don't want                      to
                        work?  Ever?

                         I don't     hit people,   even if they do
                         like   it.     I would feel weird about
                         that.      But I am not judging.

       David     sits    down     at   a table       and   sees     his     ex       girlfriend,   AMY.

                                          DAVID
                    I am just             here to        help       out     a
                    friend.

                                         AMY
                    Bullshit.             You are so gross!                         I am
                    so glad            I broke up with you.

                                          DAVID
                    I'm gross?!             You're          here.           You're
                    gross!

                                          AMY
                    I  am not here to get laid.                                 I   am
                    here to find a nice man.

                    This just             makes me realize                  I made
                    the right             decision.

                              DAVID
                    And I made the right     decision
                    accepting your decision.         Skank.

                                          AMY
                    Pinky         dick.

       The buzzer   goes off.               They        switch  tables.       Suddenly              Amy is
       sitting  across   from             Andy.         She looks    enraged.

                                          ANDY
                               (sensing         danger)
                    Hi 1       I'm     Andy.
                                (beat)
                    I'm        gonna      be quiet         now.

       The buzzer       goes     off      and    they     walk       off.


       EXT. PARKING LOT

       The guys are        walking         to    their      cars,         going      over   their

                    At least    four I think                     would          do me

                                 DAVID
                    That was a good group.       Eleven    had
                    big boobs.      Four had good boobs.
                    And five   had small boobs.      overall,
                    a nice turnout.      What did you
                    think,   Andy?
    Andy can       barely    talk     he is       so flustered               from       this     experience.

                                     DAVID
                    Andy,     are    you okay?

                                    ANDY
                     That    was ... too much.      Too fast.
                     Very    fast.     Didn't  like.    I'm gonna
                     go home.


    INT.    CIRCUIT CITY - DAY

    Jay    walks    over     to Andy.

                                      JAY
                     Come out       to the        floor.

    Andy walks out           on the        floor.  Cal and David                    are        there.    Also
    standing  there          is the        FLOOR MANAGER, PAUL.

                                PAUL
                     Andy, I am short a man today,   so I
                     need you to be a salesman  this
                     afternoon.

                                      ANDY
                     What?         I am not       a salesman.

                                   PAUL
                      Nobody knows the equipment      like
                      you.    I have been thinking    about
                      it,  and I think   your destiny    is on
                      the floor.

     The Indian        salesman,          Aboojay,         walks     over.

                                  ABOOJAY
                      What?!!    We need no salesman.                          I
                      sell.   This is bullshit.

                                          PAUL
                      This    is    not     bullshit.         And I
                      recommend       you      show     some       respect         or
                      you will   be selling     ... something

                                     PAUL
                       What are you talking          about?   You
                       have worked     here    longer    than me.
                       Longer   than   anyone.        It would be
                       fair   if you were my boss.
                                           ANDY
                       Thank     you,       but no thank          you.

                               (gets    annoyed)
                       Andy, I am trying             to get you laid.
                       The guys said         you needed        to get
                       women.        There    is no better       singles
                       bar than       that    floor.      It is a chick
                       magnet.        So accept        my kind
                       invitation        before      I rescind     it.

                                           ANDY
                       Thank      you.

                                           PAUL
                       Enjoy.

        Paul   walks    away.

                                   ANDY
                       Guys.   I appreciate    you doing    this,
                       but I have to admit,     I am really
                       scared.   I am not good at talking
                       with women.     It was hard enough
                       when they were drunk.      And that
                       didn't  even turn    out well.

                                           DAVID
                        Come on.           Fear the       fear    and     do it
                        anyway.

                                             ANDY
                        You are          right.

                                     JAY
                        The floor   is hopping.   Look, we've
                        got a gorgeous   young blonde    at nine
                        o'clock.    A red head at twelve.
                        And a brunette    goth hotty   at three.

                        I don't    care  about   that.  Just

     He sees   the GORGEOUS BLONDE. He walks toward         her                                              with   a look

      INT.   CIRCUIT CITY - ANOTHER HOUR LATER

      Andy is walking         with      the   old    man to        the           stock      room where    Andy
      takes  his ticket.

                                 ANDY
                   This man is getting          a DVD player,
                   VCR, Tivo,     surround      sound speakers
                   and a flat     screen    television    with
                   high definition       capabilities.

                                OLD MAN
                   Thank you, young man.      You are                             the
                   best  salesman   I have ever met.                                You
                   were such a help.

                                     ANDY
                   You 1 re     sure   you don't            need anything
                   else?        Possibly   a car            stereo.

                                        OLD MAN
                   Not today.             But thank         you.         I'll          be
                   back.

      The old man walks          off.      Andy looks relieved.                            Right  then     a
      very pretty forty          five     year old WOMANwalks                            up to him.

                                        WOMAN
                   Excuse       me,     can you      help     me?

      Andy is   flummoxed.

                              ANDY
                   Help?  You?    Uhm.               I was about                  to
                   take my break.

                                       WOMAN
                   It   won't        take long.

                                      ANDY
                   Okay.

~                     Hi,       I'm
                                          TRISH
                                       Trish.
                                                                                                           52.




                                             ANDY
                       Andy ...       is    my name.
                                                                                                    CUT TO:


        INT.   CIRCUIT      CITY       - LATER

        Andy   is   nervously          helping           Trish.

                                             ANDY
                       You don't             want       this      VCR.

                                             TRISH
                       Really?              I heard        this      was    the   best
                       one.

                                             ANDY
                       It's  not,    really.       VCR technology
                       is very    simple.      Basically,     no VCR
                       is that    much better        than another
                       VCR. The expensive            ones don't    give
                       you a better       picture,       they just
                       look cooler,        and have more buttons
                       which you would never use.

        Andy points         out   a standard               looking         VCR.

                                             ANDY
                        This    one has the features           you need
                        and it is a third          less   than     the
                        cool-looking       one.      Unless    you
                        really     want a cool-looking          one.
                        Then you should         get this     one.
                         'Cause    it does    look cool.         It's
                        black.       Has a lot of lights.

                                             TRISH
                        Looks         are    not a factor.

                                              ANDY
                        Great.             Then we have             found     what    you
                        need.

         The old     man that         Andy        was     helping        previously         walks   over    to
         Andy.

                                              OLD MAN
                         Excuse me.               Is there          anyone who can

_...,                    help  me set             up what          I bought?

                                                                                     53.
                                 OLD MAN(cont'd)
                     I am not very technically                    minded.
                     And quite  frankly,   I can                 barely   see
                     my own hand.

                                      ANDY
                     Where       do you live?

                                          OLD MAN
                      Right      down      the street         on Moorepark.

                                 ANDY
                      I can swing by on my way home                        from
                      work and set it all up if you                        like.

                                       OLD MAN
                      How much        would that         cost    me?

                                      ANDY
                      Nothing.        It would          be my pleasure.
                      I would      enjoy  it.

                                          OLD MAN
                      That's      very      kind of      you.

                                      ANDY
                      You're     doing  me the favor.                  I like
                      hooking      up TVs and stereos.                  It's
                      like    solving   a big puzzle.

                                 OLD Ml\N
                      Thank you.    Maybe I could                  bring      in
                      something  for you to eat.

                                          l\NDY
                      And maybe I will     gladly                 eat it.
                      Just  give your address                   to the man
                      at the stock   room.

         The old man walks     off.    Trish    looks   at Andy.      Andy looks       at
         Trish.   She stares     at him for a moment,        trying    to figure       him
         out.   She likes    something    about    him.   l\s she   figures    out     what
         to do about    it,  Andy gets    nervous.

                                          ANDY
                      Well,      have      a good      day.

                                          TRISH
                      Andy.       It's      Andy,      right?

                                          ANDY
                      Last     time       I checked.
                               (nervous       laugh)

                                        to go out         some   time?
                                                                         54.




                                  ANDY
                          (swallows)
                    Excuse   me?

                                      TRISH
                    I don't         mean to be        forward.     I'm
                    sorry.

                                      ANDY
                    No.      Don't     be sorry.

                                       TRISH
                    I just    ...    I don't   know, I thought   it
                    might     be     fun.    You seem like  a good
                    guy.
                               ANDY
                    I would love to.     That seems like
                    something  I would like,    and ... yeah.
                    In fact,  I was just   about to ask
                    you.

                                       TRISH
                    I beat      you     to it.

                                       ANDY
                         (nervous             laughter)
                    Yes you did.

                               TRISH
                    Great.  This'll  be fun. And don't
                    worry,  I'm not going to ask you to
                    set up my VCR.

                                       ANDY
                    I would         do it.

                                TRISH
                    I was joking.

                                     ANDY
                    Oh.        Okay.
                              (not getting  it)
                    But      I would do it.

     They   smile    at   each       other.

                                                                                        55.



    INT.   CIRCUIT        CITY

    Andy is    telling         David      and    Jay     what     happened.

                                        DAVID
                   See,        I told    you this           was   the     move.

                                        JAY
                   Who's        the     girl?

    Andy points          to   Trish      who is        paying     for     her    VCR.

                             JAY
                   Her.  Oh man, you  hit the jackpot.
                   She is a waitress  next store.     I
                   went out with her two years    ago 1
                   and she is ready to go.

                                        ANDY
                   Now I don't            want     to     go out        with
                   her.

                                        JAY
                   I didn't           do anything.              We just         had
                   one kiss.

                                         ANDY
                   Oh,        okay.
    When Andy looks             the other   way Jay gestures     with his hips           that
    he had sex with             Trish.    When Andy turns    back he stops.

                                        JAY
                   Good for           you, man.           This     is    good.


    INT.   RESTAURANT - NIGHT

    Andy and      Trish        are    eating      dinner.

                               TRISH
                    That's  so funny that we work in the
                    same mini mall and we have never
                    seen each other.

                                         ANDY
                    I've   seen          you.     I eat at the
                    restaurant            you    work at on Monday's.

                                         TRISH
                    Really?             Every    Monday?

                                    ANDY
                        Yeah.    I would eat                     there  more,              I
                        just  don't  want to                     get sick   of             it.

                                               TRISH
                        Have         I ever      waited          on you?

                                           ANDY
                        Maybe         a couple  of          times.

        It   is   clearly          way more       than     a couple                of    times.

                                                TRISH
                            How long          have you      worked            at    Circuit
                            City?

                                               ANDY
                        Nine         years.

                                           TRISH
                        Wow.          Do you like           it?

                                               ANDY
                            Not    really.       But      it's         a good           job.

                                               TRISH
                            What     would      you like          to    be doing?

                                          ANDY
                            I have a collection      of antique
                            toys.      I would like    to open a
                            store   that   sells those    kinds of
                            things.      Maybe some comic books.
                            I don't    know if I'll    ever be able
                            to do it.

                                               TRISH
                            Sure you          will.  You could                 do
                            anything.

                                               ANDY
                            That's     nice      of you          to    say.         What
                            about     you?

                                         TRISH
                            I want to work at that      restaurant
                            for the rest    of my life.      I have no
                            goals   or dreams.   They've     all been
                            drained   out of me.

                                               ANDY
                            That's      not     true .

                                  TRISH
                     I just   want to be happy.        I don't
                     care what I do, I just      don't    want
                     it to be too hard.      Less hours.       I
                     guess   what I am saying    is I want to
                     retire.

Andy     laughs.

                                   TRISH
                          (sweetly)
                     What is with you?

                                       ANDY
                     What?

                                     TRISH
                     There      is something        about      you.       I
                     can't      tell  what it       is.

                                       ANDY
                     Is   it    bad?

                                   TRISH
                     I think  it's    good.          But      I don't
                     know.   Are you for            real?

                                       ANDY
                     I'm real.

                                       TRISH
                     Good.
                                                                                        CUT TO:


INT.     TRISH'S          APARTMENT - DAY

Andy and         Trish         walk    in the    apartment.

                                       TRISH
                     Can I get         you a cocktail?

                                      ANDY
                     Sure.      Do you have orange        soda?
                     It's   okay if you don't.          Most
                     people     don't     buy orange   soda on a
                     regular      basis.       I don't know why.
                     It's    really      good.

Out     of    t.he    blue,      she    kisses    him   hard     on     the   mouth.        The    kiso
lasts        a long time.    At first  he doesn't      know what                       to    do,    but
after        about  ten seconds,   he actually    participates.

                                                                                                   58.

    When she    stops         kissing           and looks       at him, he could         not be
    redder.     He is         stunned,           but there        is happiness in        there.

                                     TRISH
                     Let's      go in the other                room.


    INT.   BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
    Trish   jumps under               the covers.   She pulls                 off her shirt   then
    reaches    under the              sheets  and removes  her                pants  and underwear.

                                          TRISH
                     Come on.

                                          ANDY
                     Oh.       Okay.
    Andy gets under  the covers   with all his clothes     on and kisses
    Trish,  who is now completely    nude. He seems to be getting
    the hang of it.    There  is a lot of pent-up   energy   there.

                                          TRISH
                     Wow, you           really  like          kissing.

                                              ANDY
                     I do.
                                          TRISH
                     Take       off     your clothes.

                                              ANDY
                     Really?
                                              TRISH
                      Is     this      too      fast?       I never      do this.

                                              ANDY
                      No.
     Andy takes   his pants  off,                       but strangely,         leaves   on his    shirt.
     Probably   to cover his bad                        wax job.
     Trish  shuts   the             lights.          They    kiss     passionately.       she    takes
     off his shirt.

                                              TRISH
                      Do you have               protection?

                                              ANDY
                      I don't           like      guns.

     She   laughs.

                                    TRISH
                      You have a silly       sense
                                        I think
                                                     of humor.
                                                   I have
                                                                                                              59.




                      something.

     She rea.ches     into   the drawer   in the end table    and pulls out a
     small    whicker    basket   filled  with condoms.    She clearly  has
     sex often     enough    to need this    basket.   Andy does not pick up
     on this.

                                                 TRISH
                      Put     one      of         these   on.

     Andy st.ares    at the             basket,     not sure what to do.      He has never
     worn a condom.       He            slowly    takes  one out.     He reaches   under
     the sheets,     and we             can 1 t see what he is doing but it is
     obvious    that   he is            tearing     the wrapper   open and attempting    to
     put the condom on.

     Something        goes     wrong.               He struggles.

                                             ANDY
                      It     tore.           I need       another        one.

     He grabs  another   one.   The same                            thing       happens.   For reasons
     which are not clear,     he can not                            figure       out how to get this
     condom on properly.

     Andy attempts    this     many more times.     In quick cuts    we see him
     struggle    with at least      a dozen condoms   as he gets    more and
     more frustrated      with   this  process.   Each time he fails,      he
     tosses   the condom and the wrapper        on the floor   next   to him.

     Finally     he    gets      one         on.

                                                 ANDY
                      There    you go.        Sorry    about   that.                         I
                      always     have trouble         with those
                      things.        I haven't      used 'em much.
                             (beat)
                      My last      girlfriend       took pills.

                                                 TRISH
                      I'm      sure         it     will   be worth           the     wait.

     Now they     go at         it     more         passionately.               It    seems      like   it   is
     going  to    happen             when-

     THE DOOR OPENS - THE LIGHTS GO ON

                                          MARLA
                      What is          going on in here?!

•Lr-   We reveal  Trish's sixteen

       ANGLE ON
       A stack       of    condoms              and     torn     wrappers.

       ANGLE ON MARLA - STARING AT THEM

                          unfair!!!

       She   slams        the    door           and     exits.

                          No,      it's         okay.          I just   need   to   talk
                          to     her.
                                           ANDY
                          No,      I should.

       He kisses   her then quickly      gets out                            of bed and begins   putting
       his clothes    on.    We see his insanely                              bad wax job has left
       random strips      of hair  on his body.                              He puts his clothes    on
       and exits.

                                                  TRISH
                           I'm     sorry.

                                                  ANDY
                           Don't          be.

        He runs       out.         Traumatized                 again.


        EXT. STREET - DAY

        Andy rides    his bike to work.   He looks confused     and                                 consumed.
        Everywhere    he looks he sees sexual   images; billboards,                                     people
        walking    down the street,  etc.
        He drives         into the parking                       lot   of the mini mall where   Circuit



...     City is
        the girl
                      located.    As he is
                        from the bookstore,
                                                                 locking
                                                                    walking
                                                                            his bike,  he sees Beth,
                                                                               from her car to work.

\..,                             BETH
                     Good morning.
                                                                                                            61.




       Andy    thinks.     He remembers                  what     he    is   supposed        to   do with
       her.      Ask questions.

                                     ANDY
                              (after  a beat)
                      Is    it a good morning?

                                            BETH
                      I hope        it     is.

                                           ANDY
                      Hmmm.

                                               BETH
                      Some      days       I am just            not     in   the     mood
                      to    work.

                                            ANDY
                      What        are     you in the            mood to        do?

                                       BETH
                              ( f 1 ummoxed)
                      Oh,    I don' t know ...

                                               ANDY
                      You don't                know?     Or do you           know?

       She thinks      he    is     being        sexy,      but       he has       no idea    what    he    is
       saying.

                                               BETH
                      You're            bad.

                                            ANDY
                      Are    you         bad?

        Andy walks   off.           She looks    like    she is about   to have                       an
        orgasm.    As she          walks  toward     the bookstore    where she                       works
        she almost   trips.


        INT.    CIRCUIT     CITY - DAY

        Andy is selling            a stereo    to an UNATTRACTIVE MAN. There                                are
        pretty   girls     in      the store,    but Andy has let the other
        salesmen     handle        them.    Jay walks over to Andy.

                                               JAY
                       Don't  worry              about     what        happened
                       last  night.

                                              ANDY
                    I think             so.

                                JAY

    Jay    walks   off.


    EXT. HOLIDAY INN - NIGHT

    Andy rides          his      bike         up to        the   front      of    the     hotel.


    INT.    HOLIDAY INN HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

    Andy walks  down the hallway   looking                                   for the room.             When he
    finds it,  the door is cracked    open.                                   He enters.


    INT.    HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

    Andy looks          around          the     suite.           There       is   nobody       in   sight.

                                              ANDY
                    Hello.

                                               ANDY

        Andy sits
                      Come sit

                      on the couch.
                                               BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                                             down.

                                                       She sits down right                 next    to   him.
                                                                                                               63.




        Andy does     not know what                  to make of this.

                                               ANDY
                      So where               do you know          Jay     from?

                                           BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                      We just           met the other night.
                      You're           handsome.

                                                 ANDY
                      Thank           you.         You're      pretty.

        She   puts   her     hand          on his      knee.

                                            ANDY
                       What's          going  on?

                                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                       The     party             is getting started.

                                                 ANDY
                       Nobody          else        is coming?

                                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                       I'm      all        the     party you need.

                                                 ANDY
                       Oh my God.

                                        BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                       Don't       be nervous.   I'll take                          good
                       care       of you.

                                               ANDY
                       Are      you        a ... prostitute?

                                     BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                       I'm whoever      you want me to be.       I
                       can be a prostitute,        or I can be
                       that   sweet   innocent   girl    you had a
                       crush on in high school.          You know,
                       the cute one who never         looked  at
                       you but now she realizes          she made a
                       mistake    and wants to make up for it
                       by sucking     your cock.

        Andy backs         away       to     the    other      side      of   the     couch.      She   follows
        him .

                                Did Jay     do this?
                                                                                 64.




                                    BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                   They're     good friends.            They just
                   want you to have a good time.
                   Don't    worry,      I've    been with virgins
                   before.       It's     okay that      you know
                   nothing,     because        at the end of
                   tonight     you are going          to know
                   everything.          You're     gonna do
                   everything.          Nothing     is off limits.
                   They paid       extra     for that.

                                  ANDY
                   How much     are they     paying    you?

                                    BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                   Five   hundred      for two hours.

                                  ANDY
                   I will   give you six hundred        dollars
                   to leave     now.     Or we can find
                   someone    else    that  you can have sex
                   with.    I'm sure we can find someone
                   to use that       credit  on.

                                BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                   You don't   have to have sex with me.
                   I've   been paid.   If you want I can
                   just   go home now.   No skin off my
                   apple.

                                  ANDY
                          (feels    bad)
                   No, no, no.          I'm sorry.     I've
                   insulted      you.      Maybe I'll    want to

        Both sides!       She was screaming.
        She was like,       ""I want to have                     more

        It was so ... perfectly    in

        her panties   ... they were all  filled
        with baby powder and--

        Oh Goddammitt!                 Nothing        happened!

        Buying a streetwalker        is not

            She sees the guys arguing,                             but does not hear the words.    From
            her point  of view it looks                            like Andy is bossing  them around,

                           good person.       And I would rather
                           treat    people   well than stick    my
                           wiener     in 'em.    And I say that
                           proudly.       And if you don't   like  it,
                           then         I'll         get      some        new friends.
                           That is              if     I ever            really       was your
                           friend.

                    don't   mind me calling     you.     Your
                    friends    at work gave me your
                    number.      I feel bad about what
                    happened     the other  night    and
                    wondered     if you would let me make

                              Six,     twelve         and ... twenty         six.

                                                  ANDY
                              That's         three.

                                                    TRISH
                              Oh.       Is    it?

        They        laugh.

                                         ANDY
                              You must have been                  really  young why
                              you had the twenty                  six year old.

                                                    TRISH
                              Why do you             say that?

                                                 ANDY
                              Because         you are so young               now.

                                                    TRISH
                              Are you           full   of shit      or    is        this
                              real?

                                        ANDY
                              Why do you keep saying                     that?

                                            TRISH
                                    (kind of kidding)
                              Because    if you're   for real, I'm
                              gonna fall     in love with you.

        Andy blushes.

                                                    TRISH
                               I'm     sorry.        I'm just      goofing           with
                              you.

                                                    ANDY
                               I know.

        It     is     clear      she     is      not   goofing.

•L-                     more, that
                                    TRISH
                        I was thinking,    if we go out
                                     we shouldn't  have
                                                                                  any
                                                                                  sex.
                                                                                                       70.




                                            ANDY
                        Uh-huh.

                                         TRISH
                        I just      think   it complicates                    things
                        too much, and then you never  get                                to
                        really know someone because  that                                is
                        always      confusing            things.

                                            ANDY
                        It's     very       confusing.

                                         TRISH
                        Does     that    bother          you?

                                       ANDY
                        Hmmm. Let me think    about                       that.     I
                        see what you are saying.                          Obviously
                        I want to
                               (whispers)
                        Do it.
                               (normal voice)
                        But I can see your point.                            If    we
                        don't have sex,  we can                     really         get
                        to know each other.

                                            TRISH
                        And if       that      works      out,      then      we can
                        have      sex.       Like      really       have      sex.

        They   laugh.

                                            ANDY
                        Just      tons      and tons        of     sex.

        They both laugh.    Andy could                      not     be more          relieved   to   have    the
        pressure  taken  away.

                                        TRISH
                                (charmed)
                         You're     doing it again.

                                            ANDY
                         What?

         INT.    TRISH'S          APARTMENT - LATER

         Andy and Trish    are watching    television.                          Her daughter,    Marla,
         comes inside   with Trish's    six year-old                         daughter   JULIA.

                                              MARLA
                               {covers           eyes)
                         Is it safe            to come   in   or     are     you
                         doing   it?

                                              TRISH
                           It's      safe.     Marla,    Julia.            This    is
                           Andy.

                                              MARLA
                                    (uninterested)
                           Hello.

         Julia    nods      shyly.

                                              ANDY
                           Hi.

                                        MARLA
                           We came home because   we got bored
                           and couldn't   think of anything  else
                           to do.

                                       JULIA
                           Can we watch   TV?

                                           TRISH
                           No.     You 1 ve watched    enough
                           television       for today.     Why don't
                           you guys read?

                                       !""ARLA
                           I am so sick   of reading.     That's
                           all we do all   day at school.

                                      ANDY
                           Hey.  Let me show you              something.
                           Do you have a quarter?

         Marla  digs         out a quarter.  Andy             puts         it in his palm    and    shows
         the two of          them.  Then he closes             his         palm and opens    it.      It
         is gone.

                                              MARLA
                           You 1 re     not    doing magic,        are      you?

                                       JULIA
                    I love         magic.    Where                  did     it     go?

     Andy puts  his hands      out again,    opens them and it is back.
     Then he puts     it in one palm,     closes     it, and it is two
     quarters.    Julia    squeals  with    delight.

                                       JULIA
                    How did         you do that?

                                          ANDY
                    I don't          know,        it    1
                                                            s,     uh ... magic.

     Andy closes    his hand,  opens    it and they are                                   gone,  then opens
     the other   hand and there     are three    quarters.                                   Then he closes
     his hands,   opens  them,  and the quarters         are                              gone but the
     other  hand has a dollar     bill    in it.

                                        JULIA
                    That's         crazy.     How did                     you     learn
                    how to         do that?

                                          ANDY
                        I have     a lot     of         free        time.

     Trish    smiles.            He is    great             with     her        kids.

                                        JULIA
                        Can you      show me how to                       do it?

                                          ANDY
                    The magicians    code says I am not
                    allowed    to say how tricks are
                    performed.

     Julia    frowns.

                                          ANDY
                        But who cares     about magicians?
                        They're   creepy   anyway.   If they get
                        mad, I'll    punch them in the nose.

     Julia    laughs   and         Andy starts      showing                      her how to   do the   trick.
     Marla    c_an' t help         but like    him.     Trish                     beams.


      EXT.   TRISH'S       APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Andy   is   saying         goodnight             to    Marla.

          Andy leans          in, and for              the first   time in the              film,  he is        the
          instigator          of a kiss.               It is short    but sweet             and heartfelt.

                      So?

                      At     least      we know             she's      had     sex.

                      At     least      three         times.

     They    laugh.

                      I don't          care.   I like                 her.

                      I don't          know.        I want to see what
                      happens   with             Trish.    I am only one
                      man.    I can't             go out with everyone.

                                  DAVID
                      I love this  guy. He's                              already      got
                      more women than he can                              handle.

                                           JAY
                      I don't          mean      to     ruin        this      for     you,
                      but I had           sex        with      her.          On a first
                      date.

     Andy stares            angrily       at     him.

                                           ANDY
                      So? What is            that    supposed                 to make
                      me not like            her--because                    she made
                      one terrible             mistake?

     David     and    Cal      crack      up.

                                           CAL
                       Ooooh!           Andy is         burning            you.

     The store        manager,           Paul,        walks         over.

                                            PAUL
                       Andy,          I just  got           back       the     numbers

                       what you want.      Next time you won't

                       It's      so unfair.

        though  there    are tears    pouring    out of his eyes.

                        I just         think    that     we should   be

                        because          they are       clearly   of a
                        higher         quality.

        Cal realizes          something         is     wrong     and exits.

                        why people       kill  themselves. I
                        really     understand.

       Can you take Marla to Planned
       Parenthood?    She wants to go on the
       pill.

                     ANDY
       Me?

                    TRISH
       Her father    is dead set against        it.
       I am too.     But I thought     maybe you
       could  bring    her down there    just     to
       get some information.       Maybe we
       could  delay    her for a little     bit
       while   we figure   out what to do.

                     ANDY
       Isn't   she   a little        young   to   go on
       the pill?

                       TRISH
       She's    sixteen.      And she won't
       listen     to me.     I told   her she
       should     wait till    she's   much older
       to have sex, but it's          hard for me
       to say that       when I had a kid at
       seventeen.        So I thought     maybe she
       would listen       to you.

       I don't     know if I am the          right
       person    to do this.

       Yes you are.    She has no issues
       with you.    She likes you.    Gosh,
       this was so much easier     when we
       were young.

                        ANDY
       Yeah.

                   TRISH
       When we were kids,      you just    did it.
       It was fun.     It was no big deal.
       There weren't     all these   horrible
       diseases.     Now the whole thing      is
       terrifying.

                                TRISH

              me if      you did this.      I wouldn't
              forget       it.

              Won't       she     be uncomfortable?

              No.

               uncomfortable.

                   I don't          mean it to            be gross.      Your
                   mother         thought    you          needed    someone
                   to talk          to.

                                MARLA
                   Andy, you're   a nice     guy, but you're
                   practically   a stranger.      I don't
                   want to talk   about    sex with you.

                                    ANDY
                    Either     do I.     I know it's
                    embarrassing,        but you need to
                    inform     yourself.        I think    that    is
                    very    important     before     you make a
                    life-changing        decision.        'Cause
                    once you have sex,           there   is no
                    turning      back.    You will      never    be
                    the same again,         and what if you
                    want to go back?           But you can't.
                    There     are no time machines.             The
                    pandora's       box will     be open.

                                   MARLA
                    Okay,     I get it.      Stop trying                  to
                    freak     me out.   I'll     listen.

        INT.   PLANNED PARENTHOOD - DAY

        Andy and   Marla    sit      across       from      JUDITH,       a counselor.

                                    JUDITH
                    Coming here was a very smart            thing
                    to do.      A lot of young people         act
                    without     thinking.      Carefully
                    considering       your options      is a very
                    responsible       way to act.       You should
                    be proud      of yourself.

                               MARLA
                    Would it be weird   if I just                      asked
                    you for the pill  right  now?

                                         JUDITH
                    A sense         of    humor      is    an effective
                    weapon        in high school.                I'm   sure     it

                                  that

                  young age.

                                      JUDITH
                   That's       true.     Your virginity               is a
                   gift.        A gift    you shouldn't               be so
                   quick      to give     away.

                                       ANDY
                   I completely           agree.

                               JUDITH
                   There  are plenty   of activities                       you
                   can engage   in without   having                     sex
                   that  can be fun and safe.

                                     ANDY
                          ( interested)
                   What kind of activities?           I'm                   sure
                   she 1 s interested     in knowing.

                                   JUDITH
                   Well,    instead    of having
                   intercourse,       you might               want     to    try
                   outercourse.

                                       MARLA
                   Outercurse.           Uch.            What's     that?

                                    ANDY
                   Yeah,      what's   that?

        Andy is leaning       forward       in     his     chair,     way more     interested
        than Marla.

                                    JUDITH
                    Outercourse        is anything   that isn't
                    vaginal      intercourse.      It can be
                    just     having    fun in a non-sexual      way
                    with your friend.          Or it can be
                    kissing.

                                        ANDY
                    Kissing       is     nice.

                                  JUDITH
                    And there     are many ways to be
                    sexual    without  intercourse  - such


 ...                as body rubbing,
                    call   ""dry humping.""
                                          which you might




•

•...     See,     you
                           ANDY
                         can do that.

                            JUDITH
                                                                    85 .




         Masturbation,          mutual      masturbation.

                            ANDY
         What's     that?

                     JUDITH
         That's  when you both              masturbate         at
         the same time.

                    ANDY
              (to Marla)
         You could  do that             instead.

                            JUDITH
         There's        deep   kissing,    erotic
         massage,         oral   sex play,     role-
         playing,         and sharing     fantasies         with
         a partner.

                     ANDY
         So there  are a lot of things                   you
         can do instead   of sex.

                             JUDITH
         It's   only        limited     by your
         imagination.

                               MARLA
         I think         I'm    gonna   vomit.

                         JUDITH
         That's     very funny,     but this    is
         serious     business.      Outercourse
         offers     nearly     100 percent
         protection        against  pregnancy.

                            ANDY
         That's         a plus.  I didn't          know that.

                        JUDITH
         Outercourse       can also greatly       reduce
         the risk     of HIV/AIDS and many other
         sexually     transmitted     infections      -
         unless    body fluids     are exchanged
         through     oral   or anal intercourse.
         But some infections,         like    herpes
         and HPV, can be passed          by skin-to-
         skin contact.

                      This is fantastic.         What would
                      someone do about performance
                      anxiety?      'Cause    I am sure Marla
                      and her friend       are worried       that
                      their    sex won't    be satisfying,        and
                      then the unsatisfied        partner       might
                      fly into     a rage and break        it off
                      with the inadequate        partner.

                                        JUDITH
                       Sex takes       practice,       but there     are
                       many techniques            to extend      the
                       amount of time that             a man can

                       visualization           techniques      and a

       Andy   is   talking         to    Trish.

                      I don't  know what you                    did,         but she
                      has completely     changed                 her         tune.

                                   ANDY
                      It wasn't    really  me.   She is a
                      smart  kid.     Once she got all  the
                      right  information,     she knew what                                to
                      do.

                        I know so.           I've      seen     it.

                      been a long day.

       He giggles        nervously            at   his   own joke            and      exits         before      she     can

                     You could      go that  way, but                         for     the
                     extra    money you are getting                             a
                     product     that  will  be the

                     Well,  don't   decide   today.   As I
                     always  say, there    is nothing   wrong
                     with delaying     an important

        He walks    to     the     register.             Trish        walks     over          to    him.

                         I knew you were working        a long
                         shift   today,    so I brought   you a

                       What is         outercourse?

                       Mutual masturbation.            Rubbing on
                       each other         with our clothes    on.
                       Fooling      around     without  exchanging
                       fluids.        It's    fun and it's
                       responsible.

                        about?  Are you high?

            I knew there           was     something              about
            you.   You're          too     mellow.               Are you
            on oxycotin?

            No!

                        TRISH
            Do you think    I'm unattractive?
            Old?   What the hell's     the matter
            with me?    What the hell's       the
            matter  with you?

                                ANDY
            Nothing.            We had     an   agreement.

                                TRISH
            Not     forever.

                                 ANDY
            Well you           can't    just    break            the
            agreement           without      talking             to me
            about   it.

                                TRISH
             I am talking          to you       about            it     now.

                          ANDY
            Well     I am saying           I want           to        think
            about     it.

                           TRISH

                            TRISH
             Because      I am in love               with        you.

She waits     for him to reply            in kind,   but he is stunned.           He is
mainly   thinking     ""if I say          I love her,    which I do, she        will
want to.have      sex with me.            What to do?""

                            ANDY
         You can't          put that    kind       of pressure
         on someone.

                            TRISH
         If   you    love     someone, there    is              no
         pressure.           I knew I shouldn't                 have
         said that.

                            ANDY
         That's      not      true.

                             TRISH
         Wow, you          still   haven't      said      it.

                    ANDY
         What is going on?               Where      is    this
         coming from?

                             TRISH
         You fucker.            Don't    play      head     games
         with     me.

                             ANDY
         What?        I'm     not playing.

                      TRISH
          You are not just    playing     with me.
          I am part   of a family.      If that
          sucks,  tough shit,    that's    just how
          it is.

                             ANDY
          Who's      complaining?

          Get out.           Just get    out.       You liar.

          I didn't          lie.

                      TRISH
          Yes you did.    You're             not    who you
          said      you     were.

                      You said you were the one.
                      one would have passion
                      would want me.
                                                for me.
                                        Would love me.
                                                       But the

                      wouldn't  always be moving away just
                      a little  when I touched    him.    It's
                      cruel.   So, just  get out!

        Andy is   pushed      out    the    door.


        INT.   ANDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Andy enters     his    apartment.            Jay     is   there   packing   up his
        things ..
                                  ANDY
                      What happened?

                                          JAY
                      Me and Jill           are getting    back
                      together.            She's pregnant.

                                          ANDY
                      With    your        kid?

                                   JAY
                      Yeah, with my kid.       That's    why she
                      broke up with me.       Because    she
                      found out she was pregnant,          and she
                      didn't  know if I would be a good
                      dad in light    of the fact     that    I
                      cheat  on her all    the time.

                                          ANDY
                      so this        is    good?

                                    JAY
                      It's   the best.     I love her sooo
                      much.     This was meant to happen.    I
                      was meant to be with her and to be
                      the father     to this   child. I will
                      never screw around again.       I am so
                      lucky.

                           (sadly)
                       I am so happy for              you.

~   I'm sorry.
                 ANDY

    your good news.
    \cause  Trish
                   I don't  mean to ruin
                         I'm just  sad
                    wants to have sex.
                                                               95 .




                          JAY
    That's         what     you   wanted.

                ANDY
    No, she really    wants to have sex.
    Like right   now.    What do I do?   If
    she finds   out I am a virgin   she
    won't  like  me anymore.    She will
    think  I am a loser.

                      JAY
    No,      she    won't.

                    ANDY
    She will.        What kind of man doesn't
    have sex for forty          years?    And I am
    about  to turn       forty    one.   If I turn
    forty  one without         having  sex,
    that's    really    pathetic.

                          JAY
    Then don't             tell   her.      Just  have   sex
    with her.              Give   it to     her really
    good.

                       ANDY
    I don't         know how to        do that.

                      JAY
    You might         get lucky.            You might    be
    good.

                          ANDY
    Really?

                  JAY
    Well ... since     you         have forty  years
    of sexual     energy           stored  up, there
    is a chance      that          it might not last
    very   long.

               ANDY
    This is what I was worried          about.
    If I am honest,     she'll    think   I am
    defective.      If I have sex it will
    be bad and she won't       want to be
    with me.   I'll    never   get a second
    chance.

        Hold on, relax.
        you some advice
        want you to just
                               I am going to give
                             right    now.
                               take it because
                                              And I
                                                     I
                                                                               96.




        know what I am talking         about.      I
        took my girlfriend         for granted.      I
        didn't   appreciate      her.    I didn't
        accept   that   she was the best person
        could ever dream of.          And because
        of that,    I almost     lost  her.     But
        now that    I have been honest        with
        her,     we are       going        to     have      a long
        life     together.            And a child.

                    J!.!,ffi'RE)
        So you think      I should                  just     tell        her
        everything.

                      JAY
        No.    I think   you should    get it on
        with that girl     Beth from the
        bookstore.      Pay attention.     Learn
        as     much as       you    can,         then      use    that
        knowledge          with     Trish.

                           ANDY
        That     doesn't          sound      ethical.

                       JAY
        What, she likes        you. She wants
        you.      You would be giving    her
        something     she wants.    What's
        unethical     about that.    You aren't
        asking     her to marry you so you can
        steal     her fortune.

                           ANDY
        That     makes      sense.

                           JAY
         I think      it    is what             Trish      would
        want.

                        ANDY
        Thank      you, Jay.   I know I have been
        tough      on you, but without    your
        advice      I wouldn't  have gotten    this
        far.

                   JAY
        Thanks.   That means a a lot                             to   me.
        Now go get that  girl.

                   Hey.

                                      ANDY
                   I was going           to ask      you to hang out
                   after work          tonight,       but I heard you
                   were busy.

                                     BETH
                   Busy      with    what?

                                       ANDY
                   Busy hanging          out      with    me after
                   work.

She is     not      sure      what     this    means,     but         she   smiles.            She   likes
him.

     INT. ANDY'S BATHROOM- DUSK

     Andy is      preparing                for     his         date.
                                                                                                                              98.




     Quick     Cuts:
     *Andy     irons         his         socks     and underwear.

     *Using     a hand             mirror         to      see     his         back,     he waxes           some       stray
     strips     of      hair.
     *Andy puts             deodorant             on his          underarms,              and his          palms.

     *Andy trims             his         nose     hair.           Then plucks              his     uni-brow.

     *Andy opens his mouth.       He is wearing   the                                            teeth      whitening
     strips   made by Crest.    He takes   them off,                                             then      smiles   at         the
     results.     Then he scrapes    his tongue.
     *Andy pulls              a Biori            strip          off     his     nose.         He looks           at    it,     then
     grimaces          in     disgust.

     *We reveal        that Andy's   entire     face is                                 covered          with     Biori
     strips.         He starts peeling      them off.
     *Andy opens a very large     box of condoms                                           and puts             one in his
     wallet.    He has to discard    lots of other                                          business             and credit
     cards   to make room for it.

                                                                                                                  CUT TO:

     Trish,      Julia         and Marla                 are     sitting          at    the      kitchen         table
     waiting       for        Andy.
                                         TRISH
                            This is so unlike     him. He always
                            comes straight    over from work.

      They hear             a noise         at     the         door.
                                                TRISH
                            Shhhh.           That's  him.                  Come on.

      They al.l        walk         to     the     door.              Trish      throws       it    open.

                                                EVERYONE
                            Happy         Birthday!!!!

                                                      ANDY
                             Do you like                working         at     the
                             bookstore?

                                          BETH
                             Yeah.   It's   really  quiet.       We don't
                             have that    many customers      and the
                             ones we do have are really          mellow.
                             Which is good because       I used to
                             work at a restaurant,       and it was
                             really  busy and hectic,       and I could
                             never get the orders      right,     so I
                             kind of got fired.

                             Not really.     I'm not much of a
                             reader.     I'm more of a do-er.       But
                             they have a great    magazine    rack,   so
                             I like   to read those.                           I know
                             they're    not books,   but                       some of         them
                             are pretty     long.

        Andy is           trying      to     stay        interested             in    Beth,      but. it      is

         not sure what to do.

                                             BETH
                         I am gonna           eat you       up.

        She kisses        him     on the mouth,    then walks                     to    the   bathroom,
        smiles   at      him,     then closes   the door.

                         So you       have       no idea      where          he is?

                         No.       I can 1 t imagine               where he would
                         go.

                                             MARLA

                I am pregnant.                     If       you     did        that,          it
                would be sick.

INT.   BETH'S        APARTMENT/BATHROOM - NIGHT

Andy    is   waiting          in     the      living          room.

                            BETH
                     (from behind                       the     bathroom
                      door)
                Come on in.

Andy walks          into   the         bathroom,              and       Beth          is     completely     naked.
Andy takes          a breath.

                                           BETH
                Do you             like?

                I     like.

She    walks    over      to        him      and takes            off     his          shirt.

                                           BETH
                Let      me help             you with           that.

She takes       off      his pants.                He gets  pale.                          She leans     down      and
takes    off    his      underwear.                (The nudity    is                       mainly   tastefully
hidden.)

                                       ANDY
                I could             have gotten                that,       but             thank

                        Before  we start   I want                                    to     show you
                        what gives   me pleasure.

     She gets         in        the     tub.             Her hand               moves           down her          body.

     CLOSE UP OF ANDY

     For    the      next        full         minute                 we are      on a medium                   shot        of     Andy          s
     face     as     Beth        pleasures                   herself.
     We do not          hear a lot                      of     noise.            A little              breathing                and    the
     occasional          splash.
     Andy's      face           goes through     a kaleidoscope      of emotions:
     interested,                happy,  shocked,    ashamed,    frightened.

     ANGLE ON THE BATH
     We see         Beth for a moment                                from an angle  which                       disguises               what
     she is         doing,  but we see                               her ecstatic  face.

     ANGLE ON WHERE ANDY WAS
      Andy is        now gone.                     He must             have      run        out     in      the       four         seconds
      the    camera         was         off        of     him.

      Andy walks out                    the front  door                        and    is        surprised             to        find---Jay
      about to knock                    on the door.

                                                        JAY
                            Don't         do       it.

                            What?

      In the         background                we hear the quiet    sounds                                  of Beth              moaning.
      As the         scene plays                out she gets  louder    and                                 louder.

                            Trish,            then           it'll       all     wurk           uuL.      I'm

                                    I didn't. But if you
                           get out of my way, she might
                                                                                                               104.

                     you.     She's              really   worried.

                                           ANDY
                     Okay.         I'll      get in        touch        with        her
                     right    away.

     They   both     hear    the          moaning.

                                         JAY
                     What is         going on in there?                        Is
                     someone         else   in there?

                     Just    Beth.

                     Maybe     I should              go in     there.

                                            ANDY
                      I wouldn't.

                                            JAY
                      Yeah, you're             right.          That      was
                      stupid.

     They   listen   for      another      beat   as Beth                 reaches            her      peak,    then
     both   run off--for         different      reasons.


     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

     Andy rides his bicycle                       home, anxious            to       call      Trish      and    tell
     her how much he cares                       for her.


     EXT./INT.        ANDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Andy    locks     his   bike,           and     enters     his      home.

     When he       enters,     he         sees     Trish      looking          very        upset.

                                      ANDY
                             (attempting    nonchalance)

                                           should          tell             me.

                       Okay, here's   the                    thing.    I realize
                       I made a mistake.                        The reason    I
                       went      out--

                                                ANDY
                         Now I'm             ready.

About Time
  By Richard Curtis




      Page 1/61

I always knew we
were a fairly odd family.
First there was me.
Too tall. Too skinny.
Too orange.
My mum was lovely,
but not like other mums.
There was
something solid about her.
Something rectangular,
busy and unsentimental.
Her fashion icon was the Queen.
Dad, well, he was more normal. He always
seemed to have time on his hands.
After giving up teaching university
students on his 50th birthday,
he was eternally available
for a leisurely chat or
to let me win at table tennis.
Yes.
And then there was Mum's
brother, Uncle Desmond.
Always impeccably dressed. He
spent the days just, well,
being Uncle Desmond.
He was the most charming and least
clever man you could ever meet.
His mind was on other things,
though we never found out what.
And then,
finally there was Catherine.
Katie. Kit Kat. My sister.
In a household of sensible jackets
and haircuts there was this,
well, what can I call her,
nature thing.
With her elfin eyes, her purple
T-shirts and her eternally bare feet,
she was then,
and still is to me,
about the most wonderful
thing in the world.
All in all, it was a pretty good childhood.
Full of repeated rhythms and patterns.


                                 Page 2/61

By the time I was 21,
we were still
having tea on the beach
every single day.
Skimming stones and
eating sandwiches,
summer and winter,
no matter what the weather.
And every Friday evening,
a film,
no matter what the weather.
And then once a year, the
dreaded New Year's Eve party.
Yeah, I might just get one.
You're absolutely gorgeous.
I'm Katie. What am I drinking?
This is very expensive stuff.
Cheers. Cheers.
Come on, it's nearly midnight.
We're all going through.
We're going through.
Look, I've gotta find you a...
God!
Everyone makes little mistakes.
It's fine. Come on.
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year.
Sorry.
And so I woke up
the next morning,
hung-over, ashamed of myself,
and not realising
it was the day
that would change
my life forever.
Get up, stupid.
Dad wants you.
Hello. Sexy pyjamas.
Tim, come in.
Do
sit down.
That's very formal.
Well, um, yeah.


                                  Page 3/61

This is an odd moment for me
because I had
the same moment with my
father when I'd just
turned 21, and after it,
my life was never the same, so I
approach it pretty, um, nervously.
Okay.
When you're ready.
It's all very mysterious.
Right.
Tim, my dear son, the...
The simple fact is
the men in this family
have always had
the ability to...
This is going to sound strange,
be prepared for strangeness.
Get ready for spooky time,
but there's this family secret.
And the secret is that
the men in the family can
travel in time.
Well, more accurately,
travel back in time.
We can't travel
into the future.
This is such a weird joke.
?t's seriously not a joke.
So you're saying that you and
granddad, and his brothers
could all travel back in time?
Absolutely.
And you still do? Absolutely.
Although it's not as dramatic as it sounds.
It's only in my own life.
I can only go to places where I
actually was and can remember.
I can't kill Hitler or shag
Helen of Troy, unfortunately.
Okay, stop.
Um...
if it's true, which it isn't.
Although it is.


                                 Page 4/61

Although it isn't, obviously. But if
it was, which it's not. Which it is.
Which it isn't.
But if it was, how would I...
The ?'How?' is
the easy bit, in fact.
You go into a dark place,
big cupboards are
very useful generally.
Toilets, at a pinch.
Then you clench
your fists like this.
Think of the moment
you're going to
and you'll find yourself there.
After a bit of a stumble
and a rumble and a tumble.
Wow.
Is as good a reaction as any.
I think I plumped for ?'fuck!?'
but it was the '70s.
No, this is
so obviously a joke.
?t's not a joke.
Why would I lie to someone I'm
fairly fond of?
Okay.
But, when I come
back downstairs
after standing in a cupboard
with my fists clenched,
you're gonna be
in so much trouble.
Well,
let's see, shall we?
And, Tim, try and
do something interesting.
So much trouble.
I mean it. Really.
Right.
Wow!
You all right, Tim?
Yes. Yeah. Good, ace. Yeah.
Good, come on. it's nearly


                                 Page 5/61

midnight and we've got to find...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoo! Midnight.
10, 9, 8, 7,
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Happy New Year!
Thank you, Tim.
You're welcome, Polly.
Does Mum know?
Not a whistle.
Strange. And what about the whole...
Butterfly effect thing. What can I say?
We don't seem to have
messed up civilisation yet.
?t's gonna be
a complicated year.
?t's gonna be
a complicated life.
What have you
done with it?
For me,
it's books, books, books.
I've read everything
a man could wish to.
Twice. Dickens three times.
Any first thoughts?
Well, I suppose apart from getting
a slightly better haircut... Yeah.
Money would be
the obvious thing.
Very mixed blessing.
Utterly screwed up
your grandfather's life.
Left him without
love or friends.
I've never bumped into a
genuinely happy rich person.
?t would be nice
not to have to work.
No, that's a real
recipe for disaster.
Look what happened to Uncle Fred.
What happened to Uncle Fred?
Absolutely sod all.


                                 Page 6/61

Wasted his life.
You have to use it for
things that you really think
will make your life
the way you want it to be.
Come on,
really think about this.
Well,
to be honest,
I suppose, at the moment,
it would be just great if it
could help me get a girlfriend.
Wow.
Massive. Yeah.
The mothership.
For me, it was always
gonna be about love.
And that summer I walked
into the eye of the storm.
Her name was Charlotte.
Cousin of Kit Kat's
handsome but
nasty boyfriend Jimmy.
And she was staying
for two whole months.
Just one. Not both of them.
Tim,
will you do my back?
Absolutely!
Very keen!
Whoa! No. No.
No. No, no. No, no, no.
Is it in my hair? Yes!
Tim. Will you do my back?
Sure. Just give us a sec.
Okay.
Thank you.
Now...
Ooh. Nice.
?t's my area.
it was a summer of
suntan and torture.
I invited my foolish friend
Jay around for tennis


                                  Page 7/61

because I thought
he'd make me look good.
I was wrong!
What are you doing? No.
Charlotte just made both
of us look like idiots.
Bad luck, Tim.
How the hell are you meant
to concentrate on your game?
How are you meant
to live your life
with this sort of
shit going down?
It never got better
until suddenly
it was almost too late.
Well, Charlotte,
our final lunch.
No!
And it's been really, really
lovely having you all summer.
it has.
Thank you.
Thank you.
?t really has.
Hasn't it, Desmond?
Beg your pardon?
Lovely having
Charlotte here all summer.
Charlotte? Who's Charlotte?
Come on, darling. Charlotte,
sitting next to you.
Yes, of course. Of course.
Charlotte. Hi.
Lovely to meet you.
Have you enjoyed having
Charlotte here all summer, Tim?
Yeah.
There goes August.
I've introduced him to
most things, haven't I?
You did. You were
much more sophisticated.
In a quiet way,


                                  Page 8/61

I like to think.
Come in.
Charlotte. Yeah!
As it's your last night,
can I ask you a question?
Yeah. Ask away.
No, wait.
?t's not going to
be about love, is it?
Love? What?
Well, it's just that Kit Kat warned me that
if you were to ever mention it, I should be
very firm with you and tell you
you must treat me
like your sister
and not be stupid.
Or have I just made
a total fool of myself
and you were actually
going to ask me for
late night last
minute tennis tips?
No, it was the love thing.
Well.
That's very sweet of you.
?t's just a shame you
left it till the last night.
You should have tried creeping along
the corridor while we still had time.
Okay, the ?'last night?'
was a bad idea?
Very bad idea. it feels like an ever
so slightly insulting afterthought.
?'Last night?' was
never going to work.
All right. Good. I've got it.
Come in.
Tim. Hi. Charlotte.
Hi. Sit down.
I know you've
probably suspected this,
but over the last month I've fallen
completely in love with you.
Now obviously


                                 Page 9/61

this was gonna happen
because you're
a goddess with that face
and that hair,
but even if you
didn't have a nice face,
and even if you had
absolutely no hair
because of some
bizarre medical reason,
I'd still adore you,
and I...
I just wondered whether, by any
chance, you might share my feelings.
Wow.
I tell you what.
Why don't we see
how the summer goes
and then you ask me
again on my last night?
Your last night? Yes.
Try me on the last night. See
what happens then, shall we?
?t's exciting.
Right.
No, it's a perfect plan. That's
absolutely perfect. Last night.
Last night.
Thanks very much.
Night-night, Timmy.
Big lesson number one,
all the time travel in the world
can't make someone love you.
Bye!
So the love of my life
just drove away.
And the very next day
it was my turn to leave.
There you go. Don't
spend it all at once.
Thanks.
Don't call too often, your mother
doesn't like to be disturbed.
Okay. Thanks.


                                 Page 10/61

I caught the train to London in
search of a future and a girlfriend.
I was staying in St John's
Wood, near Abbey Road,
with a playwright friend
of my dad's called Harry.
It's always nice to have family connections
when you're a new kid in town.
What the fuck do you want?
I'm James's son.
Who?
James Lake. What about him?
He said you had a room.
Go in there and wait.
Quietly. I mean it,
don't make a sound.
Or I'll kill you.
I was actually having the first
good idea I've had for a decade
when you rang on the doorbell.
But now it's gone.
You little shit.
How's your dad?
Weird cock, I always thought.
Something weird about him.
Really?
Yeah, I never really
liked him, actually.
Your mum still
look like Andy Warhol?
What?
That, by the way, is my wife.
Nice.
Yeah, you wouldn't
like her at first.
Sarcastic cow.
But eventually
you'd realise that
she's the best human
being in the world.
Which is why she
left me, of course.
Here you go.
Try not to make too much noise,


                                 Page 11/61

particularly when having sex.
No chance of that.
Christ,
two losers in one house.
That is my daughter.
Have sex with her if you like.
Apparently everyone else has.
It wasn't a hopeful
set-up for romance.
And work didn't help
on that score either.
The world of law seems to
be entirely full of men.
Hello. I'm Rory. Very pleased to meet you.
A real thrill.
Well, who knows, we might become,
you know, pals, et cetera.
Who the hell are you? Tim Lake.
Well, I hope you're
better than this clown.
Come on, Roger.
?t's Rory, actually.
I've been here
a year and a half.
I'm just saying that to be nice.
It's two years actually.
So six lonely months went by
and it was still just me and Harry.
Me lawyer-ing every hour
of the day and night.
And him putting the finishing
touches to his new play.
No matter how many girls
there were in the world,
I always seemed to
end up with Rory.
Hello.
Until, out of the blue,
on a dodgy night out with dodgy
Jay, something miraculous happened.
The waiters are,
wait for this,
right, they're blind.
You're kidding me?


                                 Page 12/61

I'm kidding you not.
No, as bats. As bats!
Very good to
have you here, gentlemen.
I hope you enjoy
your experience.
Carlo will show
you to your table.
Great. Lead on, maestro.
Can I have your right hand on
my right shoulder, please?
And your friend hold on to your shoulder.
Thank you.
Mind the stairs and
be prepared because
it's completely dark.
Okay, gentlemen,
if you don't mind,
I can sit you here beside
these two young ladies.
No, no.
Sounds absolutely perfect!
God,
you sound very perky.
I am. And very handsome.
Someone's there.
Hi. Hi. I'm Mary.
I'm Tim. Mary's my
mother's name, actually.
Does it suit her? Sort of.
Although she's sturdy, so Bernard
might have been a better fit.
Okay.
Something just
touched my elbow.
Okay, that wasn't me.
No. Well, that just makes it worse.
If it wasn't you, who was it?
it wasn't me because I'm
touching something else.
Yes, and you'll stop
that right away, thank you.
So, girls, be honest,
who is more beautiful?


                                 Page 13/61

- I am.
- Yeah. She is.
Excellent!
Actually,
I look like Kate Moss.
Really?
No. I sort of
look like a squirrel.
Do you like Kate Moss?
I absolutely love her.
In fact, I almost wore one of
her dresses here tonight. You?
No, no, her clothes
look terrible on me.
I cannot believe that it's
your birthday next week as well.
Your friend Jay is
quite enthusiastic.
I actually hate him.
What's Joanna like?
- She's basically a prostitute.
- Yeah.
I think it's strawberry mousse.
Ooh!
Do you want some?
Um... Okay. I'll try it.
Okay, where's your mouth?
?t's...
it's here.
Okay. There?
My God, what was that?
That's my eye.
I think there's a lot of...
I've got quite a lot of
strawberry mousse
in my eye now!
I'm so sorry.
No. Thank you. That's
a new sensation for me.
So, maybe I'll see
you outside or...
Yeah. Yeah, great.
Great. Scary.
Yeah, it's a bit scary.


                                   Page 14/61

My God, I'm so in there.
What about you?
I don't know,
but she sounded wonderful.
Shh!
Joanna? Jay.
Christ, you're a babe.
How do you fancy
stretching the night
out a bit?
I can ditch the loser.
We've got to rush, but help me find a
cab and I might give you my number.
Of course. Yeah.
Or I might not.
Haven't decided yet. So...
I have. it's not gonna happen.
Hi. Hi.
Where's... She
and Jay just...
She took him to...
I don't know.
Right.
Well, I guess I'd better...
Would it be very wrong if I
asked you for your number?
No.
Just in case I ever
had to call you about...
Stuff? -
Okay.
Would you...
it's Mary.
Mary.
Okay.
I thought this phone
was old and shit,
but suddenly it's my most
valuable possession.
You really like me?
Even my frock?
I love your frock.
And my hair?
It's not too brown?


                                 Page 15/61

I love brown.
My fringe is new.
The fringe is perfect.
Fringe is the best bit.
Mary!
We have to go! I found a cab and his
dodgy friend is about to assault me.
Okay, I'm coming.
Two seconds.
I hope I see you again.
You will.
Okay. Good.
Goodnight.
What's happened?
What have you done,
you poor thing?
Nothing.
It's just a flesh wound.
Here. Thank you.
You may remember,
my play opened tonight.
My God, yes. How did it go?
Well. it went well.
You could tell in the room a
masterpiece was being unfurled.
Really? Really.
Until, and this is the
crucial plot point, I think,
until the lead actor had the most
massive dry in the history of theatre.
No, no, no. Yes, yes, yes.
He didn't just
forget his lines.
He forgot his lines
to the extent
that no actor has ever
forgotten their lines
before in
the annals of dramatic art.
The reviews won't say,?'Major masterpiece
gets unveiled, ?'
they'll say, ?'Major
actor gets Alzheimer's.?'
it's a disaster.


                                 Page 16/61

Is an understatement.
?t's the Titanic of play
openings, but with no survivors.
No women, no children,
not even Kate Winslet.
All dead.
Okay. I'll see what I can do.
What does that mean?
What are you gonna do?
Ring up every critic
in London and
offer them a blow job
if they ignore the fact that we sat
in total silence for half an hour
waiting for a moron to
remember one single line?
Not quite that.
Hello.
Hello, Sir Tom. I'm a friend of Harry's.
How's it going with the lines?
I'm sorry,
what do you mean ?'the lines?'?
?t's just, you know,
in the court scenes,
some of those lines
are pretty complex.
And I just thought maybe it
might be worth, you know,
having one last
look at the lines
before you go on.
A little refresher.
Fuck off out of here.
You arsing lunatic. Get out!
You ginger twerp. Go on!
Patronising piece of...
And now the Defence.
I have lived
many weary years...
it's brilliant... but never,
in that long catalogue
of wasted time,
have I ever seen such an atrocious
miscarriage of justice.


                                 Page 17/61

Do the Prosecution have
anything final to add?
Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.
Do the Prosecution have
anything final to add?
Psst!
Gentlemen...
Gentlemen,
I regard today's proceedings
with the utmost gravity.
Nevertheless,
let us be clear of one
simple and salient thing.
?t is the life
of a guilty man!
One of the actors appeared
to have actually fallen asleep...
Here's the little prick who
walked out halfway through.
You missed the best scene,
you little twerp.
Sorry.
What did you think of the set?
I thought it was incredible.
Did you? I didn't. Too brown.
Mary!
No.
She's gone.
Two girls in earlier tonight. One of
them the prettiest girl in the world.
The other one like a
sort of nice prostitute.
Did you get their names?
Yes. They left
a while ago. Let's see.
No, I'm afraid
they were walk-ins
and it appears
they paid by cash.
Sorry, sir.
That's okay.
That's fine, it's brilliant.
?t's just the end of my life.
Thanks so much.


                                 Page 18/61

Cheer up, mate.
Apparently, you're living with
Britain's greatest living playwright.
I don't usually
read them, obviously,
but I couldn't resist this one.
?'Harry Chapman
found guilty of genius.?'
I have to go out. Right now.
Why?
She loves Kate Moss.
Thanks for keeping
me company, Kittle.
Nothing better to do.
How's Jimmy?
Dumped me.
Not again.
And work? They've sacked me.
Idiots.
Coffee? Please.
I've only just noticed this cat
in this picture. See that cat?
I do see that cat.
It's very good.
My God.
My God!
What?
it's her.
?t's her!
That's her!
Shh!
You go, girl.
Sorry.
Hi. Hi.
How are you?
I'm... I'm fine.
?t's so good to see you.
Um... We've never met before.
No, fuck.
No, of course we haven't. No.
Sorry, I think you've
mistaken me for someone else.
No, no, no.
Your name's Mary.


                                 Page 19/61

That's distinctly weird.
How do you know that?
Well, you look like a Mary.
In what way?
My mum's called Mary.
I look like your mother?
No. You're much prettier.
?t's a nice fringe, by the way.
God, it's new and
probably too short but... No.
Well, gee, thank you and
listen, it was
really nice to meet you.
I should probably go because
my friend's waiting for me
and you're a,
you're a total stranger.
Total stranger.
Yeah, it's crazy stuff.
Yeah, kind of. Okay.
Bye, Mary. Bye.
No.
How did it go?
?t was very poor.
Very poor indeed, yeah.
You gotta go again.
You can do it. Take two.
She just always... She
always looks different.
Sorry. it's me again.
Hi. Sorry.
Joanna, this is...
Tim.
Hello. Nice to meet you.
Tim is a total stranger whose
mother's name is Mary.
I just had a weird
experience with Mary here
of thinking she was someone else.
But she wasn't.
But I just wondered if I
could walk round with you
for a while because my sister
Kit Kat is about to leave...


                                    Page 20/61

Yeah.
Bye... and...
And so,
I'm about to be quite lonely.
Right. Well, I think we
should probably say no.
No, yes. But on the other hand,
he's got a quite nice smile
and sort of,
you know, fun hair.
Yeah.
All right.
But you have to promise that you are
not one of the following things.
One, a lunatic.
Yeah. No.
Two, a fringe fetishist.
I'm just Kate Moss's
number one male fan.
God. Really?
Yeah. God, yeah.
Do you agree that the magic
of her lies in her history?
That the informality
of her early shots
compared to this stuff
so you just always know
that, despite the high
fashion, she's still just
that cheeky normal
naked girl on the beach?
Couldn't have put
it better myself.
That's absolutely it.
I agree with that profoundly.
Milk?
Yes.
Sugar? No.
Boyfriend?
Yes!
No. No, you don't
have a boyfriend.
Do I not look like
I'd have a boyfriend?


                                 Page 21/61

Do I look like I'd never
get a boyfriend? No.
That's the rudest thing
I've ever heard.
I didn't mean it like that.
I just didn't expect...
Is it quite a new boyfriend?
Yes.
There he is. Rupert.
Yes. He's so cute. Rupert?
Hi, guys.
Sorry I'm late, with my dad.
Hi, Rupee.
?'Rupee?'?
Well, this is Tim and
we don't know him at all.
Hey, I was thinking we could
take in a film after this.
Get some mixed popcorn,
share a Coke,
snuggle. Okay.
Okay.
When did you two meet? Exactly?
Well, it was only
a week ago, actually.
?t's all been a bit of a
whirlwind, hasn't it, poochy face?
I'm gonna have to teach you what you
can and can't say in front of people.
No ?'poochy face?'? No.
No. Definitely not.
Come on, then. More details about
this wonderful first meeting?
Okay, okay.
?t was, um, what... Joanna?
June 17th.
And Jo was
having a little party.
A living hell from which
Rupert, thank God, rescued me.
And where was
this terrible party?
My brothel of a flat.
Which is where, though? That's


                                 Page 22/61

the question, isn't it.
What are you, a detective?
No, sorry, I've just got
a very visual imagination.
I like to imagine
stuff completely.
26 Courtfield Gardens,

SW5. Around 8:
Dress code, slutty.
Will that do?
Absolutely, yes.
Although I am wondering
when you got there, Rupert.
Early, late?
On time, I think.
True love was calling.
God.
I actually feel a bit
sick now. Just these
muffins, I think.
Never trust a blueberry.
Okay, I'll be back in a tick.
You two are such
a lovely couple.
Bit weird.
He's cute.
I like him.
Yeah, me too.
Hello. Do I know you?
No, no, no.
I'm a friend of Mary's.
She has another friend? Gosh,
you amaze me. But hooray.
Ooh. Hotdog?
Took me hours.
Made them myself.
Thanks.
Disgusting.
Totally undercooked.
See you later.
Why don't we go upstairs,
it's a bit quieter?
Hi. Hi.


                                Page 23/61

I'm Tim.
Mary.
That's my mother's name.
Let's not get into that.
Um... I know this is forward but
your face tells me that you're finding
this party to be a living hell.
So, I just wondered
if you might come
and have a bite to
eat with me instead?
Right now.
I'm sorry?
Obviously, I should have
thought this through more.
Let's talk about Kate Moss.
I love Kate Moss.
I always think the key thing
with her is the history,
you know, the informality of her early
shots compared to high fashion stuff
so you always know that underneath
she's still just the same
cheeky normal girl
naked on the beach.
The beach.
I agree with you completely.
?f we leave now then we can have,
you know, more than one starter.
I love your eyes.
And I love the rest
of your face, too.
More than one starter?
10 amazing starters.
After you. Thanks.
Ten minutes is long enough
for any party, I think.
Yeah.
Especially that one.
Evening, all.
God! What a dickhead.
Yeah.
So, what do you do?
I'm a reader at a publisher.


                                 Page 24/61

No! You read for a living?
Yes, that's it. I read.
That's so great.
?t's like someone asking,
?'What do you do
?'for a living??'
?'Well, I breathe.
?'l'm a breather,
I get paid for breathing.?'
How did you get that job? Okay,
smart-ass, what do you do?
I am a lawyer.
Sort of. Sort of.
That's sexy.
Is it?
I mean, I think so.
In a suit, in a court, saving
people's lives. Kinda sexy.
I guess it is. Although it's
not as sexy as reading.
Sitting there in an office,
in a little chair reading.
Okay, stop. Ooh!
Just wait right there,
mister, because
a lot of books get
submitted to my publisher.
So it's an immense
responsibility.
I bet it is.
But when you do normal reading,
is it ruined because it's your job?
You know, like prostitutes?
I always worry that when
they stop being prostitutes
that they can't
enjoy sex any more.
You always worry about that?
No, I sometimes worry about it.
Good. Okay.
Because someone who always worried
about that would be a bit of a worry.
When you read a newspaper,
do you think,?'Forget this, it's work?'?


                                 Page 25/61

Have you interviewed
a lot of prostitutes?
When you read a menu,
do you think,
?'No, I'm not reading this,
unless you pay me hard cash.?'
How many prostitutes will you need to
talk to before this issue is solved?
Are you planning to head to
Eastern Europe and Thailand?
Um... Would you like
to walk me to my car?
Yes. Why not? Okay.
Sounds like a good idea.
What about you?
Yeah, I have
three older brothers.
God. Yeah.
Where are they?
Behind you.
Did you have trouble parking?
Pardon?
?t's just such
a long way to your car.
Well, my car's
actually parked outside
my house.
I got a lift to the party.
Okay.
That's good. That's perfect.
Okay.
And here we are.
My God. Yeah.
Car, house. House, car.
?t makes perfect sense.
?t's very logical.
Christ.
Um...
Keys!
I'm gonna go into the bedroom
and put on my new pyjamas.
Right.
And then in a minute you can
come in and take them off.


                                 Page 26/61

?f you want to.
One minute.
Hi.
God. Are you... Are you okay?
Yeah.
Sorry.
That's okay.
?t's a front opener.
?t's a what?
?t opens from the front.
Yeah, no, yeah, of course.
Thanks. Sure.
Ooh! Well done.
I'm sure it'll be
better next time.
I thought it was pretty lovely.
Right, no,
it was really lovely.
In fact, can you
just give me one minute?
Okay.
Hi.
Dangerous.
You really know your bras.
I like to think so.
Well done. Some people make a
real mess of it the first time.
Amateurs.
Could you give me one second?
Sure.
I couldn't wait.
My goodness.
Best night of my entire life. And now
I've got a suspicion I'm gonna have
the best sleep
of my entire life.
So once is enough
for my perfect guy?
I'm not sure
that's entirely fair.
We're late. No, we're not.
?t'll be fine. it's only...
My God.
Bye.


                                 Page 27/61

Don't worry,
you're coming with.
I'm taking you home!
Bye. Bye. Bye.
No!
Okay. I have some bad news.
You're dying? No, not that bad.
I'm dying? No.
My parents are in town. They're
visiting and they're coming around.
God. Parents?
American parents?
When? Now.
They told me and
I didn't tell you
and I thought they'd cancel because
they normally do and they didn't.
Now now? Now now.
So you should probably
put on some pants.
God. Okay, okay.
I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.
Do
they know I exist?
Yeah. I've mentioned something
like you, but nothing very specific.
Yeah, they're quite conservative,
so maybe not those pants.
Okay. Yeah.
God. Okay.
Could you just stall them.
Stall them.
Come on up.
What? I'm sorry, they
don't like waiting.
Okay. Do I live here?
Definitely not.
Are we having sex?
Yeah. But not oral.
I wasn't gonna mention oral.
Okay, good, don't. How did you
think that was gonna come up?
Could you help me


                                 Page 28/61

with this, please?
I don't know. if it does,
just deny it completely.
Who's gonna bring it up?
Your dad?
?'Tim, had any cunnilingus
with my daughter recently??'
Well, you never know.
Okay.
Okay. Ready? Yeah.
They're there.
They are, yeah.
Yeah, right behind you.
Okay. Right, okay.
Dad! Hello, sweet.
Mom. Hi. Hi, honey.
This is Tim.
Hello, sir. Ma'am.
Should we come back when you
haven't got any company, or...
Well, that would be
quite difficult
because Tim
actually lives here.
Really? With you?
Yes. Yeah, but no
oral sex, I promise you.
I beg your pardon?
Excuse me.
So, Tim, tell us where are you
from, which part of the country?
He's from Cornwall.
Yeah, it's really pretty.
?t's that little bit right at the
end, sort of looks like a shoe.
And you're a lawyer,
is that right?
Yep, that's right.
And he never loses.
You don't think he's gonna win, then he
just pulls something out of the bag and,
what do you know,
he wins again.
Do you ever answer


                                 Page 29/61

any of your own questions?
I...
Yes, he does. Usually he does,
but not today because I'm doing
all the talking
because I'm really nervous
and I kinda love him and I just...
l want you to, too.
Honey.
Sorry. Tim. Over to you.
Shoot.
Yeah, I think my dad...
Can I just say one more thing?
Um...
Thank God that's over.
I got given two tickets
for the National Theatre
tomorrow. Do you wanna come?
No, so not. I'm just
gonna sleep all day.
I don't see why going to the theatre
should get in the way of that.
Many of the best sleeps of my life have
happened in the Royal Shakespeare Company.
No, you take someone else.
I really like bed and
I really hate theatre.
Quite right.
But what kind of sad act is gonna
be free on a Saturday night
with no day's notice?
Bravo.
My God. it's Charlotte. Who?
?t was my first love. Where?
There. Under the ?'exit?' sign.
- The old woman?
- No, not the old woman.
The astonishing blonde.
The one with the dark hair?
No, blonde.
Blonde means
blonde hair, doesn't it?
Off the stage.
Okay, you stay there.


                                 Page 30/61

I mean it, stay!
Charlotte.
My God. Tim.
How fabulous to see you.
Wow. I... This is
my girlfriend Tina.
No.
That is so brilliant.
Well, hello, Tina.
Why is it brilliant?
Well, you know. There are certain moments
in your life that scar you for life.
Charlotte's rejection of me
was one of those moments,
but now I know she's
got a ?'girlfriend, ?' well,
that's just a huge burden
suddenly lifted off my mind.
I can be a confident
heterosexual all over again.
Not that kind of girlfriend.
What?
You think I'm gay?
No.
No, of course not.
No. it's girl friend.
Yes. No. Wow.
Yeah, friend who is a girl,
which you so clearly are.
I'm just gonna go and get my
boyfriend, who is a boy...
My God. Tim.
How lovely to see you.
Look at you. Wow.
This is my girlfriend Tina.
Hello, Tina.
Although you should be
a little careful
with that, by the way.
There are still quite a lot of
us old fashioned types about
who interpret
?'girlfriend?'as meaning ?'gay.?'
So if you say that Tina's your girlfriend,


                                 Page 31/61

people will assume that you're ?'gay.?'
I am ?'gay.?'
Are you?
Do you have
a problem with that?
No, I don't. I love that stuff.
I'm just gonna...
Wow.
I've just seen the girl who broke
my heart three summers ago.
Let's go say hello.
No. Best let sleeping dogs lie.
Come on.
Best night of my life.
I always love this area.
?t's so bustling and I mean
those pictures, full of colour.
Just makes me so happy when I'm
round here, all the colour... Tim.
Charlotte!
Tim, how lovely to see you.
What a surprise.
Wow. Sorry. This is
my girlfriend, Tina.
She's gay. Shut up.
Hello, Tina.
Look at you!
?t just never
even occurred to me
you existed
outside of Cornwall.
We're about to
go and get dinner,
but it would be great
to hang out sometime.
Yeah, sure. I'd love that.
Send my love to little Kit Kat.
How is she?
She's okay. She's not finding
London totally easy actually.
Right. Well, Jimmy says
he sees her sometimes.
Really? Since when?
You knew there was


                                 Page 32/61

always something there.
Sorry, you are?
Very well, thank you.
Well, she means your name.
Roger. No, it's not.
No, it's not. it's Rory.
Nice to meet you, Rory. Yeah.
Right. Sorry,
we should get going.
?t was really great to see you.
I'll see you soon.
You, too. Yeah.
Bye.
God, she is beautiful.
She's so beautiful, if you had sex
with her, you'd die. You'd just die.
You'd open her shirt, see her breasts
and your eyes would explode.
You'd have to have sex with her blind.
And then you'd die.
You notice she didn't
give me her number...
I told Tina to go have dinner on her own.
Are you hungry?
Yeah. Of course. Great.
Bye, Roger.
Yeah, excellent.
Thanks again for the play. Triumph.
Where do you wanna go?
Well, wherever you like really.
I can't compete.
You know,
I'm starting to think we slightly
wasted that summer holiday.
?f we could
travel back in time,
maybe I wouldn't have said no.
I'm...
I'm just staying
round the corner.
Can you walk me home?
Yeah.
Yeah? Yeah, of course, yeah.
Well, here we are.


                                 Page 33/61

it's a lot nicer
inside.
I'm sure it is.
So... So...
So...
So,
lovely
to see you, Charlotte.
What a night.
Total joy, but I've gotta
get back
because there's something very important
that I have to do. Right now.
Wake up. Wake up. What?
Mary.
Would you like to marry me?
Shh.
Don't be so selfish,
I'm sleeping. it's bad.
Right.
That went very well.
Wake up.
What?
Wake up. Come and have a chat.
Why?
I've got something
important to ask you.
Can't it wait till morning?
Not really.
But I'm so comfy.
I was having
the loveliest dream.
What is it?
Why is there music on?
?t's got something to do
with what I want to ask you.
Wait a minute.
Romantic music.
Guy with important question.
Are you on your knees?
On his knees.
Were you so bored in
the play you decided
to ask me to


                                 Page 34/61

marry you afterwards?
Something like that.
Yeah. Exactly that.
In fact,
will you marry me?
Any thoughts on the answer?
?'Yes??' ?'No??' ?'Get out of my life,
loser.?' They're all possible.
I think I'll go for
?'yes.?'
Thank you for asking me.
And thank you for not going for one
of those melodramatic proposals
with lots of people around.
I hate other people.
Me, too.
Yeah.
I'm just gonna
turn off the radio.
Okay. Good idea.
Thanks, guys.
Sorry, she's a bit tired.
But we really appreciate it.
Can you go?
Wow!
That's so beautiful.
I don't think we'll be staying
in the same room, somehow.
Really?
?f they offer you tea,
just say no.
Hello.
Mum, this is Mary.
Mary! Hi.
Good Lord, you're pretty.
No, it's just
I've got a lot of
mascara and lipstick on.
Let's have a look.
Yes. Good.
?t's very bad for
a girl to be too pretty.
?t stops her developing a sense of humour.
Or a personality.


                                 Page 35/61

Tea?
I'd love a cup of tea.
Christ,
that's the whole day gone.
She's a very special guest.
Cup without the crack.
Skipping stones.
They've been doing this
since he was about this high.
And what are your faults?
I mean, little weaknesses.
I...
Well, I'm very insecure.
Sweet.
Okay. I've a very
bad temper sometimes.
Crucial. How else are you gonna
get a fella to
do what you want?
And, of course, I have...
I have a weakness for your son.
So do I.
But best not to tell him.
Don't want him getting cocky.
Pow!
I'm so good
without the ball. Pow!
What do you think of her?
I like her more
than you already.
Look, I'd forgotten this.
Jimmy Fontana Il Mondo.
Greatest record ever
recorded by an ltalian
who looks like he's got a
dead badger on his head.
And you've got the album.
Yes!
Check out those specs!
Come on, on with the game!
Right.
And what an extraordinary
game this is.
For the first time


                                  Page 36/61

a father and son
are playing each other
in the World Table
Tennis Final and
neither of them are Chinese.
Tremendous play from the old
World Champion and his son,
the first openly ginger
British table tennis player
but there are signs the
youngster's beginning to crack.
There are tears in his eyes.
There are not!
There soon will be!
Hey.
Hey!
I didn't know you were here.
Yeah. I just
popped down for a while.
Okay.
What about the job?
So how long have you been here?
Couple of weeks.
Gosh! So, life in London...
Horrid.
Okay.
Is Mary here?
Yes.
Where? Downstairs.
You be gentle.
Be gentle!
Careful!
Yeah, nice to see you, too. I'm
trying to make a good impression...
Yeah, you make a good impression.
Right, sorry. Sorry.
I've got an important
announcement to make.
Exciting.
We've decided, after a little
bit of thought, to get married.
That's wonderful news.
Who are you getting married to?
To Mary. Over there.


                                 Page 37/61

Thank God for that.
Jolly embarrassing if it had
been another girl. imagine that.
We're so pleased.
No, sorry. Yeah.
By the way, the wedding
will be quite soon
because we're
having a baby, too.
You're pregnant?
Yes.
Who's the father?
Well, Tim, I hope.
Thank God for that. Jolly awkward
if it had been another fellow.
We have to decide tonight.
What? Everything.
The only thing
you've decided about our
wedding is that I'm
coming down the aisle
to the sound of
some ltalian weirdo
singing a song called Il Mondo.
Excellent song.
To which I've said
a definitive ?'no.?'
So here's the deal.
I will take off one item of clothing
for every decision you make.
Okay. You have my attention,
young lady.
Right, um,
where would you
like to get married?
Home. I'd hate anywhere else.
Okay.
My God. Good.
Who should the priest be?
?t'll have to be
the local bloke
with yellow teeth and
the massive unibrow.
Okay.


                                 Page 38/61

That's a lock for Hagrid.
Um...
Best Man?
Damn.
Best Man. Now.
No, this is so hard. It's lose-lose you know
You piss off all the
ones you don't pick, and you end
up hating the one you do pick
because he makes a bad
speech and ruins the day.
Do you wanna see
these puppies or not?
Yes, I do.
Jay. it's your choice.
He's my best friend,
but he's a moron.
Yeah, he will
mess up everything.
Rory. Sure?
No, Harry.
Harry it is. Let's do this.
Rory. Sorry.
What? That's such a cheat.
Okay, fine.
Honeymoon?
Bed and breakfast in Scotland.
I am not taking
my pants off for Scotland.
But it's all we can afford.
Take off your pants.
I will not.
Take off your pants!
I want
two weeks in Bali!
Take off those pants!
Have you planned a break? No.
No! Is that you? ?t wasn't me.
?t's for you.
No, I'm caught!
I've got it. I've got it!
Help me!
Yes!
Right, follow me!


                                 Page 39/61

My gosh!
My God!
God!
it's a joke!
Here.
Yes, come on.
This way.
My God!
Hello,
I'm Rory.
When Tim asked me to
be his Best Man, I was terrified.
So I thought best
thing is to find
a book about speeches.
And here it is.
And it says think of
really funny anecdotes.
And there is a very hilarious
story, actually from work.
?t was quite a complicated
case based on an issue of
cross-amortisation
of ownership of
post-divorce
properties and, um...
Let me just explain the context.
The Defendant...
When Tim asked me
to do his Best Man speech,
my immediate reaction was,
?'How much are you gonna
pay me, you little shit?
?'l don't write
for free, you know.?'
These were the girls available
to him at that time.
?'Hello, girls.?' And this is how
far he got with each of them.
Let me explain the code.
5, blow job.
8, full penetrative...
and so a toast
to the man with


                                    Page 40/61

the worst haircut
but the best bride in the room.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tim and Mary.
Tim and Mary.
That's us.
I wish I'd said ?'l love you.?'
You did, Dad.
?t was implied.
I'm not sure ?'implied?' is good
enough for a wedding day, are you?
No, don't do it, it's fine.
I'm so happy with it as it was.
You really don't have to.
I'll do what
I wanna do, young man.
Will you excuse me
for just one moment?
later on I may tell you about
Tim's many failings as a man
and as a table tennis player.
But,
important first to say the one
big thing, I've only loved
three men in my life.
My dad was
a frosty bugger so that
only leaves dear Uncle Desmond,
B. B. King, obviously,
and this young man here.
I'd only give one piece of
advice to anyone marrying.
We're all quite
similar in the end.
We all get old and tell the
same tales too many times.
But try and marry someone
kind.
And this is a kind man
with a good heart.
I'm not particularly proud
of many things in my life,
but I am very proud
to be the father of my son.


                                 Page 41/61

I'm so sorry to disturb you, but I
wonder if I could have your autograph.
No. No.
I'm at a wedding,
for God's sake.
I'm here to
celebrate true love not
scribble my illegible
signature on stupid
bits of paper that
you can flog on eBay
so that at the next wedding you
can wear a less hideous hat.
I see you've met my Aunt May.
God. People should
wear name tags.
You next, Kittle Kattle.
I don't know, Uncle D.
Boys aren't very nice.
Aren't they, darling?
Not in my experience.
They're always
taking liberties,
not giving much back in return.
?t's yummy. Yeah?
I like the way you say 'yummy.'
Do you wish we'd picked
another less wet day?
No.
Not for the world.
And so it begins.
Lots and lots of types of days.
Fun!
Posy.
Posy she is.
The most beautiful
girl in the world.
You want your daddy.
Yes, I know.
Yeah.
No one can ever
prepare you for
what happens when
you have a child.


                                 Page 42/61

When you see
the baby in your arms
and you know that
it's your job now.
No one can prepare you for
the love and the fear.
She's lovely.
You were such an ugly baby.
More chimpanzee than child.
I remember
the first time I saw you,
I thanked God we were in driving
distance of London Zoo.
Come on, hand over
the little bugger,
let's see if she bounces.
Yeah,
she definitely will bounce.
Look.
She can do anything.
Look. Hello.
Sweetheart.
No one can prepare you
for the love
people you love
can feel for them.
And nothing can prepare you for
the indifference of friends
who don't have babies.
Do you wanna
go to Uncle Jay?
No, thanks, it's fine.
It's great.
And it's a shock how
quickly you have to move
to a new place you
completely can't afford.
Look what we found.
Look who it is!
Honey!
Sorry.
Suddenly, time travel seems
almost unnecessary,
because every detail of


                                   Page 43/61

life is so delightful.
What's his name?
Horace, I think.
Of course it is.
Only one important thing
for a godfather, I'm told,
never bring a present
smaller than the child.
Shut up, you smug bastard.
Don't worry, I didn't
bring anything at all.
She'll never know.
Hasn't got a brain yet.
I didn't expect to
see you here, Harry.
Children's party's
not exactly your style.
No, Mary, I was tricked. I was
told there would be free booze.
I hate kids, as you know.
Where's Kit Kat, by the way?
I don't know, she said
she'd be here around 3:00.
And you know we got purple
cupcakes for her especially.
Here she is!
Speak of the devil,
that will be her.
We'll wait till
Aunty Kit Kat gets here.
Hey. Jimmy.
Where's my sister?
Thought she was here.
No, she hasn't arrived.
That's not good.
What does that mean?
Um... We had an
argument this morning.
Over nothing, but
she'd been drinking, so...
And then she ran out to get
the car to come here and
I told her to
meet me here so...


                                  Page 44/61

There's a song by Baz
Luhrmann called Sunscreen.
He says worrying
about the future
is as effective
as trying to solve
an algebra equation
by chewing bubble gum.
The real troubles in your life
will always be things that never
crossed your worried mind.
What happened?
We had a fight.
And,
maybe I wasn't
completely sober.
How is she? Not good.
When did she leave you?
From where?
I want it exact.
Exact time. Exact address.
Here we are. Sorry, sorry.
Come on.
God.
Hi. There she is.
Does a small baby live here?
Yes, and she's so excited.
She's downstairs.
Happy birthday, Posy.
I'm sorry.
I had to pick up Kit Kat.
I thought she was
gonna drive herself.
Turns out she couldn't.
She okay? Later.
I'm worried about Kit Kat.
Yeah. I know.
She was drinking wine
while we were drinking tea.
And Jimmy wasn't nice to her.
And she spurned
the purple cupcakes.
We have to do
something to fix it.


                                   Page 45/61

Yeah.
But, you know,
if it's gonna be fixed, I think she
probably has to do it herself.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
My darling. What's happened?
You're the best
person in the world.
You're top equal with
my wife. I don't get it.
Maybe, just maybe,
I'm the faller.
Every family has,
like, someone who falls,
who doesn't make the grade,
who stumbles,
who life trips up.
Maybe I'm our faller.
No.
Okay. I'm gonna
tell you a secret.
And you have to
promise to keep it.
We've always kept secrets.
We have?
You promise you
won't ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever tell?
Yes.
I can travel in time.
Why are we standing in the
cupboard under the stairs?
Because we're gonna go back in time and
you're gonna do some things differently.
I love it when you're funny.
Grab my hand. Close your eyes.
My God! My God!
My arsing God in a box.
You're kidding?
I can go anywhere in time and you bring
me back to the worst party of all time.
'Fraid so. Let's go.


                                 Page 46/61

We've got work to do.
What work?
Making sure you do
not meet Jimmy Kincade.
Quick, in here.
But he's about to
fall in love with me!
Not this time he isn't.
Who's the pretty looking girl?
It's Jennifer, isn't it?
Yeah.
Wild!
I like your skirt, Jennifer.
Thank you.
Right, I get it.
?f he hadn't met me, he would have
just had sex with someone else.
Nip it in the bud?
Excuse me, Jimmy.
Sorry. Do I know you?
Yeah, you do.
Very well. Sorry.
And this is what I should
have done right at the start.
Happy New Year, everybody.
Happy New Year.
And back to the cupboard.
Amazing!
What happens now?
God knows.
What I'm hoping is that from
this moment on you avoid
the sleazy bad guys because
they're sleazy and bad.
When did you get so serious?
Since it occurred to me
that I might lose you.
Brace yourself,
this could be weird.
Things will have changed.
My God.
What?
Jay.
Jay Jay? Yes.


                                 Page 47/61

And he's adorable. My God.
Right,
let's do this.
Come on, you two.
Mum's just cracked open
a packet of biscuits.
I've got
something in mind for you.
I know
what you're gonna say.
Have a biscuit and
come and help me.
But leave the rest for Uncle D.
?t's just tidying really.
You all right? I missed you.
Yeah.
Your mum wants me to do
some gardening. Okay.
it's tidying up, it's
all a bit out of control.
Anything that looks dead, out.
This is what we're looking for.
Okay? All this.
Dead stuff. See this.
They've torn them
to shreds, haven't they?
How did everything go?
Immensely satisfactory.
I'm so happy. I wanna
hear all about it.
Will you do dinner for us
because there's something
I have to do before

6:
Yeah. I can't think of
anything I'd love to do more.
Okay, where is the most
fabulous person in the world?
Come to your dad and get mashed
up food shoved into your mouth!
Hello there, little boy.
You just
wait there and I'll


                                  Page 48/61

be back in a minute.
Dad, can I have a quick word?
Yeah. Sure.
I can't go back past
the birth again, can I?
No. I should have
mentioned that.
You're okay till it
comes out but the exact
sperm at the exact
moment got you this
particular baby,
so if you do anything
the tiniest bit
different, you'll
have a different child.
So, every day up 'til yesterday
is as it will always be? Lost?
Just like for everyone else.
Okay. interesting.
Tough. I love you, Dad.
I've gotta go.
No.
We're not leaving
this room until we find
a way of making sure
this never happens again.
Will you go now?
I have to leave Jimmy, don't I?
For good.
And I have to stop drinking.
And stop leaving jobs.
And I have to
go out with someone
nice and boring.
Yay.
And, you know, nice
isn't necessarily boring.
Like who?
Matt Damon?
Okay.
I'll go out with Matt Damon.
Tell me,
have you seen Jay recently?


                                  Page 49/61

Your Jay? What, sticky-up hair Jay?
Looks a bit like a muppet Jay?
Yes.
He just popped into my head.
He's always had a crush on you.
Really? Yeah.
Weird!
Thinking of asking him to dinner.
Are you free?
Might be. Might have to
freshen up a bit first.
Yeah. You look shit.
Joanna.
Thank Christ you're back.
?t's been a total nightmare.
I know. it's all fine anyway.
Where is she?
it was the single worst night of my life.
Where's Posy?
There she is! Hello!
Hello! Hello.
Darling, how are you doing?
Let's have another one.
Screw that. No.
That hurt and I got fat.
Like fat-fat.
Got a little
bit fat, didn't she.
Tell Mummy you want a sister.
No. Tell Daddy you're happy
being an only child.
Fortunately we are
young and careless and
it wasn't long before
there were four of us.
And this is incredible. Posy
Lake, only 3 years old,
is about to break the women's
10 metre Olympic record.
They're gonna do it. And here they
are, they've done it! Fantastic.
That was brilliant.
You're so good.
Sleeping right


                                 Page 50/61

through all that.
Can you help me?
I'm so nervous.
What do I wear for dinner
with our bestselling author?
Let me finish up with the
monsters and I'll come right up.
Great. Thank you.
Go again.
Okay. How about this?
That's gorgeous.
Job done. Yeah.
No. Take it seriously. it's...
I don't know. No, I hate it.
Yeah. it's boring and
makes me look kind of lumpy.
No, you're right. it is boring and lumpy.
I hate it.
Okay. What about this?
Gorgeous. We did it.
No, it's too breasty.
Is it? Okay.
?t's not too breasty.
No. I'm not wearing these heels.
I look like a prostitute.
Not high heels, then.
But then we have
the short legs problem.
Well, do you want to look
like a prostitute or a dwarf?
Warning. That's a warning.
Yes!
No.
No!
Now that I like.
No, I'm just
picking up the dress
that this goes under.
Such a bad boy.
This one?
Not bad.
Or this one?
?t's a trick question, isn't it?
Same dress. No!


                                 Page 51/61

No?
Okay. I don't think
this one's too bad.
Yeah, it's fabulous.
Really? Yeah.
Okay. Great. Good.
Um...
How about the blue one?
The blue one? Yeah.
The first one that you tried
on that was boring and lumpy,
but that wasn't actually
boring and lumpy, that one?
Yeah, which do you prefer?
I don't know. I'm actually
starting to go mad.
I think I like the blue one.
Okay. Yeah.
Okay. Okay, let's go
with this one, then?
You look amazing.
Really? Yes.
Okay, thanks.
God.
Where's Posy?
I left her downstairs.
Not leaving the door open to the
room with the manuscript in it?
I don't think so.
Look at me. Look me in
And talk me through this.
Basically my life is over.
I really need to go out for just
like two minutes, maybe one.
Don't you dare!
Don't you dare answer that!
What am I gonna do?
I think that we should
really answer the phone.
?f you answer
the goddamn phone,
I will kill you with the phone.
I won't answer the phone,
but I do need to get out.


                                   Page 52/61

No, no getting out,
no getting out. No.
Okay, right.
Sorry, Mr McEwan.
We read most of your book but,
you see, the rest of it was
coloured on or shredded.
Yeah.
I had no idea Posy
actually knew how to use
that machine.
In a way that's impressive.
What is it? How can I help you?
Mary.
No, everything... Sorry.
Your son will explain.
?t's your mother.
Hi, Mum.
No, no, it's okay. We'll...
We'll come straight down.
Okay, bye.
Hello, darling.
Mum. How are you?
Honestly?
Why not?
I am fucking furious.
I am so uninterested in
a life without your father.
Mary. Come on,
let's make some tea.
How are you?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Did you eat?
Yes, of course.
Desmond.
How are you?
I'm very well, thanks.
Though a little hot.
Your father,
I think, is not so well.
Cancer.
Yes.
I'm very unhappy about it, Tim.
At your wedding


                                  Page 53/61

he said he loved me.
He does. I know.
That was
the best day of my life.
So this is probably the worst.
Dad.
For God's sake.
Not you, too.
What?
Well, Kit Kat's just rolled up blubbing
her eyes out and now you're here.
What's Mum been saying?
The truth.
Yeah, well,
apart from that?
?t may have been the
smoking but I couldn't
undo that as it was
before you were all born.
And anyway, your mother definitely
wouldn't have gone out with me
if I hadn't been
such a sexy smoker.
I did get diagnosed as soon as
possible, but it was too late.
How long have we got?
You know, it, it could be years.
How long really?
Weeks, I'm afraid.
Have we had this
conversation before?
Yeah.
What happened?
I rather let myself down.
I hugged you.
Sorry.
I think I just thought
with the time thing...
No, I never said
we could fix things.
I specifically never said that.
Life's a mixed bag,
no matter who you are.
Look at Jesus.


                                 Page 54/61

He was the Son of God,
for God's sake, and look
how that turned out.
I know, but
you must see
I feel a bit cheated.
Don't. In fact,
feel the opposite.
The only people who
give up work at 50
are the time travellers
with cancer who want
to play more table tennis
with their sons.
Right.
So that's been the deal?
I'm sorry we had to call.
It's suddenly got very bad.
And I have something very
important to tell you.
Or, let me check,
do you want to
know the big secret,
or would you rather find it
out for yourself like I did?
Christ,
there's another secret?
Less dramatic.
Much more important.
The real mothership.
No, go on. Tell me.
Let's save some time.
And so he told me his
secret formula for happiness.
Part one of the two part plan
was that I should just get on
with ordinary life,
living it day by day,
like anyone else.
This is our current statement with a
revised paragraph there, highlighted.
Rupert. Rupert, is that
the best you can do?
No. Absolutely not.


                                 Page 55/61

We can change that.
ltem number two.
Good afternoon, sir. Are you
eating in or taking away today?
Take away, please.
Yeah? No problem.
Lovely, that's 4.24 then, please, sir.
Thank you kindly.
Lovely. And there's your change, sir.
76 pence change.
Thanks. Thank you. Hello there.
Are you eating in
or taking away?
Do you find the Defendant, John
Welbeck, guilty or not guilty of fraud?
Not guilty.
And that is the verdict of you all? Yes.
Thank you. You may be seated.
Thank God.
Let the Defendant
be discharged.
Be upstanding in court.
Lights out? Yeah.
Tough day.
But then came
part two of Dad's plan.
He told me to live every day
again almost exactly the same.
The first time with all the
tensions and worries that
stop us noticing how
sweet the world can be,
but the second time noticing.
Okay, Dad.
Let's give it a go.
What's our statement
at the moment?
This is it with the revised...
Robert, this does not pass.
Is this the best you can do?
I'll leave you two
to thrash this out.
Ooh.
Good afternoon, sir.


                                 Page 56/61

Good afternoon.
Are you eating in or taking away today?
Take away, please.
Would you like a bag?
That's fine.
Lovely. That's 6.23 then, please.
And enjoy the rest of your day.
Thank you. Bye-bye.
Hello, there.
Look around you! What?
?sn't this room beautiful?
Yeah.
Come on.
Not guilty.
Fantastic!
So not such
a bad day after all?
No. it was pretty good really.
Very good day, actually,
as it turns out.
Well, that's a relief,
because if it had
been a very bad day,
I thought I might have had to have
had sex with you to make up for it.
Goodnight.
?t was a very, very bad day.
?t went very, very badly.
I got fired from my job.
And then I killed a man.
That is a very bad day.
?t's terrible. Yeah.
Like the worst day ever.
So sorry.
Some days, of course, though,
you only want to go through once.
You okay?
Right, are we ready for this?
'Course we're not. Hateful day.
Just give me one minute.
This is so brilliant.
Dickens is so good on
actual jokes, actual gags.
Where have you come from?


                                 Page 57/61

?t's the...
Okay.
Big day.
Thanks for dropping in.
How's Uncle Desmond's suit?
?mmaculate.
Excellent.
Did I mention I wanted
the Nick Cave track?
?t's taken care of.
Thank you.
Can I just read
you this one bit?
Read away,
I've got lots of time.
?'l think the Romans
must have aggravated
?'one another very
much with their noses.
?'Perhaps they became the restless
people they were in consequence.
?'Anyhow, Mr Wopsle's Roman
nose so aggravated me...?'
What do you
think about the kids?
What about them?
Not many of them, are there?
What?
Well, I mean two?
?t's more than
the Chinese are allowed.
I just thought
that maybe, you know,
it was time for
the insurance baby.
What?
In case one of them
is really smart,
we don't want the other one to
feel stupid their whole life.
And if we had a third one, then
we could have two happy dummies.
What do you think?
It was the toughest


                                 Page 58/61

decision of my life.
Saying 'yes' to
the future meant
saying 'goodbye'
to my dad. Forever.
Why don't we wait a bit?
Absolutely.
You're right. Yeah.
How about now?
Or now?
Now?
Yeah,
okay.
Really?
Dad always wished
there had been more of us.
So...
Anyway, we might try
and nothing happens.
Exactly.
Really could be tonight.
And you cannot believe
the detail in which
I know the route
to the hospital.
Yay.
Will you excuse me for a sec?
Just have to go downstairs.
and it's 17-20 in
this incredibly tight contest
being played by
the two most physically
perfect players in
the history of the game.
The crowd, enchanted by the
younger player, are seduced
by memories of the older
player's illustrious past.
My God, I've won.
I haven't won in years.
You finally got good.
What's my prize? Apart from the
Olympic gold medal, of course.
A kiss will have to do.


                                  Page 59/61

A kiss?
I get you.
This is it, then?
This is it.
?t's my last bit of extra time.
The baby is
completely on the way.
Congratulations.
My son.
My dad.
Is there anything
at all I can do?
Is there anything
you want to do?
I don't know. There is this
one thing.
A quick little walk.
Totally against the rules,
of course,
but if we don't change a thing,
if we're very careful,
it shouldn't do any harm.
?t would be nice.
I'm really trying.
I'm really trying.
Get down low.
Total defeat.
I'm tired.
Thanks, Dad.
So I'm almost
up-to-date with my story.
As all families do, we got
used to life after death.
And it was still fine.
And things settled back into their
traditional rhythms season after season,
and are much as
they have always been.
And we've got used to
Kit Kat being happy again.
And then we got used
to her being a mum.
Albeit not a very
good or even safe one.


                                 Page 60/61

And in the end,
I think I've learned the final
lesson from my travels in time.
And I've even gone one step
further than my father did.
Okay, I'll do the kids.
No, don't worry. I'll do them.
Yeah, you do them,
you lazy bum.
The truth is, I now
don't travel back at all.
Not even for the day.
I just try to
live every day as if
I've deliberately
come back to this one day
to enjoy it as if it
was the full final day
of my extraordinary,
ordinary life.
Hello, you're down already. That's great.
Thank you so much for that.
And in we go.
Posy? Posy!
That's fine.
We're all travelling
through time together
every day of our lives.
All we can do is do our best
to relish this remarkable ride.
Yes, yes, yes...
Okay, I'll see you then.
Bye-bye.
See you later.

Arthur
By Steve Gordon




   Page 1/44

Bitterman, stop the car!
Stop it, stop the car.
Girls! Girls!
Hello, girls!
Would the more attractive
of you please step forward?
God! That's funny!
No, actually,
you're both very attractive.
Would the one who thinks I'm
attractive please step forward?
Quickly as possible!
Time is money!
What'd you have in mind?
VD I'm really into penicillin.
Now that's funny!
Actually, what I had in mind...
...was spending the evening
with a stranger who loves me.
It's going to cost you $ 100.
Oh, yeah?
What time do you get off work?
No, I'm kidding!
Let's make it $200.
But I will ask you to Simoniz my car.
Has there been a death
in your family?
This is funny stuff here.
Let's go.
Bitterman, give her...
...give her friend $ 100.
She came in second.
Who is that guy?
I'd rather not say.
I think I know.
I saw his picture in the paper.
- That's Arthur Bach, isn't it?
- What if it is?
Is there something wrong with him?
Yes.
Permit me to introduce myself.
Where in the hell's my hat?
It's on the floor.
I hate it when that happens.


                                 Page 2/44

I am Arthur.
I'm Gloria.
- I am Arthur.
- Yeah. What're you drinking?
Scotch. Would you like some?
Why not?
You're with me and
you can ask that question?
What's so funny now?
I sometimes just
think funny things!
What do you do for a living?
I race cars. I play tennis...
...I fondle women, but...
...I have weekends off
and I am my own boss.
The Plaza, and step on it!
Sir, if I may say so...
Go through the park.
You know how I love the park!
Can I have another drink?
Isn 't this fun?!
Isn 't fun the best thing to have?!
Don 't you wish you were me?
I know I do!
Isn't that Arthur Bach?
I fell out of the goddamned car!
Is that the funniest thing ever?!
Are you hurt, sir?
I fell out of the car!
Isn't that the funniest thing ever?
You had to be there, right?
You are quite amusing, sir.
Please get my drink.
After all, we're going to the bar.
Thank you so much.
Madame, I'm sorry,
but we have absolutely no...
Don't give me any stuff, buster!
It's all right,
the lady's with me.
Mr. Bach! How good to see you!
If only someone
I knew felt that way!


                                 Page 3/44

We have your regular table,
Mr. Bach.
I know you have it,
but is anyone sitting at it?
It's all right. They're used
to seeing me with the turtle.
Uncle Peter! And Aunt Pearl!
You're looking well.
Thank you!
Aunt Pearl, may I say
you're looking younger every day.
Doesn't Aunt Pearl
look wonderful, darling?
She looks great.
We haven't had the pleasure
of meeting this young woman.
Would you introduce us?
How stupid of me!
Princess Gloria, may I
introduce my aunt and uncle...
...Peter and Pearl Bach.
How are you?
Princess? Did you say
""Princess,"" Arthur?
There's a very small country
in the West Indies. I mean small.
I see. Thank you.
It's terribly small.
Tiny little country.
Rhode Island could
beat the crap out of it in a war.
That's how small it is.
It's small.
It's very little...
It's 85 cents in a cab
from one end to the other.
I'm talking small!
We understand it's small, Arthur.
They recently had
the whole country carpeted.
This is not a big place.
We understand that it's small, Arthur.
And we also understand
that you are very drunk.


                                 Page 4/44

So why don't we meet again
when you're sober?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I can't help it.
Grow up, Arthur.
You'd make a fine adult.
That's easy for you to say.
You haven't got
...hanging in your closet!
It's the regular table!
Wait a minute...
...regular chair.
How rich are you?
All I can tell you is...
...I wish I had a dime
for every dime I have.
The service here is terrible.
Where the hell's my drink?
- We just ordered!
- That's always their excuse.
Engine room,
where the hell's my drink?!
Are you married?
There's only one woman for me.
And I can't stand her.
Her name is Susan.
I can't tell you her last name.
It would be indiscreet.
Johnson.
Susan Johnson.
My father wants me to marry her...
...but I'm not going to!
You're the only woman at this table.
Sure, you bring her a bottle,
me you bring a glass.
Fine. Thank you very much.
Aren't waiters wonderful?
You ask them for things,
and they bring them.
Same principle as Santa Claus.
Tell me about yourself.
You mean, why I'm a hooker?
Are you a hooker?
Jesus, I forgot!


                                 Page 5/44

I thought I was
doing great with you.
Why are you a hooker?
My mother died when I was six.
Son of a bitch!
Don't they know
what they do to kids?!
My father raped me when I was 12.
So you had six
relatively good years.
I'm sorry.
Listen, my father screwed me too.
Do you like me?
You're cute.
I know that!
But do you like me?
Well, Princess,
we're going to have fun!
Tonight is New Year's Eve!
Third time this week!
Here's to you!
Noisy!
Hello, darling.
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?
- Fine.
- Good.
Please stop that!
Hobson how good to see you!
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.
I've taken the liberty of
anticipating your condition...
...and I've brought you orange juice,
coffee and aspirins.
Or do you need to throw up?
Gloria, I would like you
to meet Hobson.
My best friend in the world.
I relish the compliment.
It is thrilling to meet you, Gloria.
You obviously have a wonderful
economy with words, Gloria.
I look forward to your next


                                 Page 6/44

syllable with great eagerness.
As we all can see,
it's a lovely day.
Which would seem to indicate
that the night is over.
I have arranged breakfast
for you on the east patio.
This is a robe.
Please put it on.
Say goodbye to her, Arthur.
Do you know what
I'm going to do?
No, I don't.
I'm going to take a bath.
I'll alert the media.
Do you want to
run my bath for me?
It's what I live for.
Perhaps you'd like me to
wash your dick for you...
...you little shit.
You'd better watch out
You'd better not cry
You'd better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Hobson, this is Arthur.
Yes! How delightful
to hear from you.
How about a pitcher of martinis?
No, thank you.
I'm not going
to face my father sober.
If you don't bring them
I'll have someone else do it!
I'll bring them.
- Say goodbye.
- Goodbye.
He treats me like a kid.
You know, Arthur...
...your father is going
to demand that you marry Susan.
I don't care what he demands.
Stay with me a minute, Hobson.


                                   Page 7/44

You know I hate to be alone.
Yes. Bathing is a lonely business.
Except for fish.
I beg your pardon?
Did you say ""except for fish""?
Fish all bathe together.
Although they do tend
to eat one another.
I often think...
...fish must get
awfully tired of seafood.
What are your thoughts, Hobson?
Pardon me...
I don't want you to be alone.
I'll never be alone.
I have you.
Isn't life wonderful, Hobson?
Yes, Arthur, it is.
Do your armpits.
A hot bath is wonderful!
Girls are wonderful!
Imagine how wonderful
a girl who bathes would be!
Get dressed!
I hate it here.
Of course you hate it.
People work here.
Here, read this magazine.
There are many pictures.
Look how nobody ever smiles here.
Why doesn't anybody ever smile here?
They smile at lunchtime.
Lower your voice, Arthur.
And sit up.
Stop being so nervous.
Later on, we'll get ice cream.
Your father will see you now.
Come on, Hobson.
He wants to see you alone.
He gets all that money.
Pays his family back
by being a stinking drunk.
It's enough to make you sick.
I really wouldn't know, sir.


                                 Page 8/44

I'm just a servant.
On the other hand...
...go screw yourself.
The press has a good time
with you, Arthur.
""Millionaire Drunk Playboy. ""
You're the weakest man
I've ever known!
I despise your weakness!
I'm afraid we have to talk.
I'm not going to marry her!
I've told you a thousand times!
Fine. If that's your decision,
the family has no choice.
I'm sorry, Arthur, very sorry.
But as of this moment, you are...
...cut off.
You mean cut off from...
...you and Grandmother
and the family?
So you mean cut off
from the...
You don't mean cut off from the...
The money, Arthur.
Your grandmother and I have had
all the papers drawn up.
We want this marriage, Arthur.
I want it. Burt Johnson wants it.
Burt Johnson!
He's a criminal!
We all are, Arthur.
And as you know...
...we usually get what we want.
Frankly, Father,
I'd rather starve.
And I will.
I'll get married when
I fall in love.
Fine. I respect your integrity.
You've just lost
Actually, Susan is
a very nice girl.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yes, wonderful.


                                 Page 9/44

Have you ever seen her face...
...when the light
catches it just right?
She's really quite beautiful.
Of course, you can't depend
on that light.
The wedding is a month from today.
The invitations will be
mailed tonight.
Ever taste her chicken?
She does spectacular
things with a chicken.
And I love a chicken made at home.
This is the ring your grandfather
gave to your grandmother.
She wants you to
give it to Susan.
This is to marry one girl?
Don't do this to me.
I've been waiting for you
to grow up. I can't wait any longer.
Congratulations, Father, you win.
I had every intention of winning.
Congratulations to you, Arthur.
You're going to be wealthy
for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
I'll take three dozen of these shirts.
Assorted colors.
I hate my father.
Then purchase four dozen.
Four dozen.
And I want...
...14 of these sweaters, all green.
- All green?
- I don't wear sweaters.
Send them to
my address, will you?
What else can I buy, Hobson?
Hobson! Did you see that?!
She stole that tie!
It's a perfect crime!
Girls don't wear ties.
Although some do. It's not a perfect


                                 Page 10/44

crime, but it's a good crime.
If she murdered the tie
it'd be a perfect crime.
Why are you so happy
about all this?
The man following her
is a security guard.
We've got to be calm!
Isn't she beautiful? Jesus!
May I ask what have
we to do with this?
I beg your pardon, miss.
I'm the security guard
in the store.
You don't need the badge.
No customer would
wear that jacket.
I must look in the bag.
I saw you put something in it.
You got trouble, mister.
You'll never work on the East Coast
again. What's your name?
She's sensational!
She does have a certain
Eleanor Roosevelt quality.
What's your address?
The address, Chester!
I'm not fooling!
I saw you put a tie in that bag!
What did you say?!
All right, that's it!
I want a cop!
Get me a cop!
We need a cop here!
Don't move from where you are.
I don't want you out of my sight!
Get me a cop!
Get your hands off me.
I'm Arthur Bach.
I'll straighten this out.
Mr. Bach, you really should
stay out of this.
Well, he's in it, Chester.
Tell him, Alfred.


                                 Page 11/44

I know this woman.
We're shopping together.
Where the hell have you been?
I'm sorry darling.
I got caught up.
She's a friend, Mr. Bach?
He just said that, Chester.
You're such a schmuck.
I asked her to pick out a tie.
I was going to put it on my bill.
- You didn't pay for it?
- I forgot. I'm sorry.
Chester, what can I say?
I had no idea.
May I look at the tie?
Oh, God, that's really lovely.
- I hope you like it.
- You're really wonderful.
Not in front of
all these people, dear.
They might think you're an animal.
Mr. Bach, you understand,
it's my job.
Would you ask the lady at
the counter to put this on my bill?
I'll take care of it, Mr. Bach.
Thank you very much.
Were you scared?
Why are you smiling
at me like that?
I see.
You're a little strange...
...but cute.
How are you?
Have a nice day. Thank you very much.
I'll go to the bus stop now.
Why did you steal that tie?
I don't know.
I'm a wonderful person!
I'm serious.
I'll be with you in a minute.
He's getting on my nerves.
Will you stop smiling
at me like that?


                                 Page 12/44

You look like
one of Santa's helpers.
Is he with us?
My name is Arthur,
and this is Mr. Hobson.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon?
My name is Linda.
I'd like to thank you very much.
You did a nice thing.
That was an interesting kiss.
- You kiss your wife like that?
- I'm not married.
Keep smiling. 688-5549.
Don't expect big things
on the first date.
Yes, it's been a distinct
pleasure meeting you.
Arthur, we really must be going.
Thank you for
a memorable afternoon.
Usually one must go to a bowling alley
to meet a woman of your stature.
Wouldn't it be funny
if he called me?
Arthur, I see no reason
for prolonging this conversation.
Unless you're planning...
...to knock over a fruit stand
later in the evening.
Good luck in prison.
Who was the tie for?
A guy.
Look how he stopped smiling.
My father. It's his birthday.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
I don't know.
I have plans for tomorrow night.
What should I wear?
Steal something casual.
- I like him.
- Likewise, I'm sure.
I'll have Bitterman
drive you home.


                                 Page 13/44

You don't have to do that.
Bitterman doesn't
have to take me.
I really hardly ever
take the bus, ever.
- But it's so hard to get a cab.
- Of course.
I'm sure we know a lot
of the same people.
- Get in.
- Right.
Tell Bitterman where to take you.
And make sure...
...you give him your address
and phone number.
Take care of her, Bitterman.
Good afternoon!
You'd think they'd never
seen a car before.
Hey lady, where
did you get the car?
Could you children please
allow us our privacy?
Could I sit here until
one of my neighbors walks by?
I want someone I know
to see me get out of this.
I understand.
Here comes Mrs. Nesbit.
This should kill her.
Don't touch the door.
I'll do it.
Mrs. Nesbit deserves
the entire treatment.
Thank you, Bitterman.
Well, hello, Mrs. Nesbit!
Will that be all, madam?
I think so.
Have a nice evening, Mrs. Nesbit.
- Could be a big tie.
- It is a tie.
Then guessing would be
out of the question.
- It is a tie!


                                    Page 14/44

- Surprise!
I love it!
It goes with everything I own.
I hope you like it.
If I don't get a job soon, you may
get it back on your birthday.
Dad, shut up.
A funny thing happened
to me today.
Do you know why...
...girls marry so badly?
Is this a joke?
Are these Polish girls?
The reason is, there
are so many girls...
...and so few princes.
You met a prince?
I met a nice guy. With my help,
he could become a prince.
- Who is he?
- Just a guy.
What does he do?
Nothing.
Another beauty.
How does he make a living?
Look, I have to make dinner.
I take it this bum
will be calling you.
Dad, he's a millionaire.
You have my permission
to marry him.
Roses. Yellow.
She'll drop dead. She'll love them.
Yellow roses. Two dozen.
I think something else
would look nice too.
Red roses. With the yellow.
She won't know what hit her!
You'll be aces with her.
You're a nice boy.
Two dozen red, okay?
- Do you know what happened?
- No, I don't.
Yesterday I met her


                                 Page 15/44

outside Bergdorf's.
I can't stop
thinking about her!
Are you married?
Once. She's alive.
- What's that?
- A yucca plant.
- I'll take it.
- How many?
Four.
Where were you
when I was selling cars?
How did you know
when you fell in love?
How does anybody know?
I was on a train.
From Washington to New York.
What's that?
- A fern. You need five.
- Right!
A girl got on the train.
Skinny. She gave me a smile.
By Baltimore, I was a dead duck.
Did you whistle a lot?
I find I whistle!
I whistled.
Did you feel funny?
I feel funny.
You may have a cold.
Send all this and anything else
you can think of to this address.
Send 2 dozen roses
to your wife.
The skinny one on the train.
Here, keep the change.
You're the rich one?
The one who drinks?
How does it feel
to have all that money?
It feels great.
A dumb question.
What do you do?
I've never asked.
I'm an actress.


                                    Page 16/44

I mean, I'm studying to be one.
But I'm working as a waitress.
A lot of talented girls do that.
What's it like being a waitress?
It's fun. I mean, you know.
This guy came in and pulled out...
A guy came into the diner
and pulled out...
- He pulled out what?
- Pulled out a gun!
I love this song!
I love it too!
When do I get a turn?
Can't you see I'm going
for a new world's record?
After only 12 games,
I have 80 coupons!
I knew it would be different
spending an evening with a millionaire.
Two more and I'm 20 for 20!
That's another 35 coupons!
Could we have a little quiet here?
You nut!
Look at him with his gun.
Are you cute!
God, I missed!
Nineteen.
For 19, you get 15 coupons.
We really have to go now.
Space Invaders!
Do you want the orange one?
Enjoy it!
Now take care of it.
I already named it!
I named it after my grandmother
on my mother's side.
Arthur.
Here's a rose.
I stole it from the restaurant.
Thank you.
I've never taken care of anyone.
Everyone's always taken care of me.
But if you got sick, or anything...
...I'd take care of you.


                                 Page 17/44

Then I'll get sick.
This Vermeer just arrived today.
It's called...
...""Woman Admiring Pearls. ""
The dealer jerked me around
on the price a little.
But what the hell.
We live once.
Martha...
What's the matter, Arthur?
I can't marry Susan Johnson.
- Really?
- I met this girl!
You are a charming boy.
Unfortunately...
...every time you have an erection,
it makes the papers.
Goodness!
I sound like a dime novel.
Peanuts!
Isn't my grandson handsome, Harriet?
- Yes.
- Thank you, Harriet.
Is it wonderful to be...
...promiscuous?
At your age, Martha,
it might just be dangerous.
Who is she? This one you met.
I don't know.
She lives in Queens.
She's nobody.
But there's something
about her, Martha.
Make no mistakes.
You are too old to be poor.
You don't know how.
We are ruthless people.
Don't screw with us.
Arthur, I love you.
If you don't marry Susan
I'll cut you off without a cent.
You're a scary old broad, Martha.
And you are a delightful child.
Marry Susan and cheat


                                 Page 18/44

with the nobody from Queens.
How are you?
I got off work early.
Listen, do you like lasagna?
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank God.
I know this is last minute...
...but something came up.
I can't make it tonight.
Fine. No problem. What?
Listen, the truth is...
...I'm getting engaged tonight.
The easiest thing would be
to lie, but I like you...
Look, no sweat.
We had some laughs. Good luck...
I wanted to tell you
the other night, but I...
Don't worry about it.
I have to go. Okay? Bye.
Would you like a beer?
I'll get you a beer.
I'll be all right, sweetheart.
I just have to be
alone for a minute.
Oh, God! I can't bear it.
Come in.
Shall I get the car, Mr. Bach?
No thanks, Bitterman.
Tonight I'll drive myself.
How often does
a young man get engaged?
Where's Mr. Hobson?
Mr. Hobson was tired, sir.
He's resting.
He's been tired
quite a bit lately.
I'm sure he's fine, sir.
Will you cut it out?
I didn't mean to tell you,
but I've got a tumor.
Did the lights go off?
Just talk to me, okay?
With a tumor in my head?


                                   Page 19/44

Listen, Arthur.
There are three books...
This is important.
Take them back...
...to the library.
Don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
I've only got a cold.
Now go and get engaged.
I just told Linda
I was getting engaged.
I don't know why.
A tart like that could
save you a fortune in prostitutes.
Listen, old man.
Don't ever talk about
her that way again.
She's the best person I know!
Goddamn it,
why are you such a snob?!
I raised my voice to you.
I've never done that before.
That's quite all right.
You know, you may be growing up.
And I'm sorry for what
I said about Linda.
Do you want anything?
I want to be younger.
I'm sorry.
It's your job to be older.
- Good evening, Mr. Bach.
- Good evening, Mr. Butler.
I'm here to get engaged.
Won't you come in, sir?
How are you?
Susan! You get down here
this minute!
Miss Susan is expecting you.
She's dressing.
I will inform her you're here.
Tell her Chief Inspector Flanigan
from homicide is here.
That should get her
down in a hurry.


                                 Page 20/44

Nothing. Offer to take my coat.
You don't have a coat.
Well, offer to take my tie.
It's a little joke.
Take the rest of the week off.
You're obviously
under a lot of tension.
Would you care to wait
in the library?
Yes! The bathroom is
out of the question!
That's another little joke.
Follow me, please.
I'm a little nervous.
I'm getting engaged.
You may wait in here.
Thank you!
Is there anything you
care for while you wait?
Do you have today's Pravda?
I like to keep up with Russia.
Then fill a glass with scotch.
Are you sure you want
to be a nightclub comic?
Marty, he's pouring a drink.
I'll get back to you!
If you're going to be like that,
let's call the whole thing off!
God, these people!
I'm glad we had this time together.
You're a funny guy.
You have that trouble too?
This must be awfully
embarrassing for you.
Hello, Arthur.
Hello, Mr. Johnson.
I haven't seen you lately.
The reason you haven't
seen me is because...
...I normally pick Susan up
at her apartment in town.
And you live here.
Want a drink?
I never drink.


                                 Page 21/44

- No one in my family drinks.
- That's great!
You probably never run out
of ice your whole life.
I don't drink because drinking
affects your decision-making.
You may be right.
I can't decide.
That's just a little humor.
Where's the rest
of this moose?
Arthur, I think it's time
we got to know one another.
I do too. That's why
I had you come over today.
This is a tough room.
I don't have to tell you that.
You must have hated this moose.
Why don't you forget
the moose for a moment?!
Right.
You know...
...I didn't inherit money
like you did.
I started with nothing.
And yet...
...I was a millionaire
by the time I was 18.
Anyone stood in my way,
they got hurt.
When I was 11 years old...
...I killed a man.
When you're 11, you don't even
know there's a law against that.
Is Susan here?
I knew what I was doing.
We were poor.
He came into our house
to steal our food.
Well, he was asking for it.
I took a knife...
...and I killed him
in the kitchen.
You probably ate out that night.


                                   Page 22/44

I mean, with that man
lying in your kitchen.
- You seem to find humor in everything.
- Yes, sorry.
- Arthur!
- What?
Do you know what I consider to be
my most precious possession?
My daughter.
She is my gold.
- She is my treasure.
- She's very nice.
And I protect what's mine.
And I do it in an ugly way.
- I'm from the gutter.
- I understand. The gutter.
You seem upset.
Now, Susan loves you.
And I want you to make her happy.
You can count on it.
I insist upon you making her happy.
Listen.
What happens...
...this is just hypothetical...
...if I don't make her happy?
Which is out of the question!
But let's just say...
...I make her...
...cranky?
For cranky, I guess you'd
probably just break my ankles.
Something like that.
You'll make her happy.
I don't like your drinking.
It makes you unreasonable.
I want you to go to work.
Now, your father and I
talked about it. I want you...
...to work for me.
Is this it?
She's not happy already?
Susan loves you.
So I love you.
You'll find me a friend.


                                 Page 23/44

Don't you get it?
You can get drunk.
You can throw up.
You can forget to call me
for months.
You can't lose with me.
I know you too well.
And I'm much stronger
than you are.
I know how alone you are.
I hate how alone you are.
I've cried because
you're so alone.
Don't be afraid, Arthur.
You're never going
to be alone again.
Waiter!
I'll have another.
You want another fish?
Don't drink anymore.
You're such an asshole!
This is what I am!
Everyone who drinks
is not a poet.
Some of us drink
because we're not poets.
A real woman could
stop you from drinking.
It'd have to be a real big woman.
Will you take my hand?
That would leave you with one!
Sorry. Here's the hand.
I love you, Arthur.
Good! I have to talk
to the waiter now.
My doctor advised me to
drink 10 of these an hour.
I understand, Mr. Bach.
This is the ring my grandfather
gave to my grandmother.
Then he died.
And subsequently,
she gave it to me.
I'll always love you.


                                    Page 24/44

It's a great ring, isn't it?
It's a beautiful ring.
It's a magical night.
Do you have any objection
to naming a child Vladimir?
Even a girl?
Ask me.
Will you marry me?
Take the weekend if you want.
Congratulations!
Would you mind if I took you home?
I've got a terrible headache.
I'm sorry.
This must be the building.
I hope it's not late.
Who am I talking to?
It's me, it's me.
- What do you want?
- Oh, shit!
I'm sorry to have
disturbed you, madam.
I was looking for Linda. I hope
it's the wrong house. No offense.
My husband has a gun!
I'm sure he has, madam.
For all I know, he shot it
while you screamed.
Perry! Come over here!
This man wants to know
where Linda lives!
She lives at 14133, Apartment A,
next door.
You tell a total stranger that?
You don't know who he is.
- He looks okay.
- Right, get over here!
She's terrible! Does she
always hit you like that?
Yeah, what can I do?
Mind your business!
For God's sake, she's going
to kill you! Get in there!
Give her a shot!
It's you against her, Perry!


                                 Page 25/44

Oh, God!
It's horrible!
Horrible!
You shouldn't hear this.
God!
Perry, you're a dead man.
Pardon me.
Oh, you're a hedge.
- You must be Linda's father.
- It's kind of late.
Although I wasn't sleeping myself.
Oh, nice to meet you, Arthur.
Hi, Linda!
Can I come in?
Don't you hate Perry's wife?
Let him in.
Linda, I've missed...
Sorry, Linda.
I'm sorry.
Really.
It happens.
What's the matter with you?
Nobody knocks on a door

at 3:
You're so drunk,
you can hardly stand up.
And you're engaged!
This is a goner.
I'm going to sleep.
You come here at 3 o'clock
in the morning to say goodbye?
I have to get up and go to work
in the morning. Stop kidding around!
Will you stop kissing me!
I'm sure you're not going
to want to be a waitress...
...for the rest of your life.
I am studying to be an actress.
- You told me.
- Well, I am.
This is for you...
...your father...
...and your acting career.


                                 Page 26/44

Please take it and I'll go.
$ 100,000.
We don't need your money.
Linda, it'll help you.
Look what it's done for you.
Tell your story walking,
before I call a cop!
Get out of here!
Closet.
I know.
Want to take her for a spin, Hobson?
No, thank you, Arthur.
Mr. Bach, be sure you call me
anytime you need the track.
- Take it easy.
- Thank you.
Do you know how miserable I am?
You're miserable?
I've got all this and I'm on a salary.
ARTHUR 3
Do you know the worst part?
The worst part of being me?
I should imagine your breath.
Let me be unhappy, will you?
You know, Hobson...
...I could love somebody.
I never got to love anybody!
What do I have to live for?
I'm a failure. I'm just in the way.
Would you remove your helmet, please?
- Why?
- Please.
Thank you.
Now your goggles.
- Why?
- Please.
You spoiled little bastard!
You're a man who has everything.
But that's not enough.
You feel unloved? Welcome to
the world. Everyone is unloved!
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
And incidentally, I love you.
Marry Susan, Arthur.


                                 Page 27/44

Poor drunks do not find love.
Poor drunks have very few teeth.
They urinate outdoors.
They freeze to death in summer.
I can't bear to think
of you that way.
I need Linda, Hobson.
I see.
Well, perhaps fate
will lend a hand, Arthur.
One never knows.
Good afternoon?
May I come in?
If you and your undershirt
would walk two paces backwards...
...I could enter this dwelling.
How revolting.
Look who's here.
The British Tonto.
How are you? How's Arthur?
Ever since I met Arthur,
I liked him.
We have to make sure these
two wonderful kids stay together.
Who is this person?
- He's my father.
- Yes, and I'd like to say that...
Try not to speak.
Would you get me a cup of tea?
I wish to speak to Linda.
Sure.
There is an engagement
party tonight...
...at Arthur's father's house
in Southampton.
Here is the address.
Perhaps you should attend.
Are all the ones
he passed up coming?
Young woman, this is a tie
you cannot steal!
This is a tie you'll have
to work for.
Are you inviting me


                                 Page 28/44

to Arthur's engagement party?
This is not an invitation.
However...
...if there's one thing that
old gentlemen can still do...
...they can still spot
young gentlemen in love.
Please go to the party.
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.
Does Arthur know you're here?
No, Arthur is far too fine
a person to be involved...
...in something as devious as this.
You really look out for him,
don't you?
And it is a job
that I recommend highly.
I have something for you.
For me?
What is it?
If I told you,
it would spoil the surprise.
Don't open it.
Here's your tea.
I despise tea.
Would you bring me 2 aspirin
from the bathroom?
You'll find them on the top shelf,
behind the untouched shaving cream.
That sounds bad.
Have you seen a doctor?
Yes.
And he has seen me.
You know...
...I think Arthur has
a very good friend.
May I kiss you on the cheek?
Is it something you feel
strongly about?
What about your aspirins?
The aspirins are for you, my dear.
Hello.
Good evening.


                                 Page 29/44

God knows when I'll see you again.
Arthur, will you play
something for us?
- Don't you hate these things?
- Despise them.
Actually, seriously...
...songs come and go.
But I love the classics.
And I hope you'll enjoy this one.
You'd better watch out
You'd better not cry
Are you good friends with Arthur?
For ages.
I'm so pleased he finally found
the right woman. Where is she?
Over there.
Isn't she just beautiful?
Of course she is.
Why would Arthur marry a dog?
Pardon?
Santa Claus is coming to town
How does it feel to be
getting married?
Blue Moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Thanks a lot. That's flattering.
If you knew Susan
like I knew Susan
I need a drink!
- Tell me your entire name, darling.
- Preston Langly.
Really! If you don't remember
when we met, I mean, honestly!
- Put your arm around me.
- Of course.
Linda, you're here.
So true.
Join us.
Congratulations.
Father sends his regards.
- Does he?
- Yes, he does.
Wednesday night may be


                                 Page 30/44

difficult for me.
- What?
- You're looking wonderful, my dear.
- Aren't I? Thank you.
- Wednesday?
It's difficult for her
that night, Preston.
Isn't that the night you usually
attend the ballet, darling?
Actually, I feel foolish,
but I don't recall ever making...
Would you be divine and
get me a gin and tonic?
Scotch for me, Preston.
- You wait here for me?
- If it takes forever.
What are you doing here...
...and why are you talking like that?
I was in the neighborhood.
It took me two buses,
three cabs and a train...
...to get into the neighborhood.
But what the hell?
Nice place. I like a living room
you can land a plane in.
There's more of it. You like a tour?
I've seen bedrooms.
Don't be a lover. Be a person.
Make me happy.
Her name is Linda Marolla.
She's the one Arthur saw
the other night. She lives in Queens.
Mario, please!
Don't worry. I talked to the warden.
We'll get you out of here.
When I was a kid, I used to open
their stalls and let them run out.
You should have been there
the day I freed my goldfish.
Come over here.
I want you two to meet.
Pancho, this is Linda.
I told you about her, remember?
It must have been something,


                                 Page 31/44

growing up with all this.
I was away at boarding school
most of the time.
I was kicked out of ten prep schools.
I was a bad kid.
No, you weren't.
You just wanted to go home.
Bad kids don't grow up
as nice as you.
- Why do you think Pancho loves you?
- Thank you.
This is kind of like prom night,
isn't it?
I mean, we're all dressed up.
Have you ever been in love?
You?
But when I was little,
I thought the moon followed me.
What?
I would walk and I thought
the moon went anyplace I did.
That's great!
I know it's silly,
but I was only eight years old.
I thought it meant something special
would happen to me someday.
So I've been waiting. Every day I've
been doing my hair, and washing...
...my face...
- Can I kiss you?
Please.
I wasn't talking to you.
Why is it you can make me laugh
at the saddest times in my life?
I'm funny, that's why.
I'm funny!
Yeah, that's it.
You're going to marry Susan.
I'm still glad I came here.
Made a fool out of myself.
I wish we had made love.
I'd give anything
to see you in the morning.
I have to marry Susan.


                                 Page 32/44

If I don't, my family will cut me off.
It's almost a billion dollars.
One of the horses just fainted.
Look, this is ridiculous.
You got cab fare to the city?
I don't like the train at night.
Look, when Susan and I
get married...
...I can set you up in an apartment
and we can...
Forget it.
Are you cute!
I thought I'd find you here.
He just loves that smelly old horse.
Have we met?
I don't think you have.
Linda Marolla,
this is Susan Johnson, my fiancee.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
I'd say that if I were you.
We might as well tell her.
You tell her.
My husband, Harold,
went to prep school with Arthur.
Harold lost a fortune gambling.
He's sick!
He's a sick man!
But he's my husband.
I'm not one of your guests.
I came for one reason.
I came here to beg Arthur
to lend us some money.
One of my kids...
...my youngest, my baby...
...needs an operation.
Harold hasn't kept up the insurance.
I don't know where to turn!
Do I have to go on?
No, of course not!
Of course not!
- Arthur, I wasn't spying on you.
- I know that!
There's an urgent phone call
for you from Bitterman.


                                 Page 33/44

Thank you.
Say hello to Harold for me.
You all right, Bitterman?
Yes, sir.
Would you like me to get you
some Scotch, sir?
We'll get through this together.
It's very hard.
I'm glad to have you here, sir.
Bitterman, do me a favor.
Go back to the house.
Phone my father and Mr. Johnson and
Miss Susan. Tell them what's happened.
The wedding will have to wait.
And bring me back some clothes here.
Okay, let's open the presents.
I'm sorry, Arthur.
- For what?
- For leaving you.
You're not leaving anyone.
Why, it's a basketball!
What the hell?
I knew you didn't have one.
If I feel the urge to dribble...
...I can always call the nurse.
I'll put this over here.
You purchased a choo-choo?
Look, the wheels go round.
I'm very pleased.
Do you remember...
...when you used to play
hide-and-seek with me?
I used to hide and
you never found me!
- Did you know I never looked?
- Come on!
Well, I looked a little.
One for you, one for me.
Put it on.
I don't wish to put it on.
I'll put it on.
If I begin to die,
please take this off my head.
This isn't how


                                 Page 34/44

I wish to be remembered.
Aren't they great?
I've got guns and
holsters too. Look.
Just in town for supplies, partner.
Arthur, I'm frightened.
I know you're frightened.
I'm going to take care of you.
Good morning, Mr. Bach.
Hi, Ken.
Here, I'll take that.
You look terrible.
You haven't slept in a week.
Well, we had a bad night.
He was up.
I got the kippers and eggs.
I'll get fired.
No, you won't.
Listen.
For lunch...
...I want the trout almondine
from Lutece. Tell Henri it's for me.
He shouldn't eat that.
I don't want his last meal
to be Jell-O.
Thanks very much. See you later.
Look who's up.
We have eggs, we have kippers.
We have croissants.
We have a yellow rose.
We have strawberries.
We have blueberry cakes.
We have orange juice
and great coffee.
Right. Table for one, sir.
Your regular.
You know, Arthur...
...I'm very glad you're here.
I want you to eat this.
This is costing me.
I've got chefs working at six
in the morning all over town.
You look awful.
That's because you've never


                                 Page 35/44

seen me sober. Now eat.
Come on. You used to make me eat.
It's not so bad.
You don't need to be
so frightened about it.
- What?
- Dying.
Seems natural.
Even comforting, now.
You're even teaching me
how to die?
I'm through teaching you anything.
You've grown up.
You can do anything
with your life that you want to.
What do you mean?
Figure it out.
You seen Linda Marolla lately?
Linda Marolla?
Why would you ask about her?
I don't know what I'm talking about.
I'm dying.
Want me to read you Shakespeare?
Hamlet was in big trouble
when we left off.
No.
You're a good son.
You take your average kid today.
He don't want to go in the army.
Yeah, what does he care? Dope!
But the Communists,
they go in the army!
If only we had some Communists here.
No.
While our kids are dancing...
...their kids are learning
how to fight!
Everybody's dancing here!
You're right. You're right.
It's not worth talking about.
- Let me buy you another drink.
- Right.
What do you do?
I'm a dance instructor.


                                 Page 36/44

No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding!
Honest to God.
I'm a dentist.
I hate dentists.
We're not bad guys.
It's not easy, you know.
There's teeth and gums and blood!
Oh, my God!
I have to get looped
just to walk into my office.
Bartender!
We would like two more, please.
- Haven't you had enough?
- I want more than enough.
How come you got all this
money for all these drinks?
I saved my money.
I haven't had a drink in a month.
Oh, my God!
Well, you see, my father died.
So I stayed sober.
One night at the hospital...
...he fell asleep.
I was watching him.
And then...
...he just kept on sleeping.
And I was all alone.
Oh, that's terrible.
Listen...
...I was lucky to know him at all.
Are you somebody's father?
No, I'm a drunk.
I have a brother
who moved to New Jersey.
I'm getting married soon.
Great!
I don't love her.
I don't love her!
Well, don't make a scene!
No, I'm sorry, but there's...
...this other girl.
She steals ties...
...and gives them to her father.
She's funny.


                                 Page 37/44

I want her.
I want her!
I have to go.
Sorry.
Sir, your wedding is within
less than five hours.
Listen.
Go see your brother.
All right?
Nobody should be alone.
It's awful...
...to be alone.
I want you to know, if he doesn't
show up for this wedding...
...I'll kill him.
Don't worry about it, Burt.
I talk to Arthur every day.
Since Hobson's death, he's stopped
drinking. He's anxious to work.
He's become a responsible citizen.
He'll be a good husband.
Thanks very much.
Have a nice day.
- Where's my roll?
- We're having it monogrammed.
Hurry up with the old man's roll!
Can I help you?
Do you recommend the French toast?
With all of my heart.
Lady, I got customers.
I'll have it.
You've made the right decision.
Wait a minute! Wait!
I've waited long enough.
Can you take the next
I'll have to ask.
- You want some coffee?
- Where's my roll?
Wait! I'll get it!
- What the hell's going on?
- She's getting your roll.
Here's your roll.
Arthur, what happened?
Hobson died.


                                 Page 38/44

I know.
He loved you very much.
Did you know that?
And I think I'll grow up.
I want to marry you.
Although I'm supposed
to marry Susan in 20 minutes.
- He's drunk, but he sounds sincere.
- Eat your roll!
The money.
Can you live without the money?
Well, we'll have to.
Please marry me.
I'll try to be sober
and to make you happy.
Although it won't be easy,
because I'll be poor.
We'll be poor.
We'll be poor.
- Most people are poor.
- Eat your roll!
Now, I have to tell Susan.
Come with me?
I got to change.
- I'll cover for you.
- All right.
Last night, I could have sworn
the moon was following me.
It was.
I'm Arthur Bach, the groom.
Congratulations!
Thank you. And to you too.
I wonder, could you tell me
where the wedding party is?
Right over there, in that room.
Thank you very much.
You've got a lovely...
...hat! Hat. It's called a hat.
Good luck, Arthur.
Thank you very much.
I'm Arthur Bach, the groom.
I'm Arthur Bach.
Did you forget your garter belt?
Sorry I'm late.


                                 Page 39/44

Susan, just the one I wanted
to talk to.
Nice dress.
- Arthur, the ceremony's just...
- Yeah, I know.
Could we just talk for a moment,
away from all these people?
Of course.
I don't love you. I don't love you.
- What is it, dear?
- I don't love you.
I don't love you!
It's right in that room over there.
Thank you.
Your hat is lovely.
I've heard.
You're drunk?
You're frightened?
I'm both of those.
I know, but I'm...
...in love with another woman.
- What, dear?
- I'm in love with another woman.
I'm in love...
...with another...
...woman!
Susan, the one innocent...
...person in all of this has been you.
I'm really sorry.
Shut up, Arthur! Just shut up!
Daddy!
Hello, Mr. Johnson!
He must be nervous.
Arthur gets nervous.
Here's your ring, Arthur.
I hope you're happy.
Now, stand up, son, I want
to kill you with my bare hands.
I think you know everyone.
This is Susan's father.
My God! Arthur, you're really hurt!
I've got him right
where I want him.
You animal!


                                 Page 40/44

Look, it's over!
He doesn't love your daughter.
I'm sorry. It happens.
He loves me.
What about Harold?
Harold?
- You poor thing.
- Stand aside.
Now, is this the slut that
you've disgraced my daughter for?!
Slut?!
Slut?!
Please, Daddy!
- Daddy, he's not worth it.
- Just sit up.
Can you move, Arthur?
Everybody out!
Out! All of you, out!
God!
He's taking the knife
out of the cheese!
Do you think he wants
some cheese?
No, I think we're going to die!
What's going on here?
Stop that this instant!
Don't screw with me, Burt!
Ladies and gentlemen...
...I'm sorry.
As you probably have surmised by now...
...there will be no wedding.
The bride...
...has had second thoughts...
...and has decided...
...not to marry me.
Most of you know me.
Can you blame her?
I won't be seeing most of you
anymore because...
...I'm going to be...
...poor.
I'll miss you.
Now there's a good...
...chance I should go...


                                 Page 41/44

...to the hospital.
This has some iodine on it,
so it might hurt a little.
That hurts, I hate it! Stop it!
- Why did you do that?
- Because I hate an infection!
If you'd have just
let me get...
Look, as long as we're here...
Do you promise to love me...
...and obey me?
And be a good boy?
I do.
And do you promise never to put
that stuff on my face again?
I do.
God!
We're going to be great!
We're going to be like...
...one of those poor couples
on the subway who hold hands.
How much is the subway?
Sixty cents. But if you spit,
it's a $500 fine.
Then I won't spit.
Good! None of the best people do.
I'll get a job!
That's what I'll do!
I'll get a job!
I'll work!
God, this'll be great!
- Good! Look how excited he is.
- I'll come home from work.
You'll be ironing.
We'll eat some cheap,
disgusting food.
Stop!
I think we're in trouble.
That is out of the question!
There has never been such a thing
as a working-class Bach!
And there never will be!
Step! Step!
I've reached a decision.


                                    Page 42/44

The Bach family must endure.
And not on a subway.
Your children will be
senators, ambassadors.
Perhaps even a president!
You have your 750 million dollars.
All right!
I don't know, Martha.
You don't know?!
- Money has screwed me up my whole life.
- I know!
I've always been rich
and never been happy.
I've always been poor
and usually been happy.
Rubbish! I've always been rich
and I've always been happy.
Would you make me
a tuna fish sandwich?
I'm going to have
a tuna fish sandwich, Martha.
Step.
I demand that you take this money.
I want a decision
and I want it now!
I can't tell you what a lousy
wedding that was, Bitterman.
Bitterman, goodbye.
I'm going.
Goodbye, sir.
It was a pleasure working for you.
Chauffeurs rarely get to laugh.
Thank you.
- Goodbye, Bitterman.
- Goodbye, miss.
Arthur, I'm going!
Open that door, Rockland!
- Ever been on a yacht?
- No, is it wonderful?
It doesn't suck.
I shall never offer you
this money again.
I wish you luck in your poverty.
Excuse me.


                                 Page 43/44

What happened?
I turned her down.
She invited us for dinner
and I said...
...we're having a tuna fish sandwich.
So I turned her down.
I took the money, I mean,
I'm not crazy!
Do you want to double your salary?
- Then open that door.
- Right away, sir.
Is that funny?
Where to, sir?
The park. Drive through the park.
You know how I love the park.
- Get in! Step!
- Step!

1   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT         1

    ANGLE ON apartment doorway. As it opens and an enormously
    SWEET-FACED, ELDER WOMAN steps out, bungled up against the
    cold -- turning back to call inside to the unseen love of
    her long life.

                        SWEET-FACED WOMAN
              I'm just going to get some flowers,
              dear. I'll be back in twenty
              minutes. It's tulip season today.
              I'm so happy.

    And now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness
    dissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that
    quickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her
    apartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated.

    POV - MELVIN UDALL

    in the hallway... Well past 50... unliked, unloved,
    unsettling. A huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever
    met. Right now all his considerable talent and strength is
    totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the elevator
    door he holds open.

                        MELVIN
              Come here, sweetheart... come on.

                        ON DOG
              Sniffing at a particular spot on
              the hall carpeting. Melvin lets the
              elevator door close and advances on
              the mutt who has ignores him.

                        MELVIN
              Wanna go for a ride? Okay, sweetie?

    The dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges
    and picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog urine
    squirts the hall wall for a second or two. The DOG sensing a
    kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK.

                        MELVIN
                  (a malevolent tone)
              You've pissed your last floor, you
              dog-eared monkey.

    The dog takes a snap at Melvin, but the man is much meaner
    and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout shut with his
    hand and reaches for the door of the garbage chute.

                                                           2.


                        MELVIN
              I'll bet you wish you were some
              sort of real dog now, huh? Don't
              worry... this is New York. If you
              can make it here, you can make it
              anywhere, you know? You ugly,
              smelly fuck.

    And with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and lets
    go. We hear a FADING SERIES of PLEADING ""ANOOOOS"" from the
    DOG fade to nothingness... as another apartment door opens
    emitting the loud sounds of a PARTY and SIMON NYE, early
    30s. Simon has been born and raised with Gothic horror and
    it's strange that what that stew of trauma has produced is a
    gifted, decent man.

2   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT         2

    Frantic... he bolts into the hall... Melvin is just about to
    enter his apartment.

                        SIMON
              Verdell!?!! Here, good doggie...

    He notices Melvin at the far end of the hall.

                        SIMON
              Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!
                  (as Melvin turns)
              Have you seen Verdell?

                        MELVIN
              What's he look like?

    Melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is
    directly opposite Simon's.

                        SIMON
              My dog... you know... I mean my
              little dog with the adorable
              face... Don't you know what my dog
              looks like?

                        MELVIN
              I got it. You're talking about your
              dog. I thought that was the name of
              the colored man I've been seeing in
              the hall.

    Simon looks O.S. -- and sees his black friend.

                        SIMON
              Which color was that?

                                                       3.


                    MELVIN
          Like thick molasses, with one of
          those wide noses perfect for
          smelling trouble and prison food...

Simon has had it.

                    SIMON
          Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.

                    MELVIN
              (not missing a beat)
          How're you doing?

                    SIMON
          Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I
          think you know that.

                    FRANK
              (overlapping)
          Simon, you've got to get dressed.

                    MELVIN
              (to Simon)
          What I know is that as long as you
          keep your work zipped up around me,
          I don't give a fuck what or where
          you shove your show. Are we being
          neighbors for now?

                    SIMON
              (to Frank)
          Do you still think I was
          exaggerating?

FRANK can only smile.

                    FRANK
          Definitely a package you don't want
          to open or touch.

                    MELVIN
          Hope you find him. I love that dog.

Simon, terminally non-confrontational, still finds himself
compelled to turn back toward Melvin.

                    SIMON
              (directly)
          You don't love anything, Mr. Udall.

Simon closes his door leaving Melvin alone in the hallway.

                                                              4.


                        MELVIN
              I love throwing your dog down the
              garbage chute.

3   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT                      3

    Melvin locks and unlocks and locks his door, counting to
    five with each lock. He turns the lights quickly on and off
    and on five times and makes a straight-line towards his
    bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens the
    medicine chest.

4   INT. MEDICINE CHEST                                            4

    Scores of neatly stacked Neutrogena soaps. He unwraps one --
    begins to wash -- discards it -- goes through the process
    two more times.

5   INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT                  5

    A group of PARTY GOERS enters -- followed by a HANDYMAN
    holding Verdell who looks and finds:

                        SIMON
              who looks up -- lights up -- and
              tears up as he moves quickly toward
              the group and his dog.

                        SIMON
              Thank the good Lord... wow... my
              honey... where have you been?

                        PARTY GOER
                  (thinking the greeting's
                   for him)
              He always liked me.

    As Simon goes past him to take the dog from the Handyman...
    JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a laugh at the Party
    Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love. As the others greet
    Simon, Jackie directs the group inside. Jackie lingers,
    looking on affectionately as Simon picks some awful, sticky
    gunk from the dog's body... he puts Verdell down to reach
    for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS in protest.

                        SIMON
              Just for a second, okay?

    The DOG YAPS ""no."" Simon, delighted, picks him up again.

                        SIMON
                  (kissing him on the
                   mouth)

                                                            5.


              Look at him...    where was little
              baby?

                        HANDYMAN
                  (smiling)
              In the basement garbage bin eating
              diaper shit.

    Simon reacts -- then notices the Handyman, tongue in cheek,
    trying to suppress his amusement.

                         SIMON
              Go ahead, John, you earned your
              fun.
                   (looking at Verdell)
              How did he get down in the
              basement? I mean even if he got on
              the elevator how... ?

                        HANDYMAN
              Maybe some nice neighbor shoved him
              down the garbage chute.

                        SIMON
              My God! No!

    He stares out... Frank frustrated following.

6   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - NIGHT                     6

    Quiet -- safe -- just Melvin's voice reading aloud as he
    writes.

                        MELVIN
              'Somewhat in the dark, she had
              confessed and he had forgiven. This
              is what you live for, he said. Two
              heads on a pillow where there is
              only the safety of being with each
              other. How, she wondered, could she
              find such hope in the most shameful
              part of her.'

    He barely reacts as we hear a LOUD KNOCKING at he reads.

                           SIMON (O.S.)
              Mr. Udall.

    But Melvin's into it. His fingers flying as he reads.

                        MELVIN
              'At last she was able to define
              love. Love was... '

                                                              6.


    More KNOCKING.

                        SIMON (O.S.)
              Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you
              please.

                        MELVIN
              'Love was... '

    He almost has the rest of the sentence -- the meaning of
    love -- but the knocking throws him.

                        MELVIN
              ... Son-of-a-bitch-pansy-assed-
              stool-pusher.

    He burst from his chair.

7   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - NIGHT           7

    As Simon hears MELVIN through the door and takes a step
    back. Melvin throws open the door. He looks demonic.

                         MELVIN
                  (loud and angry)
              Yeeeess!!!

                        SIMON
              Maybe this can wait.

    Frank signals encouragement as Melvin opens the door.

                        SIMON
              I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

                        MELVIN
              Well, that's a load off.

    Melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to close
    the door when Simon has another burst of bravery.

                        SIMON
              Did you... do something to him?

                        MELVIN
              Do you realize that I work at him?

                        SIMON
                  (eyes downcast)
              No, I didn't.

                                                       7.


                    MELVIN
          Do you like to be interrupt when
          you are danging around in your
          little garden?

                    SIMON
          No... actually, I even shut the
          phone off and put a little piece of
          cardboard in the ringer so no one
          can just buzz me from d...

                    MELVIN
          Well, I work all the time. So
          never, never again interrupt me.
          Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years
          from now... not if there's fire.
          Not even if you hear a thud from
          inside my home and a week later
          there's a smell from in there that
          can only come from a decaying body
          and you have to hold a hanky
          against your face because the
          stench is so thick you think you're
          going to faint even then don't come
          knocking or, if it's election night
          and you're excited and want to
          celebrate because some fudge-packer
          you dated has been elected the
          first queer President of the United
          States... and he's going to put you
          up in Camp David and you just want
          to share the moment with someone...
          don't knock ... not on this door.
          Not for anything. Got me.
          Sweetheart?

                    SIMON
          Yes. It's not a subtle point you're
          making.

                    MELVIN
          Okay, then.

Melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut.

                    SIMON
          So the theory of confrontations is
          that now he'll think twice before
          messing with me?

Frank smiles affectionately. Simon turns serious.

                    SIMON
          He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?

                                                       8.


                    FRANK
          Won't worry about it. You go ahead.

Frank waits till Simon EXITS SCENE and then knocks loudly on
Melvin's door. There is a sharp change in his demeanor.

                    MELVIN (O.S.)
          Oh, I'm pissed!! Now I am really
          pissed!!!

Frank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open.
Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him
forward... Melvin is scared. Operating on survival mode.

                    MELVIN
          No touch. No touch. No touch.

                    FRANK
          You may think you can intimidate
          the whole world with your attitude,
          but I grew up in Hell. My
          grandmother had more attitude. You
          don't intimidate me.

                    MELVIN
              (calling)
          Police! Police! Fucking crooked
          police... doughnut-munching morons
          help me!
              (to Frank)
          Assault and battery and you're
          black.

                    FRANK
          Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him
          enough to batter you unrecognizable
          if you verbally abuse him or so
          much as touch his dog again.
          Meanwhile, I'll try and think how
          you can make this up to him.
              (suddenly loud)
          I hate doing this. I'm an art
          dealer.
              (beat)
          Have a nice day. Party!

He tosses Melvin back and walks out. Melvin straightens his
shirt as he steps out into the hall. Frank smiles as he re-
enters the other apartment. Melvin appears impressed.

                                                              9.


8   EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET NEAR CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY        8

    A crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin. His walk
    is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the danger
    without giving off the scent of its mounting fear. At times
    he places his palms together and extends his arms cutting a
    path through people. We will be very pointed in the fact
    that he avoids stepping on cracks.

    CLOSER ON MELVIN

    His eyes focused on the terrain.

9   INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY                                  9

    ANGLE ON WAITRESS

    CAROL CONNELLY talks with another MOTHER -- a customer. You
    would not guess it, but her working hours tend to be the
    most carefree time of the day. She is telling a story about
    her son for the umpteenth time.

                         CAROL
                  (to the Mother's little
                   girl)
              Look at you, you're all better.

                        MOTHER
              It's that new medication.

                        CAROL
              You know all my son's stuff, right?

    The Mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but Carol
    interrupts her.

                        CAROL
              No, no, no, I got a date tonight.
              I'm walking out the door this
              morning and he says to me, 'Mom, I
              promise not to get one of my fevers
              or coughs during your date.'

                        MOTHER
              Isn't that sweet.

                        CAROL
              Little blonde angle.
                  (to child,
                   affectionately)
              Eat everything.

                                                      10.


Melvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a table
towards the back and is obviously surprised to find a MAN
and WOMAN sitting at the table.

                    WOMAN
          It just came out of me. I said you
          love me the way a remote control
          loves a TV. As long as I switch
          every time...

                       HER MALE COMPANION
          Wonderful.

                    MELVIN
          People who talk in metaphors can
          shampoo my crotch.
              (on their look)
          Eat up.

They turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the waitress
station where two waitresses, LISA and CAROL, are talking.

                    LISA
          Pay me back next week.

                    CAROL
          I owe you. I told you today...
          them's the rules. Oh, excuse me,
          Melvin.

She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out of
the way. He gulps at the contact (since no one else ever
touches him) but covers his self-consciousness.

                    MELVIN
          I'm starving.

                    CAROL
              (firmly to Lisa)
          Will you please take it?

Melvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with stealth,
so that she must touch him again to get him out of the
way...

                    LISA
          This way you take a cab home so you
          have time to get ready for the
          date.

                    CAROL
          ""Ready"" is not my problem.

                                                      11.


She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could read
Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the date
talk. To Carol he is as harmless as furniture.

                    CAROL
              (to Melvin)
          Go sit down. You know you're not
          allowed back here... Spencer's
          more excited about it than I am...
          He says, ""Mom, I promise not to get
          a fever or couch during your date.""

The other WAITRESSES and the SHORT ORDER COOK all go ""awww.""

                    CAROL
          I know. He's just the best.

                    MELVIN
          I've got Jews at my table.

                    CAROL
          It's not your table. It's the
          place's table. Behave. This once,
          you can sit at someone else's
          station.

The two waitresses signal their protests.

                    CAROL
          Or you can just wait your turn...

Melvin walks back into the restaurant proper... he hangs
near their table... his discomfort builds in this limbo...
then:

                    MELVIN
          How much more you got to eat? Your
          appetite isn't as big as your
          noses, is it?

                    WOMAN
          What?!!

                    MAN
              (to Woman)
          Let's go --

The Woman starts to protest.

                    MAN
          Let's leave. We're going.

                                                      12.


Melvin sits down at the table -- and takes from his pocket a
plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed. As he opens
his utensils.

                    CAROL
          Bryan says he doesn't care how long
          you've been coming you ever act
          like this again you're barred for
          life. I'm gonna miss the
          excitement, but I'll handle it.

There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some ingredient
of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only one in the
place who can handle him. She starts to clear the table.

                    MELVIN
          The table's fine if it had some
          cholesterol on it. Two sausages,
          six bacon strips, fries, three eggs
          over easy and coffee.

                    CAROL
          You're gonna die soon with that
          diet, you know that?

                    MELVIN
          We're all gonna die soon. I will.
          You will. It sure sounds like your
          son will.

                    ON CAROL
          Stunned. Some crazy street-freak
          has slipped under her perfect guard
          and momentarily devastated her.
          Melvin senses that he's gone way
          too far. He wipes his knife.

                    CAROL
          If you ever mention my son again,
          you will never be able to eat here
          again. Do you understand? Give me
          some sign you understand or leave
          now. Do you understand me...
              (adds truthful label)
          you crazy freak? Do you?!?

A beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing
down.

                    CAROL
          Okay. I'll get your order.

She walks away. Melvin watches her, biting his lower lip. He
takes some napkins and cleans the table himself.

                                                           13.


10   INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                          10

     She is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room
     sofa. He is expertly into foreplay. She begins to make
     noises as she responds... each time startling herself with
     her own noise and trying to reign it in.

     She's two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway --
     the other -- functional mom so blown away by the emergence
     of this sexy self that she laughs. The Young Man stops and
     looks at her.

                              YOUNG MAN
                 What?

                              CAROL
                 I... I...      I don't know...   You
                 got me.

     His eyes try to burn into hers... She is getting excited but
     doesn't know how to play it... He pushes one of the fingers
     of the hand caressing her face toward her mouth... She
     closes her teeth, his fingers attempt opening her mouth. She
     stops him.

                           CAROL
                 Let me just do whatever I do by
                 myself... I'll catch up to you
                 someplace I promise.
                     (as he's put off)
                 Oh, no... don't look like that.
                 No. I'm sorry if I'm a goof.

     And so with earnestness and caring, she has transformed the
     sex into something more intimate -- and, talk about egg in
     your beer, hotter. Things are getting wild when we hear from
     the distance a child, SPENCER, CALLING and

     COUGHING.

                              CAROL
                 Kissing...     kissing boys. Oh my.

     Carol pulls her head away -- as Spencer's call continues.

                           SPENCER (O.S.)
                     (softly)
                 Grandma, grandma...

                           YOUNG MAN
                 Maybe you better check.

                                                           14.


                         CAROL
               Like what did you think I was going
               to do?

11   INT. HALLWAY/BEVERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT                       11

     Pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway...
     she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her mother,
     BEVERLY, is listening to music on headphones... she takes
     them off when she sees Carol, then hears the cough.

                         BEVERLY
               I'm sorry. I was hearing just
               everything you were doing so I put
               these on to give you privacy.

     Carol now goes into her son's room.

12   INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - NIGHT                               12

     The room is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights... two
     drugstore de-humidifying filters, a nebulizer (breathing
     contraption) a waste basket... a night stand filled with
     medicine, a blood pressure kit... along with some stacks of
     seven-year-old toys and a small TV wedged into the tiny
     space.

                            SPENCER
               I'm sorry.

                         CAROL
               Don't be silly. How bad?

                            SPENCER
               Not bad.

     Carol feels his head... that's okay. Then he coughs --
     trying to suppress it... then a bigger cough... they each
     know what that signals... She brings up a waste basket as
     he throws up... she comforts him. He apologizes. She loves
     him.

13   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  13

     As she re-enters. He is taking a cigarette from a pack.

                         CAROL
                   (a bit panicked)
               You can't smoke... He can't take
               smoke.

     He palms the cigarette -- resumes making out -- his hand
     squeezes her breast -- then he stops and looks at his hand.

                                                           15.


     She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he picked up while
     feeling her and then notices him looking at her with extreme
     distaste... She barks a laugh to cover her embarrassment
     but speaks the truth.

                            CAROL
               Oh, God...     I don't even notice
               anymore.

     She crosses to the kitchen for a dishtowel. Tries to make
     light.

                         CAROL
               That'll teach you.

                         YOUNG MAN
               Don't apologize.

                         CAROL
                   (perturbed)
               That wasn't an apology.

     She notices his demeanor -- how he avoids looking at her --
     how uncomfortable he is.

                          CAROL
               Hey... this is just a little throw-
               up -- it's nothing to be so
               embarrassed about. Really.
                   (as he shifts
                     uncomfortably)
               Thanks for the dinner. Let me write
               down which trains you take to get
               back.

                            YOUNG MAN
               No way.

     She brightens.

                         YOUNG MAN
               I'll take a cab.

     She deflates as he moves past her.

                         YOUNG MAN
               Too much reality for a Friday
               night.

14   EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT                               14

     A cold night in hell. Three young men bullshit near the
     approach to the tunnel.

                                                      16.


Their names are VINCENT, EVAN and DOUG, who is the oldest at
28. Vincent is dopey and the most likeable of the gritty
little trio.

                    EVAN
          Why is every customer surprised I
          read books?

                    DOUG
              (amazed)
          You read books?

                    EVAN
          Oh, wow! I know this guy! Look! He
          even bought me dinner.

They all focus on a black BMW as it slows and stops in front
of them. CARL checks them out carefully through the front
window. He is talking on the speaker phone.

                    CARL
              (slightly exasperated)
          Look, I just can't. I promised
          Simon I'd find him a model.

                    FRIEND (V.O.)
              (on speaker phone,
               flirting)
          Carl, take me off the speaker. Did
          I tell you that these are house
          seats? C'mon, you could use a
          break. Hello... Carl, are you
          there... hello?

Seeing the hustlers:

                    CARL
          .   ...   I just found a model.

                    DOUG
              (to Carl)
          Hey, how it's goin'...

                       EVAN
          Hey, hi...     remember?

                    CARL
          I only need one.

                    EVAN
          You picked me up, maybe a few
          weeks, I don't know, some time ago.
          You were very flattering about
          our... encounter.

                                                           17.


                         CARL
               Maybe just you and me... but this
               is for a painting. I need a pretty
               face.

     Carl beckons to Vincent who joins him, trying to conceal his
     pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest.

15   INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY                            15

     There is a KNOCK at the door -- Simon crosses to answer. He
     is more relaxed than we've seen him -- a man at peace
     humming to his favorite music, talking to his dog who
     scratches at the door. Simon opens the door to Vincent.

                         SIMON
               Sorry, I was out in the studio
               doing some work and I forgot about
               our appointment.

     He leads the way back toward the studio -- chatting away --
     unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him and
     eyeing the expensive apartment.

                         SIMON
               I usually make such a big deal out
               of picking models but Carl's so
               thorough. I'll bet he drove you
               nuts checking your references.

     And he turns and sees the naked model.

                         SIMON
                   (taken aback)
               This isn't a nude.

     Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes.

                         VINCENT
               Just kidding around.
                   (then mutters)
               So much for love.

16   INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO (MINUTES LATER)         16

     Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the
     increasingly uneasy Simon.

                         SIMON
               Exactly what is your previous
               experience?

                                                        18.


                    VINCENT
          How about that pose?
              (sing-song)
          This is not fun...
              (then)
          Give me some direction.

Vincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive. He
tries not to show it.

                    SIMON
          Nothing. I just watch till
          something strikes me. Do anything
          you think of -- try different
          thing. Until I say, ""hold that
          pose."" Then just try and
          comfortably hold it.

                    VINCENT
              (trying another space)
          The fact that you haven't said,
          ""hold it"" means I haven't done it
          right... is that correct? I
          haven't done it right?

                    SIMON
          No... Okay. What I do is watch and
          wait for, um... You ever watch
          someone who doesn't know you're
          watching... an old woman on a bus,
          kids going to school and you see
          this flash come over them and you
          know immediately that it has
          nothing to do with anything
          external -- that it's in respond to
          a private thought they just had?
          They are just sort of realer and
          more alive. And when you notice it
          so are you. If you look at someone
          long enough, you discover their
          humanity.

Vincent's slack-jawed expression changes. He feels an
intellectual tingle to be having this conversation.

                    VINCENT
          I know exactly what you mean.

There's a joy in him at this moment -- a bit of purity.

                     SIMON
          Hold it.

                                                           19.


     Vincent does so -- hums a bit of ""Satisfaction"" to
     celebrate.

17   INT. RESTAURANT - DAY                                   17

     Carol and LESLIE, another waitress, are waiting for their
     order at the cappuccino bar. Leslie is telling the story of
     the traumatic audition which may have turned her life. Carol
     is rapt.

     As they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give him
     notice. Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so -- hard
     not to be since he is giving a moment to moment commentary
     on her every action.

                         MELVIN
               Clippity clop -- clippity clop --
               she has to pretend she doesn't hear
               me. Listening to the story from the
               upset friend... now she drops off
               the cappuccino and smiles at the
               putzette who doesn't even say,
               ""Thank you."" No, the putzette
               wanted the whipped cream so back
               she goes and now she has to pass
               him again and it's getting tougher
               to make believe.

                         CAROL
                   (reluctant forgiveness)
               Okay.

     Melvin stops -- she passes behind him to deliver an
     uncharacteristic rabbit punch.

                         CAROL
               What's with the plastic picnic
               ware? Why not try ours... afraid
               it isn't clean?

                         MELVIN
               I see the help -- judgement call.

                         CAROL
               Just give yourself a little pep
               talk. ""Must try other people's
               clean silverware as part of the fun
               of dining out.""

                         MELVIN
               What's wrong with your son, anyway?

                         CAROL
               What do you care?

                                                           20.


     Melvin just looks at her.

                            CAROL
                  He's gotta fight to breathe. His
                  asthma can just shoot off the
                  charts -- he's allergic to dust and
                  this is New York and his immune
                  system bails on him when there's
                  trouble so an ear infection... Is
                  this bothering you?

                              MELVIN
                        (caught)
                  No.

                            CAROL
                  An ear infection can send us to the
                  emergency room -- maybe five, six
                  times a month where I get whatever
                  nine-year-old they just made a
                  doctor. Nice chatting with you.

                              MELVIN
                  His name?

                              CAROL
                  Spencer.

                              MELVIN
                  Okay.

                            CAROL
                      (quietly)
                  Spence.

     She exits.

18   INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO - DAY (SEVERAL WEEKS LATER)
                                                              18

     The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary, as Simon puts the
     finishing touches on his painting of Vincent. A beat and
     then a strange figure crosses between the CAMERA and the
     scene -- gone before we can examine him further.

                            SIMON
                  You can put on anything you want
                  now. I might be sort of done
                  here...

     Vincent quickly and expertly picks a CD to meet his
     immediate needs and puts it on -- dying a little at every
     second of silence during the transition... then LOUD MUSIC
     PLAYS... Vincent even GOOSING the VOLUME.

                                                              21.


     Simon does a take -- he gestures Vincent to take it down --
     which Vincent does.

     ANGLE - APARTMENT

     where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress --
     Vincent's two friends from the street sweeping all objects
     into large sacks -- one of them, Doug, pauses to look past
     the terrace to the studio.

                         DOUG
               Lucky Vinnie -- he's a painting.

19   INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, STUDIO - DAY                       19

     MUSIC PLAYS -- Simon cleaning up his stuff.

                         VINCENT
               So you're practically finished,
               huh?

                         SIMON
               Yes... well, there's one more
               stage -- trying to figure out if
               it's any good.

     Simon sneaks a look at the canvas from another
     perspective... he focuses -- then the smallest shy nod of
     self-approval -- he's finished. Vincent is desperate to
     distract.

     CLOSE ON dog as Verdell awakens, stretches and pricks his
     ears. He moves quickly to the closed door and starts to
     frantically scratch, attracting Simon's attention.

     As Simon keeps walking...   Vincent shoots over to the
     canvas.

                         VINCENT
               Wait -- I want to see the painting.

                         SIMON
               Just a second -- he has to go.

                         VINCENT
               Please!! NO!!!

     Simon opens the door and Verdell shoots out like a bullet.
     Vincent pauses before the painting and is thrown to see his
     humanity captured -- to be ""immortalized.""

                                                           22.


20   INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY              20

     Doug and Evan are nearly to the front door as VERDELL stops
     them with a vicious GROWL and BARK.

     Simon is distracted -- looking down at his pet so that he
     continues to walk toward Doug and Evan, not noticing them --
     Vincent, terribly afraid, appears behind Simon.

                         SIMON
                   (to Vincent)
               What's the matter, sweetheart?

     He instantly stops. Shocked. Frozen. His eyes on the
     stranger, Doug, looking at him. Now Vincent comes in. Doug
     greets him.

                         DOUG
               Yo.

     Simon turns to Vincent.

                         SIMON
               Why are you doing this?

                         VINCENT
               No. No. No. Hey, that painting in
               there... I just want to tell
               you...

     Now Evan appears holding a brass hat rack.

                         EVAN
                   (to Vincent)
               What are you doing? Cruising him?

     And he uses the hat rack first as a spear, then as a club,
     as the brief savage attack begins.

                         ON VERDELL
               as he starts to go toward Simon and
               then scurries back in fear. The
               three attackers leave. Now silence.
               A single BARK from VERDELL.

21   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DUSK     21

     A mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is
     whisked down to the elevator. It's impossible to tell if
     Simon is awake or dead. Melvin is standing against the wall
     near his door a cop, RAY, interviewing him.

                                                            23.


                         RAY
               Okay. So you call 911 and don't
               leave your name -- even a dumb
               geezer should know that emergency
               automatically pulls up your name.
               How come you make a mistake like
               that?

                         MELVIN
               How come you're pretending to do
               cop work -- 'cause I don't think
               you could find your ass if you were
               spotted the hole.

                         RAY
                   (stunned)
               What?

                         MELVIN
               Just move on. No one here killed
               him.

                         RAY
               Oh, is he dead?

                          MELVIN
               Ask him.

                          RAY
               We will if we can and if we can't,
               we'll come back and ask you again
               and again.

22   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY -           22

23   ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT                                    23

     Frank standing upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a leash
     and VERDELL, who is more upset making pathetic little CRYING
     SOUNDS.

     As we FOCUS BRIEFLY ON Verdell...   Frank is talking to the
     Sweet-Faced Woman.

                         SWEET-FACED WOMAN
               I've been praying for him since I
               heard.

                         FRANK
               So I've got to get to the hospital.
               If you could take the dog just for
               tonight.

                                                           24.


                         SWEET-FACED WOMAN
               Oh, Lord -- I've got all these
               antique knick-knacks... Or else
               I'd be glad...

                         FRANK
               Maybe if you kept locked in the
               bathroom. No? Okay. Thanks.
                   (as he turns away and she
                    closes the door he adds)
               Old bitch... Damn dog.

     A short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed and
     enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings...

     VERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches his
     mugger:

                         FRANK
               You're taking him... yes...
               you're taking him -- this will
               clear the books. One night. You
               want to say ""no"" to me? Try...
               because I've never felt as nuts as
               I do right this second. I almost
               want you to try saying ""no.""

                         MELVIN
                   (quietly)
               I'm not saying nothing to you.

                         FRANK
               Thanks for looking after him.

     Frank pushes open the door to Melvin's apartment and places
     Verdell inside.

24   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                         24

     MUSIC IN: as Frank pulls the door partially closed to block
     Verdell's escape.

     The music represents Verdell's state of mind -- trapped in
     the apartment of the man who tried to kill him. We STAY with
     the dog during the O.S. dialogue: As his head turns in panic
     we see his various POVs as the dialogue continues O.S.

                         MELVIN (O.S.)
               Hey, where are you going? You can't
               do this.
                   (calls after Frank)
               I can't take a dog.
                   (a confession)
               Nobody's ever been in here before.

                                                           25.


                         FRANK (O.S.)
                   (threatening)
               You don't want to mess with me
               today. I'll figure something else
               out tomorrow.

25   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT           25

     Melvin enters -- the dog cowers in the shadows. Now Melvin
     sees him.

                         MELVIN
               You're dead!!

     VERDELL STOPS -- gives Melvin wide berth -- slinking along
     the far wall. Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a bit
     calming.

                         MELVIN
               I don't have dog food. And I won't
               want dog food here. You'll eat what
               we have. You'll eat what we eat.

     Melvin exits. Verdell is in a major funk.

26   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT               26

     Melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped
     meat, sticks raw pieces of bacon into it and exits the room.

                         MELVIN
               Don't you touch anything.

27   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT           27

     Verdell cringing as his new master approaches -- MUSIC
     CONTINUES ominously. Melvin sets the bowl down and exits...
     Verdell breathes excitedly though looking alternately in all
     directions... his recent past making him suspect this feast
     is a trick. He sniffs cautiously -- then dives in -- GOTHIC
     MUSIC CHANGING on a dime TO SCORE his RAPTURE... from O.S.
     we hear the sound of RUNNING WATER as steam escapes the
     bathroom -- then MUSIC OUT -- as Melvin returns... ignoring
     Verdell he sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly.
     It's odd. Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the
     bowl with his tail to Melvin. Then Melvin begins to play and
     sing Monty Python's ""Always Look On The Bright Side Of
     Life,"" with its cheerful whistle refrain. Verdell looks over
     with surprise and pleasure. But just as mood lifts and
     warmth threatens, Melvin stops abruptly, turns out the
     lights and exits.

                                                           26.


28   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY                              28

     Frank on the phone.

                         FRANK
                   (into phone)
               Put the solid red dots on three of
               them and the hold blue dots on two
               others... Well, we're not going to
               sell anything if they know we're
               two weeks into a show and have no
               sales. No, you can't reduce a price
               at this stage... We're in free
               fall here. Any calls?

                         JACKIE
               We can see him.

                         FRANK
               I'll meet you in there.

29   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                  29

     As Jackie enters.

                         JACKIE
               How you doing, great one?

                         SIMON
               I haven't looked at myself yet. I
               figured I could tell from your
               reaction.

     He turns toward her. Much of his body -- taped -- his
     painting hand wrapped. Simon's face is something of a
     horror. Swollen, one savage discolored cut. We are into
     yuccchhh... The sight is a jolt. Jackie breaks into
     tears... sobs, actually.

                         SIMON
               That bad, huh?

     They share a helpless half-laugh -- then Frank appears in
     the doorway.

                         FRANK
               Hey, hey...
                   (as he sees him)
               Haaa... bad but temporary. The
               nurses say it's much better than
               you looked three weeks ago... the
               hand will come back... they're
               sure...

                                                      27.


                    SIMON
          Jackie, will you hand me the
          mirror?

                      JACKIE
                (a small voice)
          No.

She starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse -- then
thinks better of it.

                    JACKIE
          Wait, I have a smaller one.

But he holds out his hand and she gives him the mirror -- he
starts to look -- then thinks better of it.

                    SIMON
          So, what's new anyway? How's
          Verdell?

                    FRANK
              (sheepish)
          Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking
          care of him.

                     SIMON
               (suddenly alive and
                upset)
          How could you do that? He'll hurt
          him.

                    FRANK
          No, I promise... not a chance. I
          own this guy. There was no one
          else. I'm on the move too much.
          Trust me.

                    SIMON
          You are very certain my dog is
          okay... because you have no
          idea...

                    FRANK
          Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.

Simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery,
then he takes a breath -- like someone about to dive
underwater. First a small, mumbled pep talk to himself.

                    SIMON
          Okay, waiting gives the devil time.
          Now!

                                                           28.


     He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror... he
     is startled -- the bottom drops out -- leaving him awed by
     his misfortune.

                         SIMON
               Oh my... Where'd I go? Ummmm?

30   EXT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY                              30

     AN ESTABLISHING SHOT FEATURING Verdell tied up in front.

31   INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY                              31

     Melvin finishing a plate of eggs, bacon and sausage with his
     plastic knife and fork. Carol looks totally beat as she sets
     down a cup of coffee. Melvin is craning periodically to keep
     an eye of his dog.

                         CAROL
               So what are you doing with a dog?

                         MELVIN
               Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.

                         CAROL
               You're not worried that someone
               might take him?

                         MELVIN
               Well, not until now -- for Christ's
               sake.

                         CAROL
               Sorry.

                         MELVIN
               It's okay -- I'll sit here.

     He changes tables for the first time ever so that he can
     keep an eye on Verdell. Carol is amazed.

                         CAROL
               You know he's a little dog. Next
               time, if Bryan's not here, you can
               bring him in.

                         MELVIN
               How old are you?

                         CAROL
               Oh, please...

                                                      29.


                    MELVIN
          If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd
          say you were fifty.

Carol looks at him.

                    CAROL
          And if I had to guess by your eyes.
          I'd say you were kind. So, so much
          for eyes. But as long as you bring
          up age... how old are you?

                    MELVIN
              (quickly)
          Otherwise, you're not ugly.

                    CAROL
              (laughs out loud)
          Okay, pal... I accept the
          compliment, but go easy -- my knees
          start a-knocking when you turn on
          the charm full blast.

                    MELVIN
          What's with the dark?

He indicates the bags under her eyes by tapping his own.

                    CAROL
          Dawn patrol -- major dawn patrol.
          My son had a full blown attack. And
          this time, for extra fun, they gave
          us the wrong antibiotics, so I get
          him home...

She reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon -- he goes nuts.

                    MELVIN
          No... no... leave it...    the
          bacon's for the dog.

She is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, but
he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty.

                    MELVIN
          Last week I was playing the piano
          for him and he likes it, and so I
          decide I'm going to make a little
          joke...

                    CAROL
          You all set here?

                                                           30.


     Melvin nods -- a bit frustrated about not being able to
     finish his dog story. He pockets the remaining bacon.

32   EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY                                 32

     As Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, perhaps a beat
     before Melvin, a remarkably event. Verdell is avoiding the
     cracks in the sidewalk.

                         MELVIN
               It's a beautiful day for our walk.

     Melvin slows -- observes the dog mirroring his behavior.

                         ON VERDELL
               again carefully placing his paws to
               avoid a crack in the sidewalk.
               Melvin laughs out loud -- puts on
               plastic gloves hurriedly so he can
               lift the dog to eye level.

                         MELVIN
               Don't be like me, don't you be like
               me. You stay just the way you are
               because you are a perfect man. I'm
               gonna take you home and get you
               something to eat... what you love.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

                         FEMALE PASSERSBY
                   (charmed)
               Ohhh. I'd like to be treated like
               that.

                         MELVIN
                   (all smiles to Verdell)
               Let's go home and do some writing.

33   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT              33

     Melvin whaling away at his computer, reading to himself with
     great satisfaction as he goes.

     Verdell sits at his chair, fascinated by the speed of his
     master's fingers on the keyboard. He reads his writing aloud
     to the dog.

                         MELVIN
               ""He turned off the gas jets and
               carried her outside.

                                                           31.


                 He kissed her brow and when her
                 eyes opened and found him, he said,
                 'there are easier ways to break a
                 date.' She laughed. The only
                 sensible ambition he had ever known
                 was now realized. He had made the
                 girl happy. And what a girl.
                 'You've saved my life,' she said,
                 'you'd better make it up to me.'""

     Exhilarated by his own words, he shuts down the machine...

                           MELVIN
                     (singing to Verdell)
                 Done!
                     (playing with him some)
                 Yes, I hate the doggy... yes, I
                 hate the doggy.

     He exits.

                           MELVIN (V.O.)
                 Sixty-two books... done!

     As the dog goes shooting off to the kitchen we leave our
     couple's play time for...

34   INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY
                                                              34

     As the rookie invalid awakens in precisely the same foul
     mood he'd had on falling asleep. In the living room, the
     maid, NORA, is talking with Jackie -- we catch only a few
     words as they review Simon's mounting pile of bills and talk
     of how long Nora can stay on.

35   INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY           35

     Frank knocking on Melvin's door. He opens it.

                           FRANK
                 How's Verdell doing?

                           MELVIN
                 He's a pain in the ass.

     As he looks over at the dog, Verdell trots over and, without
     realizing it, Melvin smiles at him to Frank's surprise.

                           FRANK
                 Simon's home. I was sort of hoping
                 you could keep the dog until he's
                 had a chance to think and adjust...

                                                             32.


                         MELVIN
                   (leaping at the chance)
               It's been five weeks... another
               few won't kill me.

                         FRANK
               No. He wants him back. He'll be by
               tomorrow.

                         MELVIN
                   (too loudly, weirdly)
               Okay by me.

     Frank exits.

36   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY                36

     Melvin sits -- Verdell looks up at him. Melvin walks to the
     door. He turns the lock... then checks that they are
     locked... checks again to make sure he turned them in the
     correct direction... turns from the door... then back to
     check once more. And again... and again... anguished,
     until now he breaks briefly, the dog looking on.

37   INT. NEW YORK BUILDING - MELVIN'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY
                                                              37

     Melvin opens the door -- looks at the scarred Simon in a
     wheelchair and shudders...

                         MELVIN
               That's some face they left hanging
               on you. You look like...

                         SIMON
                   (interrupting)
               Could you take it just a little
               easy, Mr. Udall?

     A beat of silence as Melvin thinks whether to comply.

                         SIMON
               Thank you. Verdell... sweetheart?
                   (to Melvin)
               By the way, thanks for saving me.

                         MELVIN
               I called. I never touched you. I
               didn't leave my name or nothing.

                         SIMON
                   (not listening)
               Verdell?

                                                              33.


                         ON VERDELL
               Totally weirded out... hiding
               behind Melvin... now Melvin shifts
               and Simon and Verdell see each
               other... Simon smiles at the
               dog... he is emotionally caught up
               in the reunion.

                         SIMON
               Hi, sweetheart.

     Verdell isn't eager.

                          ON SIMON
               The first gnawing pains of
               rejection.

38   INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY                                  38

     Simon pats his leg -- trying unsuccessfully to get Verdell
     to approach him. Instead the dog goes to the door and
     scratches at it. Jackie starts to pick the dog up.

                         SIMON
               No. Please, don't force him.

                         JACKIE
                   (to dog)
               You little stinker. He's given you
               everything.

39   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY                   39

                         MELVIN'S POV
               Verdell's towel on the floor --
               near his bowl.

                                                   BACK TO SCENE

     Melvin's lips compress... he sits on the piano bench and
     hits a few keys... looks at Verdell's empty spot again...
     there are those who ""get the joke"" -- Melvin is clearly one -
     - he laughs suddenly and helplessly even as he feels the
     panic rise in him...

     ... all his painstaking success in keeping the lid on and
     now it threatens to blow for a reason he articulates.

                         MELVIN
               Over the dog... an ugly dog.

     It's hilarious. But now the humor detours. An actual sob is
     choked back... he gets up -- following a definite pattern
     across the room.

                                                              34.


     He is conducting a small but highest-stakes fight for
     survival. Momentarily a scared, beaten middle-aged man -- he
     races out the door.

40   EXT. NYC STREETS - DAY                                     40

     Melvin charging as fast as crack checks allow and then
     turning into a building with a copper sign reading
     ""Grammercy Park Psychiatric Group.""

                         MELVIN
               Worst sidewalk in New York and look
               where they put in.

41   INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY                           41

     Melvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word.

                         MELVIN
               Help!

                         DOCTOR
               If you want to see me you will not
               do this. You will make an
               appointment...

                         MELVIN
               Explain to me how you can diagnose
               someone as ""obsessive compulsive
               disorder"" and then act like I have
               any choice in barging in.

                         DOCTOR
               There's not going to be a debate.
               You must leave.

     The Doctor moves into the hallway, forcing Melvin to follow.

                         MELVIN
               You said you could help me -- what
               was that -- a tease?

                         DOCTOR
               I can help you if you take the
               responsibility to keep regular app -
               -

                         MELVIN
                   (suddenly)
               You changed the room around...

                         DOCTOR
               Two years ago...

                                                           35.


     Melvin shakes his head -- as if things weren't bad enough he
     must go through a careful exercise noting every new element
     before he's at all comfortable... as he studies each object.
     The Doctor is professionally intrigued despite himself.

                         DOCTOR
               I also regrew my beard... but
               you're not interested in changes in
               me... so it's like I always told
               you... when it comes to people
               you...

                         MELVIN
               Shhhhhhh. I don't have this
               mountain of available time... I
               got to get to my restaurant on
               time. Do you know how hard it is
               for me to be here?

                           DOCTOR
               Yes.
                      (as Melvin starts for the
                       office)
               No.

42   INT. PSYCHIATRISTS' WAITING ROOM - DAY                  42

     More PATIENTS in the almost-crowded waiting room. Melvin
     passes through -- visibly drawn and upset. He stops. Eyes on
     them. Then:

                         MELVIN
                   (to other patients)
               What if this is as good as it gets?

     They look stricken. He exits.

43   INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY                           43

     As he walks to his booth and sits down. Enormous relief.
     CHERYL, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his table
     -- unseen by Melvin as he takes out his utensils and
     arranges them. In a corner booth, four big TRANSIT AUTHORITY
     POLICE are having a meal together. Cheryl looks at his
     utensils.

                         CHERYL
               What the heck are those for?

                         MELVIN
               No. No. Get Carol.

                                                      36.


                    CHERYL
          I'm filling in. We don't know if
          she's coming back. She might have
          to get a job closer to home.

                    MELVIN
          What are you trying to do to me?

                    CHERYL
          What the heck do you mean?

                     MELVIN
          Hey, elephant girl, call her or
          something... just let her do my
          one meal here. I'll pay whatever.
          I'll wait.
              (as she doesn't budge; he
               screams)
          Do it!!!

The MANAGER comes over, gesturing to the table of police
that he can handle it. All attention is on Melvin.

                    MANAGER
          Out. Be silent or leave.

                    MELVIN
          I'll be quiet. Just let me wait. No
          problem. Get her here -- have her
          get me two sausages, four bacon,
          two eggs over easy and coffee. I'm
          not a prick here -- I'm a great
          customer. This day is a disaster. I
          can't handle this, too.

                    MANAGER
          Get out immediately or there's
          going to be trouble.

Melvin looks at the police, sizes up the hopeless situation
and rises.

                    MELVIN
          There's going to be trouble???

He walks toward the door as Cheryl and all the other
employees applaud his defeat. As he passes a BUSBOY near the
door he hands him 20 dollars.

                    MELVIN
          Carol's last name?

                      BUSBOY
          Connelly.

                                                              37.


44   EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY                                 44

     An uncomfortable Melvin sitting in the back of a taxi.

                         MELVIN'S POV
               A neighborhood in Brooklyn -- a
               community. Melvin, ever the shark
               observer, looks from the cab to see
               slices of community life -- MEN in
               front of a bar, PARENTS giving
               their CHILD a ride on a mechanical
               horse outside a local store -- two
               YOUNG WOMEN discuss dating.

45   EXT. CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY                                45

     As he exits -- RINGS the BELL and is BUZZED in.

46   INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DOOR/HALLWAY - DAY       46

     Carol opens the door just as he arrives on her landing. She
     holds a container of ice, washclothes and a thermometer.

                          MELVIN
               I'm hungry.
                   (on Carol's astonished
                    look)
               You've upset my whole day. I
               haven't eaten.

                         CAROL
               What are you doing here?

     Melvin ignores the question, instead answering a charge he
     had imagined she might make...

                         MELVIN
               This is not a sexist thing. If you
               were a waiter I would still be here
               saying...

                         CAROL
               Are you totally gone? This is my
               private home...

                         MELVIN
               I am trying to keep emotions out of
               this. Even though this is an
               important issue to me and I have
               strong feelings about the subject.

                                                      38.


                    CAROL
          What subject? That I wasn't there
          to take crap from you and bring you
          eggs? Do you have any control over
          how creepy you allow yourself to
          get?

                    MELVIN
          Yes, I do, as a matter of fact...
          and to prove it I have not gotten
          personal and you have. Why aren't
          you at work? You're not sick -- you
          don't look sick... just very tired
          and bitter.

                    CAROL
          My son is sick, okay?

Even saying the sentence, ""My son is sick"" pushes some
emotions toward the surface which are wasted on the crazy
man at her threshold.

                    MELVIN
          What about your mother?

                    CAROL
          How do you know about my mother?

                    MELVIN
          I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!

She crosses to the sink to dump the ice. Melvin takes a step
inside. Spencer, seven and looking ill, walks into the room.

                    CAROL
          Sorry, honey...     I'll be right
          there.

                    MELVIN
              (uncomfortably)
          How ya doing?

Spencer just stares at him.

                    MELVIN
              (miffed)
          You should answer when someone
          talks to you...

Carol eyes Melvin with disgust and disbelief then
emphatically gestures him to ""clear out."" Melvin backs out
the door.

                                                           39.


                         CAROL
               Sorry. There is a limit, Melvin,
               and I can't handle you teaching my
               son manners.

     She closes the door in his face, then walks to her son and
     leads him back to his room.

47   INT. SPENCER'S ROOM                                     47

     CAMERA MOVES TOWARD mother and son sitting on the edge of
     Spencer's bed. She holds a digital thermometer to his ear.
     They both count down the seconds.

                             CAROL AND SPENCER
               4...   3...     2... 1... Bingo.

                             SPENCER


                         CAROL
               We are going to treat ourselves to
               a cab ride.

48   EXT. BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - ANGLE ON CAROL - DAY           48

     As Carol carries her young son through a class of uniformed
     KIDS from a Catholic elementary school. She spots Melvin
     about to enter a cab.

                         CAROL
               Melvin, wait!

     The school kids pick up the chant in unison.

                         SCHOOL KIDS
               Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait! Melvin,
               wait!

     He turns to face them.

                         MELVIN
               Shut up, kids!

     They immediately obey as Carol approaches him.

                         CAROL
               Melvin... give us a lift. We've
               got to go see our friends at the
               hospital.

     Melvin is thrown... he pauses a beat... then holds the
     rear door open as Carol hustles the kid inside. The maneuver
     puts the beet red, sweating Spencer at his face.

                                                           40.


                         MELVIN
               I'll ride up front. Cover your
               mouth when you cough, kid.

49   INT. BROOKLYN CAB - DAY                                 49

     As they settle in and drive off.

                         CAROL
               Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital,
               please and quickly please.

50   EXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY                      50

     As Carol enters the hospital.

                         CAROL
                   (calling back)
               I owe you three dollars.

     Melvin follows behind her as she carries her son...

                         MELVIN
               Yeah, yeah... any chance you'll
               get back to work today?

                         CAROL
                   (furiously)
               No!!! Stay away from me!

51   INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY                            51

     Verdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for
     Melvin. Jackie sits across from Simon's wheel chair... she
     has some index cards in her laps which she occasionally
     consults and shuffles.

                         JACKIE
               I feel terrible that I have to...
               Simon? Forget about the dog for a
               second.

     Simon forces his attention to Jackie.

                         SIMON
               Sorry. What are those cards?

                          JACKIE
                    (a bit embarrassed)
               Frank's idea. He thought I should
               have notes so I did this right...
               maintained focus, didn't get
               emotional and tried not to terrify
               you.

                                                      41.


                    SIMON
              (scared shitless)
          Terrify me?

                    JACKIE
          See, he's right. I need the cards.
              (reading from cards)
          Simon, you're broke.

ANGLE ON VERDELL

as their conversation continues -- the dog is distressed.

                    JACKIE (O.S.)
          The medical bill are 61 thousand
          now. I've spoken to your parents
          and they didn't hang up or anything
          -- they just said they would feel
          strange calling you.

                    SIMON (O.S.)
          Well, I can't reach them.

Verdell walks out on the terrace and looks off. He turns
for:

                     SIMON
              (to Verdell)
          Here, baby... what is it,
          Verdell?... You miss the tough
          guy...
              (trying to be Melvin-
               like)
          Well, here I am, you little pissant
          mop, happy to see me? How about
          another ride down the chute? Oh,
          God... I don't mean it,
          sweetheart...
              (on Jackie's look)
          I'm sorry. I know...

Verdell hides behind a chair.

                    JACKIE
          Frank loves you. You know that...
          but I've spoken to him and he feels
          that --
              (reading from card)
          -- as a businessman, with limited
          resources...

                                                           42.


                         SIMON
               I'll be able to keep my apartment
               and studio, won't I?... Just tell
               me.

     As Jackie looks at him then thumbs for a card.

                         SIMON
                   (overwhelmed)
               Wow...

     Verdell has come near him -- he reaches out a hand to pet
     the dog and the dog ducks.

52   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - DAY                             52

     He is trying to write. He can't. His world has been upset.
     He walks away from his work -- a highly unusual act. He is
     distressed -- and then an idea and he exits.

53   INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - DAY                             53

     We are looking at ZOE, the receptionist. She is listening
     with interest to an O.S. conversation while answering phone
     calls, ""Premier Publishing.""

                         FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
               Yes, you write more than anyone
               else. Yes, you make us a lot of
               money, but isn't there someone more
               appropriate to...

                         MELVIN (O.S.)
               I need this. Just say, ""Melvin,
               I'll try,"" okay?

                         FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                   (resigned)
               Melvin, I'll try.

     They appear now -- the woman tall, attractive, etc. She
     pauses at the elevator.

                          FEMALE EXECUTIVE
               Now, on a pleasant note, our son
               got accepted at Brown. My
               husband...

                         MELVIN
                   (curtly)
               Great, wonderful. I don't need you
               to wait with me.

                                                              43.


     She nods, pissed, waves and leaves. As Melvin waits, Zoe
     summons her moxie.

                         ZOE
               I can't resist. You usually move
               through here so quickly and I have
               so many questions I want to ask
               you. You have no idea what your
               work means to me.

                         MELVIN
               What's it mean?

                         ZOE
               That somebody out there knows what
               it's like to be...
                   (taps her head and heart)
               in here.

                         MELVIN
               Oh God, this is like a nightmare.

                         ZOE
               Aw come on, just a couple of
               questions -- how hard is that?

     As he hits the button, wipes his fingers, hits the button
     etc.

                         ZOE
               How do you write women so well?

                         MELVIN
                   (as he turns toward her)
               I think of a man and take away
               reason and accountability.

     The fan is jolted as the elevator doors open and close.

54   EXT. STREET NEAR CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY                       54

     A depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home. She is
     suddenly wary -- SOUND DIALED DOWN -- as we MOVE CLOSER.

                         CAROL'S POV
               A car at the curb with ""MD"" license
               plate.

                                                   BACK TO SCENE

     As Carol breaks into a run.

                                                           44.


55   INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWAY/HALLWAY - DAY   55

     As she bounds the stairs, comes to her apartment door and
     jiggles with the keys, a strange prescient whimpering sound
     coming from her. As she enters the apartment.

                         CAROL
               Hello? Hello?

                         VOICE (O.S.)
               Mrs. Connelly, I'm in here.

     The worst confirmed, she moves down the narrow hallway, her
     innards squirting the same chemicals that drives elk on
     opening day of the hunting season.

56   INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - DAY                                 56

                         CAROL
               What? Please? Now? Tell me?!

                         DR. BETTES
               Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes
               ... Dr. Bettes.

                         CAROL
               Not your name... what are you
               telling me your name for!! Where is
               he?

                         DR. BETTES
               He's in the bathroom...   He's fine.

                         CAROL
                   (overlapping)
               Tell me how bad it is. I let him go
               out last night when it was so cool
               without an overshirt -- just and
               underone with just the straps and I
               know better... and I let him talk
               me into it. He was whining and...
               you don't need this. Give me a
               second to catch hold.

     And so she does. Wow does she... and gives us some notion of
     the size of her fear demon and the strength it takes to
     subdue it as Dr. Bettes keeps reassuring her and she keeps
     nodding... finally a deep breath as Spencer enters from the
     bathroom. All at hyper speed now. Salvation as farce.

                         SPENCER
                   (to his mother)
               Hi...
                   (they kiss)

                                                      45.


          Did you know there are doctors who
          come to your house?

                    CAROL
          No, I didn't.
              (to Bettes)
          So why are you h...

Beverly, Carol's mother, enters the room. She is ebullient
which, if life allowed, would be her natural state.

                    BEVERLY
          I didn't know you had a secret
          admire.

                     CAROL
          Huh?

                    BEVERLY
          You met the gift.

                    SPENCER
          He's good... And I'm an expert on
          doctors.

                    CAROL
              (to Spencer)
          Stay out of this...     Doctor?

                     DR. BETTES
          My wife is Melvin Udall's
          publisher.
              (as Carol reacts)
          She says I have to take great care
          of this guy because you're urgently
          needed back at work. What work do
          you do?

                    CAROL
          I'm a waitress.

ON Dr. Bettes' reaction her mother adds a saving grace.

                    BEVERLY
          In Manhattan.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Dr. Bettes?

                     DR. BETTES
          In here.

A NURSE enters.

                                                       46.


                    NURSE
          Sorry it took so long. I don't know
          Brooklyn.

                    DR. BETTES
          It's okay, Terry.
              (hands her blood vail)
          Tell the lab I'd like the report
          back today.

Carol and her mother exchange a look of incredulity.

                    CAROL
          You're going to get the results
          today?!

                    MOVING SHOT
          As we approach the doctor and Carol
          seated across from each other at a
          small table... soft voices...
          relaxation. Bettes is examining
          medicine bottles.

                    DR. BETTES
          How long has he been having
          problems?

                    CAROL
          Since forever.

                    DR. BETTES
          Have they done blood tests on him?

                    CAROL
          Yes.

                    DR. BETTES
          Only in the emergency room or when
          he was well.

                    CAROL
          Emergency room only.

                     DR. BETTES
          Have they done skin testing for
          allergies?

                    CAROL
          No.

                    DR. BETTES
          They haven't done the standard
          scratch test. Where they make small
          injections into the skin?

                                                      47.


                    CAROL
          No. I asked. They said it's not
          covered under my plan. And it's not
          necessary anyway.

                    DR. BETTES
          It's amazing these things weren't
          done.

                    CAROL
          Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of
          shit... I'm sorry... forgive me.

                    DR. BETTES
          No. Actually, I think that's their
          technical name.

                    CAROL
          Once the tests come back, is there
          someone I can reach in your office
          for the results?

                    DR. BETTES
          Me. My home number is on this card.

                    CAROL
          His home number.

Carol look at her mother -- they share a laugh. Beverly has
a hard time stopping.

                    CAROL
              (to doctor)
          Do you want some juice or coffee or
          two female slaves?

                    DR. BETTES
          Water... Nobody told you it might
          be a good idea to remove the
          carpeting and drapes in Spencer's
          room?

                    CAROL
          No.

She starts towards Spencer's room.

                    DR. BETTES
          You don't have to do it this
          second... it's not dangerous or
          anything. It's just something
          that's advisable. Look, there's a
          lot to be checked but...

                                                             48.


               Hey, your son is going to feel a
               good deal better at the very
               least...

     She pats his head...    Then embraces him with fierce
     intimacy.

                         CAROL
               Doc!!!
                   (then)
               So listen, you gotta let me know
               about the additional costs -- one
               way or the other we'll...

                         DR. BETTES
               They're considerable. But Mr. Udall
               wants to be billed.

     She takes this as a blow to the heart, stomach and groin.

57   INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY                              57

     Simon practices walking using his cane. A tearstained Nora
     hugs him good-bye.

                         NORA
               You poor, poor man.

                         SIMON
               Let's use just one poor, okay?
               Anyway, dear, thanks for
               everything. Forgive my recent
               crankiness and as soon as things
               are on track again I'll call.

     She kisses him and starts for the door and suddenly a sharp
     intake of breath -- she's forgotten something.

                         SIMON
               What's wrong?

                         NORA
               Who's going to walk Verdell?

     Simon hadn't thought of this either.

                            SIMON
               No, no.

58   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DAY        58

     Nora holding her things, knocks on Melvin's door. Melvin
     opens the door. Nora is still sniffling. He misinterprets.

                                                           49.


                         MELVIN
               Is he dead yet?

                         NORA
               No! Would there be any way for you
               to be willing to walk his dog for
               him?

                         MELVIN
               Absolutely.

                         NORA
               Not just today -- Uh, could you do
               it -- until, until he gets back on
               his feet?

                         MELVIN
               Sure thing.

                         NORA
               You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock
               is a good time. Here's the key in
               case he's asleep. Open the curtains
               for him, so he sees God's beautiful
               work and knows that even things
               like this happen for the best.

                         MELVIN
               Where'd they teach you to talk like
               this -- some Panama City ""Sailor
               want to hump-hump bar""? Or was
               today getaway day and your last
               shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy
               some place else -- we're all
               stocked up here.

     He closes the door in her face. She stands there... thrown
     by the abruptness -- then lifts the two paper shopping bags
     holding her things -- walks back toward the elevator --
     pausing briefly outside Simon's door -- then continues on
     her way.

59   INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT                                  59

     The doctor gone, mother and daughter arguing.

                         CAROL
               There is a seriously goofy man
               behind this. You are not allowed to
               block out that fact.

                                                           50.


                         BEVERLY
               Do you really want to go back to
               the runt doctors in Emergency who
               keep telling us they can't help?

                         CAROL
               It lets a crazy man into our lives.

                         BEVERLY
               Come on. Why fight when we know how
               it will come out. This isn't like
               stocking or a string of pearls. You
               don't send this one back.

60   EXT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING - DAY              60

61   INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY                              61

     Shades drawn. Simon is a wheelchair... the PHONE RINGS. He
     goes to answer... the phone across the bed so that reaching
     for the phone is a brief but difficult struggle... he grunts
     with pain, hope and anxiety as he answers.

                         SIMON
               Hello?... yes... sure...
               finally, huh? Why, ""finally""?
               Because I called you so many times.
               Maybe

     (relief) Oh, boy... I was hoping it was something like
     that. You didn't get one of them, huh? 'Cause I mean it
     wasn't only your office -- it was your home, hotel and the
     cigar club you like in San Francisco. No -- Sarcastic... Of
     course. I believe you. No, don't fire anyone... Please.
     Maybe I'm wrong about the 20 times. Take a breath... (more)
     So, you miss me a little? Hey, strike the question -- How's
     the case going? Really. Fantastic. I didn't hear. I haven't
     been watching. Great. Just great. I'm so happy. Whoopie! Me?
     Well, I'm mending. No, I look fine. Well, some of the damage
     might still be noticeable if you look closely...

     He runs a hand across his scarred and still bloated and
     beaten face...

                          SIMON
               Carl, I need some help and you're
               the logical one to turn to.
                   (aghast)
               No! Not 'cause I blame you for what
               happened. I hardly get how you can
               ever think that. No, I'm not being
               sarcastic.
                   (trying to figure it out)

                                                      51.


          I guess because you hired the guy
          who did this you think... No, I am
          a sarcastic person. Well, if you
          must know, the reason I said you
          were the logical person is because
          you always told me how you thought
          I was this great person who made
          you feel good about humanity and
          everything. You do remembering
          saying that? Well, whew. Okay, so
          Carl. I hate asking but this money
          thing is ridiculously serious...

He picks up an index card from his night stand and takes the
leap -- reading the text he prepared in advance.

                    SIMON
          ""Will you please loan me money? I
          will pay you back. I will give you
          whatever percentage of my income I
          don't absolutely need until I do.
          It will take a while. But I don't
          know what I'll do if you say""...
          that.
              (as he listens)
          I understand... yes... No, I do.
              (a bit of boldness)
          But you know, you know -- you
          didn't even ask how much, Carl?
          Well, Frank has no right to discuss
          how much I'm in hock... no, you're
          right -- not the point. So... what
          have you been up to??? Uh-huh...
          Oh, the group show... how was it?
          Well, I'm not surprised that
          there's that much talent around...
          great... Look -- gotta go... no,
          you shouldn't feel that way at
          all... take care, you, too...
          you, too... Good-bye.
              (as he hangs up)
          Pal o' mine.

It's very quiet.

LONG SHOT - SIMON

A lonely figure -- who now holds his good hand up to his
face and appears on the verge of enormous emotional release -
- CAMERA MOVES TOWARD him as if to rendezvous with the
moment of catharsis...

                                                      52.


... but Simon is denied even this small luxury as the
CAMERA ABRUPTLY ADJUSTS just as he begins sobbing to focus
on the door opening and Melvin and Verdell entering the
room.

                    MELVIN
          Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

                    SIMON
          Thank you for walking him.

Simon wheels away from Melvin.

                    SIMON
          If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling
          so well.

                    MELVIN
          It smells like shit in here?

                     SIMON
          Go away.

                    MELVIN
          That cleaning woman doesn't...

                    SIMON
          Please, just leave.

                    MELVIN
          Where are all your queer party
          friends?

                    SIMON
              (his first shout)
          Get out.

Melvin pauses -- Simon weeping... Verdell looks at Simon
with concern. Melvin is thrown. Moved?

                    SIMON
          Nothing worse than having to feel
          this way in front of you?

                    MELVIN
          Nellie, you're a disgrace to
          depression.

                    SIMON
          Rot in hell, Melvin.

                                                      53.


                    MELVIN
          No need to stop being a lady...
          quit worrying -- you'll be back on
          your knees in no time.

Simon swings his arm and cast at Melvin -- the sudden attack
jolts Melvin but not as much as what follows.

                    SIMON
          Is this fun for you? Well, you
          lucky devil... It just gets better
          and better. I am losing my
          apartment and Frank wants me to
          promise to paint hotter subjects
          and to beg my parents, who haven't
          called, for help... and I won't.
          And I don't want to paint anymore.

Melvin has made for the door...   Simon blocks him.

                    SIMON
          So the life I was trying for is
          over. The life I had is gone and I
          am feeling so damn sorry for myself
          that it is difficult to breathe.
          Right times for you -- huh, Melvin.
          The gay neighbor is terrified...
              (a sudden screamed word
               surprises them both)
          Terrified... Lucky you, you're
          here for rock bottom... me
          wallowing in self-pity in front of
          you, you absolute horror of a human
          being...

As Simon works to stop crying, Melvin is weird with
discomfort.

                    MELVIN
          Well, I'll do one thing for you
          that might cheer you up.

                     SIMON
          Get out.

                    MELVIN
          Don't piss on a gift, tough guy.
          You want to know why the dog
          prefers me... it's not affection.
          It's a trick.

Simon looks up, his mood turning on a dime -- he's rapt...
Melvin comes and stands by his wheelchair.

                                                            54.


                         MELVIN
               I carry bacon in my pocket.

                         SIMON
                   (pleased)
               Oh, my gosh.

                         MELVIN
                   (hands him bacon)
               Now we'll both call him.

                         SIMON
               Come on, sweetheart...

                         MELVIN
               Yo, yo, yo...

     Verdell goes like a bullet to Melvin... who is totally
     surprised and staggered by the implications. True love and
     such.

                         SIMON
               Would you leave now, please?

                         MELVIN
               Stupid dog.
                   (to Simon)
               I don't get it.

     He exits...   looking apologetically at Simon in stoic ruin.

62   INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT             62

     Carol in bed on the pullout sofa... She is in turmoil...
     there is THUNDER, but no rain. She walks to the kitchen. She
     is trembling as she drinks a glass of water and exits.

63   INT. BEVERLY BEDROOM - NIGHT                             63

     The room is on an air shaft and this is where Carol shares a
     closet with her mother, who is now asleep.

     Carol quietly extracts a dress from the closet, leaving her
     nightgown on the floor. There is something sexy here, the
     woman in Carol churning. She plops on a summer dress -- no
     time for underwear.

64   EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT                             64

     Carol seeing a bus and dashing after it.

                                                            55.


65   EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - TWO AM                           65

     Carol crossing to Manhattan. She looks as if she's on her
     way to some final exam where she has no notion of the
     subject.

66   EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NEAR MELVIN'S BUILDING -     66

                         NIGHT (RAIN)
               Hot summer night as she gets off
               the bus and now the rains come...
               We are in a familiar neighborhood.

67   ANGLE ON MELVIN AND SIMON'S APARTMENT HOUSE              67

     As Carol consults the slip of paper with the address on it.

68   INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT (RAIN)          68

     As she enters building and realizes it's not just that she's
     wet -- the thin summer dress is a winner in any wet T-shirt
     contest... the fabric clinging to her breasts, like the old
     movie poster of The Deep.

69   INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT       69

     As Carol passes Simon's door... stands in front of Melvin's
     apartment -- twists herself to ease nervousness and knocks
     on the door... then RINGS the BELL. Finally Carol hears
     MUFFLED THROAT CLEARING on the other side of the door.

                            CAROL
               Uh, Udall?

                         MELVIN (O.S.)
               Carol the waitress?

                            CAROL
               Yes.

     As we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her breasts
     and gasps. She grasps the fabric and holds it straight out
     just as Melvin opens the door. His hair is static city,
     standing on end as he periodically gives it self-conscious
     pats.

                         CAROL
               The doctors had your billing
               address. I'm sorry about the hour.

                         MELVIN
               I was working... can't you just
               drop me a thank-you note?

                                                         56.


                     CAROL
          That's not why I'm here...
              (tearing suddenly)
          ... though you have no idea what
          it's like to have a real
          conversation with a doctor about
          Spencer...

                    MELVIN
              (very uncomfortable)
          Note. Put it in the note.

                    CAROL
          Why did yo do this for me?

                    MELVIN
          To get you back at work so you can
          wait on me.

                    CAROL
          But you do have some idea how
          strange that sounds??? I'm worried
          that you did this because...

She pauses -- the beginning of an extraordinarily long
silence. Finally.

                     MELVIN
          You waiting for me to say
          something?
              (as she shakes her head)
          What sort of thing do you want?
          Look, I'll be at the restaurant
          tomorrow.

                    CAROL
          I don't think I can wait until
          tomorrow. This needs clearing up.

                    MELVIN
          What needs clearing up?

                    CAROL
              (strong and true)
          I'm not going to sleep with you. I
          will never, ever sleep with you.
          Never. Not ever.

Melvin's reaction? Well, he'll never get credit for the
brief but intense inner struggle -- the struggle not to
scream --

                                                           57.


     -- not to cry -- to process the sudden and stunning hurt
     during his half turn away from her -- and then answer
     hoarsely.

                         MELVIN
               I'm sorry. We don't open for the no-
               sex oaths until 9 a.m.

     Carol is amused, surprised... maybe, in some small way ever
     taken by his style... but top priority is clarity.

                         CAROL
               I'm not kidding.

                         MELVIN
               Okay!!!! Anything else?!?

                         CAROL
               Just how grateful I am.

     Her mission completed -- she turns.

                         MELVIN
               So you'll be at work?

                         CAROL
               Yes.

70   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                            70

     It's a 3:22 a.m. as the two digital clocks on Melvin's night
     stand tell us... He gets up -- the first time we've seen
     his waking routine -- taps one foot on the floor twice --
     then the other foot -- two more taps and his body angles
     from the bed in a deliberate way.

     He is having anxiety. He sits at the piano and plays very
     briefly... Stops -- wipes some sweat from his forehead...
     Walks to his computer room -- turns the light on and then
     quickly off... Walks to his refrigerator...

71   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN, INSIDE REFRIGERATOR -    71

                         NIGHT
               As he grabs a cardboard take-out
               box...

72   INT. NEW YORK APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY/SIMON'S APT.         72

     He knocks of Simon's door...   It opens quickly.

                                                           58.


73   SIMON'S APARTMENT                                       73

                         MELVIN
               I took a chance you were up.

     Simon walks painfully back to a chair.

                         MELVIN
               I brought you Chinese soup.

                         SIMON
               Thanks.

                         MELVIN
               I have never been so tired in my
               life. Okay, if I sit here?

                         SIMON
               Got any easier questions?

     Melvin sits and moans -- the dog sitting near him.

                         MELVIN
               I haven't been sleeping. I haven't
               been clear or felt like myself. I'm
               in trouble. Some son of a bitch is
               burning my bridges behind my
               back... But the tiredness --
               boy... Not just sleepy.

                         SIMON
               But sick -- nauseous -- where
               everything looks distorted and
               everything inside just aches --
               when you can barely get up the will
               to complain.

                         MELVIN
                   (brightening)
               Yeah...

     He feels a touch of community and not knowing where to take
     it from here.

                         MELVIN
               I'm glad we did this.

     He rises and makes an awkward exit.

                         MELVIN
               Good talking to you.

     He exits -- Simon puzzled and concerned.

                                                           59.


74   INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                          74

     Carol seated working on a letter... She is trying to express
     her gratitude... An enormous sheaf of completed pages sit
     next to her... She is so involved she doesn't even look up
     as a young man, SEAN, knocks on the door and is let in by
     Beverly.

     They exchange greetings and move inside where we faintly
     hear Spencer greeting him... We MOVE IN and read over
     Carol's shoulder -- ""I'm sorry to have gotten sloppy and
     emotional in this letter, but it would have been on my
     conscionce (sic) forever if I didn't tell you how gratefull
     (sic)... ""

                         BEVERLY
               You're not still writing that thank-
               you note?

                         CAROL
               I'm on the last page. How do you
               spell conscience?

                         BEVERLY
               C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean
               from the bakery to baby-sit so
               let's go out.

                         CAROL
               I still don't feel safe leaving
               Spencer with someone. How do you
               spell it again?

                          BEVERLY
               Spencer is okay. You'd better start
               finding something else to do with
               your free time. If you can't feel
               good about this break and step out
               a little...
                   (struts and pumps her
                    arms)
               You ought to get Mr. Udall to send
               you over a psychiatrist.

                          CAROL
                   (more emotionally than
                     she intended)
               I don't need one 'cause I know
               what's really going on here. I have
               to finish this letter or I'll go
               nuts.
                   (looking at paper; weepy)
               This can't be right -- con-
               science.

                                                      60.


Carol breathes heavily -- gets control, stopping herself on
the brink of crying.

                    BEVERLY
          Carol. What?

Carol is amazed at herself... that she might not be able to
stem the flow... wide-eyed with apprehension, she looks at
her mother, who, in return, only nods permission for Carol
to let it go. A last defiant snort from Carol -- and then
she is overwhelmed. The headline comes first.

                    CAROL
          I don't know... It's very strange
          not feeling that stupid panic thing
          inside you all the time. Without
          that you just start thinking about
          yourself -- and what does that ever
          get anybody. Today, on the bus
          there was this adorable couple and
          I felt myself giving them a dirty
          look -- I had no idea everything
          was...

                      BEVERLY
          Go ahead.

                     CAROL
               (great, forceful hand
                gestures)
          ... moving in the wrong
          direction... Away from when I even
          remembered what it was like to have
          a man to... anything... hold
          fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for
          Christ's sake. I was feeling like
          really bad that Dr. Bettes is
          married.
               (this next one's tough)
          Which is probably why I make poor
          Spencer hug me more than he wants
          to... Like the poor kid doesn't
          have enough problems. He has to
          make up for his mom not getting
          any.
               (weeps at her insight)
          Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?

                    BEVERLY
          Spencer's doing fine. So what are
          you saying, that you're frustr...

                                                           61.


                         CAROL
               Leave me be! Why are you doing
               this? Why are you picking at my
               sores... What is it that you
               want?... You want what? What's with
               you? I hope getting me thinking of
               everything that's wrong when all I
               want is to not do this has some
               purpose.
                   (puffy; red; furious)
               What is it, Mom? No kidding.

     Slumped, fought out -- Carol gets out one last, naked husky
     voiced question.

                         CAROL
               What is it you want? What?

                         BEVERLY
               I want us to go out.

     A beat, then.

                         CAROL
                   (simply)
               Okay.

75   INT. CAROL'S APT, SPENCER'S ROOM, HALLWAY - NIGHT       75

     As they enter, still wiping away the effects of their cry.

                         CAROL
                   (to Sean)
               We're going out.

                          SEAN
                   (looking at their red
                    eyes)
               Looks like fun.

     She kisses Spencer -- almost getting involved in what he's
     doing -- then sees her mother waiting.

                         CAROL
               Okay -- we're out of here. I love
               you.

     Spencer nods -- involved with Sean. CAMERA FOLLOWS Carol as
     she exits the apartment -- her mother leading. Halfway down
     the stairs, she stops and reverses herself, going back to
     the apartment which she re-enters -- then to her son to ask:

                         CAROL
               Do you love me?

                                                              62.


                         SPENCER
               Uh-huh.

     Carol exits.

76   EXT. STREET - NEAR CAROL'S BLDG. (MOVING) - DAY            76

     Beverly and Carol walking past the store windows. A simple
     and unprecedented experience in their recent lives.

                         BEVERLY
               Nice to get out, isn't it?

     Carol nods tightly... then they wrap arms around each other
     and continue walking, turning into a corner bar.

77   INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON CAROL - DAY             77

     As Carol stands nervously while Lisa finishes reading her
     letter. In the b.g. Melvin and Frank are seated at the same
     table and in earnest conversation. Lisa keeps flicking away
     tears -- a few drops on the pages.

                         CAROL
               Don't get it wet.

     Lisa brushes the paper -- finishes and embraces Carol.

                         CAROL
               So it's okay?

                         LISA
               You almost have me liking him. You
               sure come from the heart. I never
               knew what you went through with
               everything.

                         CAROL
               I wanted him to know how much he'd
               done.
                   (looking over)
               Can you believe he's eating with
               someone.

78   ON MELVIN & FRANK                                          78

                         MELVIN
               It's not my dog and this Simon
               seems to have enough on his mind --
               but he did throw up twice and his
               spark is off.

                         FRANK
               Sure -- take him to the vet.

                                                      63.


                    MELVIN
          I did. And his stomach is out of
          whack. So they need him for a
          couple of days.

                    FRANK
          Do it.

                    CAROL
          Melvin.

She self-consciously hands him with the thick envelope.

                    MELVIN
          What's this?

                    CAROL
              (sotto)
          A thank-you note for what you did
          for me.

He hands it back to her deliberately. She takes it and walks
back to the service area where, embarrassed, confused, and
messed with -- she tosses the note.

After Carol leaves...

                    FRANK
          She's nice.

                    MELVIN
              (to Frank)
          Really nice. Shouldn't that be a
          good thing... telling someone, 'no
          thanks required.'

                    FRANK
          It looks like it really went over.
          You're sure making the rounds.
          Simon says you brought him soup
          last night. I hope he doesn't write
          you a note.

Melvin looks up -- wary -- his brain sends a disturbing
message.

                    FRANK
          What?

                    MELVIN
          ""What?"" Look at you... You sense a
          mark.

                                                64.


                    FRANK
          Hey -- you called me... I...

                    MELVIN
          About a dog.

                    FRANK
          Yeah, but it's all about Simon
          now... you helped with the dog...
          And now there are other things. I'm
          just as concerned as you are about
          Simon.

                    MELVIN
          Concerned. I'm just the hall
          monitor here.

                    FRANK
          It's not only financial assistance.
          What he's got to do is go to
          Baltimore tomorrow and ask his
          parents for money. It's not going
          to happen on the phone.

                    MELVIN
          Yeah. If his parents are alive
          they've got to help -- those are
          the rules. Good.

                    FRANK
          Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high
          maintenance selling painter coming
          through... So I'm out. Can you take
          him?

                    MELVIN
          Think white and get serious.

Carol enters scene.

                     FRANK
          Take my car -- a convertible. Do
          you drive?

                    MELVIN
              (loudly)
          Like the wind but I'm not doing it.

                    CAROL
          Getting loud, getting loud.

                    MELVIN
          He wants me to take his car and his
          client to Baltimore.

                                                      65.


                    CAROL
          I want your life for a minute where
          my big problem is someone offers me
          a free convertible so I can get out
          of this city.

She exits. Frank prepares to depart.

                    MELVIN
          Okay. I'll take him. Get him packed
          -- ready -- tomorrow morning.

Frank stumbles back... self-satisfied, he relaxes.

                    MELVIN
              (excited)
          Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow.
          Let's not drag this out. We don't
          enjoy another that much.

                    FRANK
          If there's some mental health
          foundation that raises money to
          help people like you be sure to let
          me know.

                    MELVIN
          Last word freak.

Frank adjusts and exits... Carol approaches calling a ""good-
bye"" to him.

                    CAROL
          So. Anything else?

                    MELVIN
          Yes. I'm going to give my queer
          neighbor a lift to Baltimore.

                    CAROL
          Okay.

                    MELVIN
          Hey, what I did for you is working
          out?

                    CAROL
              (a breath; then)
          What you did changed my life.

She offers him the note.

                    MELVIN
          No... no thank you notes.

                                                      66.


                    CAROL
          Well, part of what I said in this
          entire history of my life which you
          won't read is that somehow you've
          done more for my mother, my son and
          me, than anyone else ever has...
          And that makes you the most
          important, surprising, generous
          person I've ever met and that you
          be in our daily prayers forever.

                    MELVIN
          Lovely.

                    CAROL
          I also wrote one part... I wrote
          I'm sorry... I was talking about I
          was sorry when I got mad at you
          when you came over and you told my
          son that he ought to answer back so
          I wrote that.
              (reading from the letter,
               Melvin wildly
               uncomfortable)
          I was sorry for busting you on
          that... and I'm sorry for busting
          in on you that night... when I said
          I was never... I was sorry and I'm
          sorry every time your food was cold
          and that you had to wait two
          seconds for a coffee filler...

Melvin wants to disappear but Carol is getting into it --
emotionally moved by her own words.

                    CAROL
          ... and I'm sorry for never
          spotting, right there at the table
          in the restaurant, the human being
          that had it in him to do this thing
          for us... You know what, I'm just
          going to start from the
          beginning... I have not been able
          to express my gratefulness to
          you... even as I look at the word
          ""grateful"" now it doesn't begin to
          tell you what I feel for you...

And finally Carol notes Melvin's mood and pauses.

                    MELVIN
          Nice of you... thank you.

                                                  67.


                       CAROL
          Thank you.

                    MELVIN
          Now I want you to do something for
          me.

She looks at him for a very strange, long beat.

                    CAROL
          Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say,
          ""what?"" I thought I said,
          ""what?""... What?

                    MELVIN
          I want you to go on this trip.

                       CAROL
          No, sir...

                    MELVIN
          I can't do this alone. I'm afraid
          he'll pull the stiff one eye on me.
          I need you to chaperon. Separate
          everything but cars. You said you
          liked convertibles. Now I'm on the
          hook.

                    CAROL
          The stiff one eye?

                       MELVIN
          Two days.

                    CAROL
          I can't. I work.

                    MELVIN
          You take off when you have to.

                       CAROL
          My son.

                    MELVIN
          Bettes tells me he's doing fine.

                    CAROL
              (no other way)
          Melvin, I'd rather not.

                    MELVIN
          What's that got to do with it?

                                                           68.


                         CAROL
               Funny, I thought it was a strong
               point.

                         MELVIN
               Write me a note and ain't she
               sweet. I need a hand and where'd
               she go.

                         CAROL
               Are you saying accepting your help
               obligates me!?

                         MELVIN
               Is there another way to see it?

                         CAROL
               No.

79   INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT      79

     Carol takes an old weekend case down from the top shelf of
     the closet.

                         CAROL
               Well, here's a little suitcase
               shocked that it's been used.

     She holds up a dress -- a pretty one... then decides it's
     too pretty and puts it back... Now she looks in another
     drawer and pauses as if she ponders one of the mysteries of
     the ages. She hesitates then talks to herself.

80   INSERT -- UNDERWEAR DRAWER                              80

     Her best underwear neatly stacked alongside her everyday
     ""girl Jockies."" She fingers the good stuff -- puts it back --
     then the everyday -- hesitates.

                         CAROL
                   (furiously exasperated)
               There's not way to pack for this
               trip... well, I'll tell you -- I'm
               not packing the camera.

     As she exits the room --

81   INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT                81

     As she picks up the phone.

                                                           69.


82   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT               82

     Melvin is in his bedroom -- everything he's taking neatly
     stacked on the bed waiting to be packed (he is taking a
     camera). He has a list of what he needs. All items --
     underwear, socks, etc... with four checks next to each one
     and still he -- checks each stack on the bed and adds
     another check. The PHONE RINGS. This is an amazing
     development. He has almost no recent experience with
     receiving a nighttime phone call. He makes a little comment
     to himself as he moves.

                          MELVIN
               Woo-woo.

     He stops -- briefly trying to remember where the phone is --
     and then, remembering, crosses and picks it up but before
     bringing it to his mouth nervously clears his throat.

                          ON CAROL
               As she hears his throat being
               cleared. It is not a pretty sound.
               (The following conversation is
               INTERCUT.)

                          CAROL
               Hello?

                         MELVIN
               Are you still coming?

                          CAROL
               Yes.

     Melvin visibly relaxes.

                         CAROL
               Melvin... I'd like to know exactly
               where we are going.

                         MELVIN
               Just south to Baltimore, Maryland.
               So I know what you're going to ask
               next.
                   (correcting himself)
               That you might ask -- I'm not
               certain.

                         CAROL
               There's... there's no need to bring
               anything dressy... or... I mean --
               I didn't know if we'd be eating at
               any restaurant that have dress
               codes.

                                                            70.


                         MELVIN
               Oh.
                   (a beat)
               We might. Yes. We can. Let's.

                         CAROL
               Okay, gotcha. What did you think I
               was going to ask?

                         MELVIN
               Whether crabs are in season there
               now...

                         CAROL
               Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good
               night.

83   INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       83

     Beverly looks up expectantly as her daughter enters.

                         BEVERLY
               How was it talking to him?

                         CAROL
               Stop treating this like I'm going
               away with a man. He's just going to
               say those crappy, sick,
               complaining, angry things to me. I
               hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's
               a freak show -- the worst person I
               ever met.

                         BEVERLY
               Well, maybe he has nice friends.

84   EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                    84

     Beverly and Spencer wait with her. The bus approaches. She
     kisses them.

                         CAROL
                   (to Spencer)
               You stand there and I'll wave to
               you from the back window.

     As she boards the bus.

                         BEVERLY
               Call me as soon as you're settled.

                         CAROL
                   (to Spencer)
               I love you.

                                                              71.


     The bus driver closes the doors on her -- she shoves them
     open.

                         CAROL
                   (to bus driver)
               Sensitive, huh?!

     The bus pulls out. He runs after the bus -- waving at his
     mother who grows concerned that he might be taxing himself.

85   INT. VETERINARIAN'S WAITING ROOM - DAY                     85

     A female VETERINARIAN in surgical scrubs holds Verdell as
     Melvin finishes filling out some forms.

     On opposite sides of the waiting room, a very large black
     dog and a tiny Chihuahua sit patiently with their owners.

                         VETERINARIAN
               Anything unusual in the dog's diet?

                         MELVIN
               No. Everybody gets their own cage?

                            VETERINARIAN
               Certainly.

                         MELVIN
                   (pointing to Chihuahua)
               Put him in with that one, not that
               one...
                   (pointing to large dog)
               ... Builds his confidence.

86   EXT. BUS STOP NEAR APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY     86

     Carol disembarks.

87   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY                   87

     As she walks and turns a corner.

     CLOSE ON CAROL

     The shot of the prisoner taking the walk toward the death
     chamber. But the prisoner -- has grit -- her knees do not
     buckle. She does not whimper. No prison ""screws"" will have
     to support her weight. Still, the prospect couldn't be
     grimmer.

                         CAROL'S POV
               Melvin next to a spiffy
               convertible. Top down. Trunk open.

                                                        72.


CLOSER ON MELVIN

He is wearing driving gloves and turns to witness the tussle
Frank and Simon are having just inside the building.

                    FRANK
          I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.

                    SIMON
              (upset)
          So am I, Frank.

Frank starts to leave -- Simon stops him. They embrace.

                    MELVIN
          Soak it up -- it's your last chance
          at a hug for a few days.

As Frank moves off Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor
changes... that quickly there is a shyness.

                    CAROL
          Hi.

                    MELVIN
          Thanks for being on time... Carol,
          the waitress, this is Simon, the
          fag.

                    CAROL
          Hello... Oh, my God, who did that
          to you?

                    SIMON
          I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked
          in on people robbing me. I was
          hospitalized. I almost died.

                    MELVIN
          Let's do the small talk in the car.
          Load up.

Carol puts her bag in the car.

                    MELVIN
          I was going to do that for you.

                    CAROL
              (taken aback)
          It's okay. No problem. Where should
          we sit?

                                                           73.


                         MELVIN
                   (totally non-plussed)
               I -- uh, I... Well, there is no
               place cards or anything.

                         CAROL
                   (to Simon)
               Let me go in back. You look like
               you need all the room you can
               manage.

                         SIMON
               That's very thoughtful.

                         MELVIN
               Never a break. Never.

     Carol steps into the back. Melvin disappointed that he's not
     sitting next to Carol... Carol is wedged in the small back
     seat. She struggles to get her feet in.

                         MELVIN
               You're really jammed back there.

     He reaches for the latch between his legs and slides his
     seat and, with some effort, wrenches it forward giving
     Carol more room and putting his right against the wheel. She
     is startled by the gesture.

                         CAROL
               Thanks, Melvin.

                           MELVIN
               Welcome.

     And off they go. Simon and Carol stunned by the manners.

88   EXT. 12TH STREET                                           88

     Turning onto Fifth.

                         MELVIN
               I got the whole ride programmed.

     CAMERA FOLLOWS as Melvin goes to a rack of CDs -- all
     carefully labelled. He selects and begins to play the one
     marked ""ICEBREAKER."" It is a song which we clearly and
     quickly judge as off the circumstances -- a quick burst of
     ""Y.M.C.A."" Melvin STOPS the MUSIC and chuckles.

                         MELVIN
               Just wanted to see what you'd do.
               No, we have greatness here.

                                                           74.


     He goes for another CD labelled ""FOR USE TO REP THINGS UP.""

     The car turns onto Seventh as we hear BEAUTIFULLY SELECTED
     MUSIC.

                         CAROL (O.S.)
               Hey, I like this music.

     And, as the MUSIC PLAYS, Simon looks out.

89   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                         89

     The three of them... Carol chattering away.

                         CAROL
               I don't know the last time I've
               been out of the city... Hey, my
               arms are tanning. I used to tan
               great. We gotta stop soon so'se I
               can check on Spencer.

                         SIMON
                   (during the above)
               I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I
               can't turn my head all the way
               yet... tell her we can't hear her.

                         MELVIN
               Doesn't matter. She's enjoying
               herself. Consider it part of the
               music.

90   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                         90

     A short time later. Carol is now driving.

                         CAROL
               I'm sure, Simon, they did something
               real off for you to feel this
               way... But when it comes to your
               partners -- or your kid -- things
               will always be off for you unless
               you set it straight. Maybe this
               thing happened to you just to give
               you that chance.

                           MELVIN
               Nonsense!

                         CAROL
               Anybody here who's interested in
               what Melvin has to say raise their
               hands.

                                                           75.


     Simon does not raise his hand. Simon and Carol have thus
     declared their majority.

                         SIMON
               Do you want to know what happened
               with my parents?

                         CAROL
               Yes. I really would.

                         SIMON
               Well...

                         CAROL
               No, let me pull over so I can pay
               full attention.

     Car pulling over toward parking spot.

91   EXT. HIGHWAY - CURBSIDE - CONVERTIBLE - DAY                91

     She takes the car curbside and parks.

                         CAROL
               Now go ahead.

     Simon looks back at Melvin as does Carol. He looks innocent.
     Several beats -- Melvin almost says something -- a hidden
     hand gesture from Carol stops him. Finally.

                         SIMON
               Well, I always painted. Always. And
               my mother always encouraged it. She
               was sort of fabulous about it
               actually... and she used to... I
               was too young to think there was
               anything at all wrong with it...
               and she was very natural. She used
               to pose nude for me... and I
               thought or assumed my father was
               aware of it.

                         MELVIN
               This stuff is pointless.

                         CAROL
               Hey -- you let him...

                         MELVIN
               You like sad stories -- you want
               mine.

                                                      76.


                    CARL
          . Go ahead, Simon. Really. Please.
          Don't let him stop you. Ignore him.

                    SIMON
          Okay. Well, one day my father came
          in on one of those painting
          sessions when I was nine -- and he
          just started screaming at her -- at
          us -- at evil. And...

                     MELVIN
              (very quickly)
          ... my father didn't leave his room
          for 11 years -- he hit my hand with
          a yardstick if I made a mistake on
          the piano.

                    CAROL
          Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked
          in on you and was yelling and...
          really, come on.

                    SIMON
          I was trying to defend my mother
          and make peace, in the lamest way.
          I said, ""she's not naked -- it's
          art."" And then he started hitting
          me. And he beat me unconscious.
          After that he talked to me less and
          less -- he knew before I left for
          college, my dad came into my room.
          He held out his hand. It was filled
          with money. A big wad of sweaty
          money.
              (gathers himself)
          And he said to me, ""I don't want
          you to ever come back."" I grabbed
          him and I hugged him... He turns
          and walked out.

Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as
strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so much
more complicated than her meat and potatoes troubles. She
looks out her window -- then kisses her fingers and touches
them to Simon's cheek. A nice, understated, gesture of
friendship.

                    CAROL
          Well, you know -- I still stay what
          I said. You've got to get past it
          all when it comes to your parents.
          We all have these horror stories to
          get over.

                                                           77.


     Melvin shifts INTO the FRAME.

                         MELVIN
               That's not true. Some of us have
               great stories... pretty stories
               that take place at lakes with boats
               and friends and noodle salad. Just
               not anybody in this car. But lots
               of people -- that's their story --
               good times and noodle salad... and
               that's what makes it hard. Not that
               you had it bad but being that
               pissed that so many had it good.

                         CAROL
               No.

                         SIMON
               Not it at all, really.

                         MELVIN
                   (a veteran's irony)
               Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to
               the hotel. And if you're lucky
               tomorrow Dad will give you another
               wad of sweaty money.

92   INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM/CARL'S ROOM - DAY           92

                         MELVIN
               Two bedrooms and the sofa opens...

     Carol is on the phone in the living room -- she hangs up.

                         CAROL
                   (to Simon)
               No answer... Maybe we should just
               drive there tomorrow. Can I have
               that one?

                         MELVIN
               Yes... sure.
                   (to Simon)
               I'll take the sofa.

     Carol walks into her room -- the nicest room she'll ever
     have slept in... She goes to the phone and dials...

                         CAROL
                   (into phone)
               Hello... Hi, Spencer... Why are you
               out of breath? You did?!? That is
               great... So great... So -- no, wait
               a second, Spence...

                                                              78.


93   INT. HOTEL SUITE - MELVIN AND SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY     93

     Melvin watches Simon struggle to unpack his especially neat
     suitcase. Melvin is uncomfortable.

                         MELVIN
               Can I ask you a personal question?

     Simon laughs loudly in apprehension squared.

                         MELVIN
               Do you ever get an erection for a
               woman?

                           SIMON
               Melvin...

                         MELVIN
               Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier
               if you were not...

                         SIMON
               You consider your life easy.

                         MELVIN
               I give you that one...
                   (eyes suitcase)
               Nice packing.

94   INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                       94

     Carol enters the common living room... Melvin is sitting
     there. Carol is dealing with a number of unsettling new
     factors in her life.

                         CAROL
               My son was outside playing soccer.
               I never saw him playing ball. Come
               on, you guys -- take me out for a
               good time... Take me out dancing.

                           MELVIN
               Dancing?

                         SIMON
               I can't, I'm exhausted.

     Carol walks to Simon and puts an arm on him. Melvin is
     visibly disturbed by her gesture.

                         CAROL
                   (to Simon)
               I don't blame you...

                                                           79.


               This is a monumental first day
               out... You sad or anything?

                         SIMON
               No... Nervous. It would be very
               rough, Carol, if you weren't along.

                         CAROL
               What a nice compliment.

     She gives Simon a kiss... Melvin deals with jealousy. She
     turns to him.

                         CAROL
               I'm happy. And you're my date.
               Let's get dressed.

     She exits the room. Melvin unnerved.

                         MELVIN
               I'm going to jump in the shower.
               I'll be right with you.

95   INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT                                95

     As Carol, dressed in a thrift shop find, enters the main
     room of the suite and hears the SHOWER running -- she sits
     down to wait -- through...

96   SERIES OF DISSOLVES                                     96

     Showing the enormous length of time which transpires until
     finally a seriously clean Melvin emerges from the bathroom
     through a cloud of steam. They exit.

97   EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT                      97

     As they drive up.

                         VALET
               Good evening, sir.

                         MELVIN
               They sell hard shell crabs here?

                           VALET
               Yes.

98   INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT                      98

     As they enters...

                         HEAD WAITER
               Good evening.

                                                            80.


                          MELVIN
                Hi. You have hard shells, right?

                          CAROL
                Stop asking everyone.

                          MELVIN
                Just him and that's it. Okay, you
                can answer -- we've worked it out.

                          HEAD WAITER
                Yes, we do... And I can give you a
                tie and jacket.

                          MELVIN
                What?

                          HEAD WAITER
                They require a tie and jacket but
                we have some available.

      He reaches into the coat and check room and withdraws them.

                          MELVIN
                No... I'm not wearing that -- and
                just in case you were going to ask
                I'm not going to let you inject me
                with plaque either.

                          CAROL
                You promised a nice place -- can't
                you just...
                    (to Head Waiter)
                You have these dry cleaned all the
                time, don't you?

                          HEAD WAITER
                Actually, I don't think so.

                           MELVIN
                    (to Carol)
                Wait here.

99    EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT                      99

      As Melvin takes his car back from the valet.

100   EXT. STREET - SHOPPING MALL - NIGHT                    100

      As the car goes right across the street to a shopping mall.

101   INT. SHOPPING MALL - MEN'S STORE - NIGHT               101

      Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly.

                                                            81.

                Good evening.

                          MELVIN
                I need a coat and tie.

                          OTHER ANGLE
                CAMERA REVEALS that the floor is
                intricately patterned so that
                passage for Melvin is impossible.

                          SALESMAN
                Come on in.

                          MELVIN
                No.

                          SALESMAN
                No?

                          MELVIN
                    (pointing)
                That jacket and give me a tie.

102   EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT                     102

      As he pulls up - a new VALET taking his car.

                          VALET #2
                Good evening.

                          MELVIN
                You have hard shells?

                          VALET #2
                I'm not sure.

                          MELVIN
                Everyone else says you do.

                          VALET #2
                Then I guess we do.

103   INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT                             103

      As he enters, looks for and then spot Carol. She is having a
      martini at the bar... Sitting on a stool -- watching COUPLES
      dance... Happy by herself... Turning down a MAN who wants to
      buy her another... And Melvin watches... Watches his date.

                          HEAD WAITER
                Shall I get her for you?

                                                      82.


                    MELVIN
          No, it's all right. I'll just
          watch.

He enjoys watching her for a few more beats... She turns --
Melvin makes a ""Haul your ass over here"" gesture... and she
smiles and walks toward him... A WAITER has lifted her drink
-- placed it on a tray and follows her. She takes a bit of a
slalom course through the tables, giddy as the MUSIC PLAYS
and couples dance in the b.g. She notices the waiter in her
trail.

                    CAROL
              (mouthing the words to
               Melvin)
          My drink is following me.

Melvin watches her approach. It is all too exquisite. He
takes a breath -- it doesn't come easily.

                    CAROL
          You look s...

She stops herself from saying ""sexy,"" regathers, then...

                    CAROL
          You look great.

They arrives at the table. He holds out her chair for her.

                    CAROL
          You wanna dance?

                    MELVIN
          I've been thinking about that since
          you brought it up before.

                       CAROL
                 (rising)
          And?

                     MELVIN
          No...
              (and before she can
                digest that)
          ... I don't get this place. They
          make me buy an outfit but they let
          you wear a house dress. I don't get
          it.

                    ON CAROL
          Melvin has no idea he has insulted
          her. Sandbagged in extreme, she
          gets up -- actually ready to leave.

                                                      83.


                    MELVIN
          No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean
          it. You gotta sit down. You can
          still give me the dirty look...
          just sit down and give it to me.

                    CAROL
          Melvin, pay me a compliment... I
          need one and quick... You have no
          idea how much what you said just
          hurt my feelings.

                    MELVIN
              (really pissed, mutters)
          That monominute somebody gets that
          you need them they threaten to go
          away. Never fails.

                    CAROL
          That's not compliment, Melvin...
          That's just trying to sound smart
          so I feel stupid... A compliment is
          something nice about somebody
          else... Now or never.

                     MELVIN
          Okay.

He waves her down.

                    CAROL
              (sitting)
          And mean it...

                    MELVIN
          Can we order first?

She thinks and then nods. The waiter is across the room.
This does not stop Melvin.

                     MELVIN
              (calling)
          Two crab dinners and pitcher of
          cold beer.
              (to Carol)
          Baked or fries?

                     CAROL
          Fries.

                    MELVIN
              (calling)
          One baked -- one fries.

                                                      84.


                    STARTLED WAITER
              (shouting back)
          I'll tell your waiter.

                    MELVIN
              (to Carol)
          Okay, I got a real great compliment
          for you and it's true.

                    CAROL
          I am so afraid you're about to say
          something awful...

                    MELVIN
          Don't be pessimistic. It's not your
          style. Okay... Here I goes...
          Clearly a mistake.
              (this is hell for him)
          I have this -- what? Ailment... And
          my doctor -- a shrink... who I used
          to see all the time... he says 50
          or 60 percent of the time a pill
          can really help. I hate pills. Very
          dangerous things, pills. ""Hate,"" I
          am using the word ""hate"" about
          pills. My compliment is that when
          you came to my house that time and
          told me how you'd never -- well,
          you were there, you know... The
          next morning I started taking these
          pills.

                    CAROL
              (a little confused)
          I don't quite get how that's a
          compliment for me.

Amazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion -- so
that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly -- then:

                    MELVIN
          You make me want to be a better
          man.

Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so slip
under her guard. She stumbles a bit -- flattered,
momentarily moved and his for the taking.

                    CAROL
          That's maybe the best compliment of
          my life.

                                                      85.


                    MELVIN
          Then I've really overshot here
          'cause I was aiming at just enough
          to keep you from walking out.

Carol laughs.

                    CAROL
          So how are you doing with those
          pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.

                    MELVIN
          Takes months to know... They work
          little by little.
              (holds his head; then)
          Talking like this is exhausting.

Carol moves to the chair next to him... She sits very close -
- he tenses.

                    CAROL
          Have you ever let a romantic moment
          make you do something you know is
          stupid?

                    MELVIN
          Never.

                    CAROL
          Here's the trouble with never.

                    TIGHT SHOT
          for the kiss. Their faces are close
          -- she looks at him... She closes
          her eyes -- her face moving toward
          him -- he is wide-eyed and
          afraid... His face almost moves
          away -- in a shot this close it's
          almost flight... But now his head
          moves back and he receives her
          kiss. It is brief. Carol smiles
          encouragement to him and herself.
          Melvin can't bear the pleasure.

                    MELVIN
          You don't owe me that.

                    CAROL
          That wasn't payment. When you first
          came into breakfast, when I saw you
          -- I thought you were handsome...
          Then, of course, you spoke...

                                                      86.


          So now that your soft li'l
          underbelly is all exposed. Tell me,
          why did you bring me?

Melvin's voice is soft -- hesitant, okay, vulnerable... as
he holds up his hands in a ""stop"" signal.

                    MELVIN
          Well, ah... that's a personal
          question.

                    CAROL
          Tell me even if you're scared. Tell
          me why you wanted me here. It's
          okay.

She kisses him again.

                    CAROL
          If you ask me... I'll say, ""yes.""

                    MELVIN
              (dissembling)
          There are lots of reason... I had a
          thought that if you had sex with
          Simon it might...

                    CAROL
              (humiliated)
          Sex with Simon?

                    MELVIN
          It's one idea...

                    CAROL
          That's why you brought me? Look at
          me! Is that really why you brought
          me... Like I'm a what and I owe you
          what?!

                    MELVIN
          I don't know why I brought you --
          that idea occurred to me is all...
          It came out first... Hey, you kiss
          him -- me... He says he loves you.
          You two hit it off. But you don't
          want to... fine... Forget what I
          said about sex with Simon. It was a
          mistake.

                    CAROL
              (wiping away tears)
          I'll never forget you said it.

                                                            87.


                          MELVIN
                It was a mistake.

      But she has already turned away and exits the restaurant...
      Melvin alone and miserable.

104   INT. SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                        104

      He finishes dialing. He is extremely tense -- not breathing -
      - a lump in his throat -- trying not to let the anxiety
      immobilize him... the NUMBER RINGS twice, then a humorless
      male voice:

                          PARENTS' VOICE
                    (humorless male voice)
                Hi. This is Fred Bishop...
                    (perky woman's voice)
                ... and Betty.
                    (Fred again)
                We are sorry to be unable to take
                your call right now. Please leave a
                message and we'd appreciate your
                including the time/date and purpose
                of your call.
                    (Simon mouths the word
                     ""date,"" then Betty speaks
                     before the beep Bye-bye.

                          SIMON
                Ah, this is Simon... I'm here in
                town...
                    (he waits)
                ... and, folks, you haven't come
                home later than 10 in your lives.
                Please pick up -- really... Okay...
                I'm going to call again in the
                morning. I need to see you. Or, at
                least get you to answer the phone.

      He hangs up. His parents want no part of him and he needs
      help.

105   INT. HOTEL SUITE - CAROL'S ROOM - NIGHT                105

      As Carol enters with some energy. We FOLLOW her as she goes
      into her room -- takes her suitcase, begins throwing things
      in.

106   INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - NIGHT                106

                          SIMON
                Hello... Hello???

      Carol thrusts open the door and enters...

                                                      88.


                    SIMON
          Was this supposed to be your room?

                    CAROL
          Our room. I don't want to see him
          and he's not going to come knocking
          on your door.

Simon struggles with his shirt -- she helps him,
inadvertently venting some anger as she does so.

                    SIMON
          Can you not be violent?

                    CAROL
          I don't think so. You need help
          with the pants?

                    SIMON
              (emphatically)
          No!!!

                    CAROL
          I'm going to take a big bath and
          order a big meal.

                      SIMON
          Uh-huh...

                    CAROL
          I'm sorry... are you okay?

                    SIMON
          Well, considering everything's
          horrible and tomorrow I have to
          face my parents... Don't ask me ...
          I'm sick of my own complaints ...
          got to get me a new set of
          thoughts.

                    CAROL
          Why? What have you been thinking
          about?

                    SIMON
          How to die, mostly.

                    CAROL
          Can you believe in our little mix
          you're the good roommate.

Simon laughs -- as she crosses to the bathroom and begins to
prepare a bath.

                                                               89.


                          SIMON
                    (turning off the light)
                Good night.

                          CAROL
                Good night.

      We are ON Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or
      sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he faces
      the bathroom and we have...

                           SIMON'S POV
                Carol sitting at tub's edge -- a
                towel around her and now as Simon
                looks at the bathing beauty she
                adjusts her hair -- the towel falls
                -- a better than perfect breast
                exposed...

                                                    BACK TO SCENE

                          SIMON
                    (a whisper)
                Hold it.

      He leaves the bed.

107   ANGLES ON HOTEL DESK                                      107

      What's he up to... he takes the blotter from the desk set
      and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair
      and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of the
      bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol.

                          SIMON
                I've got to sketch you.

                          CAROL
                No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer
                than you think. I give the wrong
                impression sometimes and...

                          SIMON
                I haven't even been thinking about
                sketching for weeks.

                          CAROL
                Stop staring. Do a vase.

                          SIMON
                But you're beautiful... your skin
                glows.

                                                            90.


                          CAROL
                Thanks. But I just want to take a
                bath and...

                          SIMON
                That long neck -- the line of
                you... you're porcelain... your
                back goes on forever. You're
                classic... you're why cavemen
                chiseled on walls...

                          CAROL
                All right, cut me a break.

      Simon's pen moves across the blotter -- Carol sees him
      earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision and then shyly but
      deliberately she lowers the towel. He's right. She's
      breathtaking.

108   INT. BAR - NIGHT                                          108

      Melvin sits alone, nursing a drink. He's been talking to the
      bartender.

                          MELVIN
                So then, the next thing I know,
                she's sitting right next to me, and
                then, well, it's not right to go
                into the details, but I screwed up.
                I got nervous. I said the wrong
                thing and if I hadn't, I could be
                in bed now with a woman who if you
                could make her smile you got a
                life. Instead, I'm here with you,
                no offense, a moron pushing the
                last legal drug.

      He sits there, just another Joe on a bar stool with his
      heart breaking.

109   INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - CLOSE ON SIMON - NIGHT109

      He's excited -- smiling... We hear Carol -- also revved.

                          CAROL (O.S.)
                I don't care how you put it --
                We're being naughty here, pal.

                          FULL SHOT
                Carol holding a pose for Simon...
                He is holding a ballpoint over the
                back of a hotel desk blotter. His
                style cramped by his cast.

                                                            91.


                           SIMON
                No. No. This is great, this is so
                great. I can't get the angle with
                this cast.

      He struggles with the cast, and then decides to struggle no
      more. Summoning remarkable strength, he rips a piece from
      the cast, freeing his hand -- he roars ironically -- a
      lion's roar of liberation. He is back at his center.

110   INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                      110

      Melvin is having a room service breakfast.

      The door opens... Simon enters. A new Simon -- better than
      ever, clearly happy -- a morning-after glow.

                          MELVIN
                Did you have sex with her?

      Carol follows his out. Her arms are filled with the hotel
      soaps, shampoos, etc.

                          MELVIN
                Sorry, didn't realize she was right
                there.
                    (a beat)
                Did you have sex with her?

                          CAROL
                To hell with sex.

      Carol looks at Melvin -- he can't meet her gaze.

                          CAROL
                We held each other. It was better
                than sex. What I need he gave me
                great.

                          SIMON
                I just love her.
                    (beat)
                How're you doing?

      Melvin reacts.

111   INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY                                    111

      Simon finishes dialing the phone... a brief wait, then:

                          SIMON
                Hello, hi, Mom -- I can barely hear
                you. Do you have to whisper?

                                                            92.


                No -- don't apologize -- it was the
                luckiest thing for all of us that
                you didn't answer last night... I
                can't hear you... okay, dear, just
                listen to me then.

112   ON MELVIN AND CAROL                                    112

      Melvin has been reduced to straight talk as Carol brings the
      bathroom bounty into the room and begins to put it in her
      suitcase.

                           MELVIN
                I get why you're angry. It's no
                snap to explain why I was like
                that, but let's not try to do it on
                the run...

                          SIMON
                ... so Mom. Truly no grudges --
                truly. A little odd that you didn't
                come to see me when you heard I was
                hurt, but the important thing I
                want you to know is your son is
                happy. I'm working again. I'll make
                do -- I don't want a thing.
                Wouldn't take it if it was offered.
                I'll drop you a note from wherever
                I land and then it's up to you. I
                hope we patch things up but know
                that if we don't, I wish you both
                the very best... I can't hear you.
                You heard me, though, right? Good --
                take good care. 'Bye.

      He hangs up, totally satisfied with himself and rips over to
      Carol and Melvin.

                          MELVIN
                ... Now he's going to want to stay.
                And they'll want to take a ride to
                the lake or whatever. So it's a
                good five hours back. It gives us a
                chance to take it easy and...

                          SIMON
                I'm going back with you.

                          CAROL
                But what about...

                          SIMON
                I'll take care of myself --

                                                      93.


                          MELVIN
                What are you talking about? You got
                real problems.

                          SIMON
                I know. I'm a little bit nervous.
                Suddenly everything seems so easy.
                Carol, a load has been lifted.

                          CAROL
                One night with me!

                          SIMON
                You think you're kidding.

      Melvin stalks out.

113   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                               113

      The car parked near a phone booth --

                          MELVIN
                    (to Frank over the phone)
                Aww Jesus! No choice.

      Carol walks up to Simon in the car.

                          CAROL
                I got a gift for you.

      She hands him a base ball cap.

                          MELVIN
                    (on phone)
                Nothing like no choice to make you
                feel at home.

                          CAROL
                    (to Simon)
                Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!

                          MELVIN
                Do it then. Get the dog picked up.
                I can't believe you let it stay
                there.

      Melvin hangs up the phone.

                          MELVIN
                Good-bye.
                    (to Simon)
                Well, your luck is holding. They
                sublet your place. You're homeless.

                                                             94.


                Frank's got a line on another place
                you can use for now.

                          SIMON
                Another place where?

                          MELVIN
                Does it matter?

      Melvin gets in -- goes to the glove compartment for a
      special CD labelled ""For Emergency Use Only."" As it PLAYS a
      confessional love SONGS:

                           CAROL
                I don't want to hear that music
                right now.

                          MELVIN
                What do you mean? You said you
                liked it.

                           CAROL
                I don't.

                          MELVIN
                This one has a special meaning.

                          CAROL
                It's your car but I don't want to
                hear it. If that means anything.

      Melvin hesitates and then turns OFF the SONG in mid-
      proclamation of love.

114   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - NIGHT              114

      As the car arrives... They get out...

                          MELVIN
                Here are the keys to my apartment.
                I'm going to park you in my place
                while I take Carol home.

                          CAROL
                    (hefting bag)
                I'll take a bus.

                          MELVIN
                I'll take you... why not?

                                                            95.


                          CAROL
                I don't care what you did for me. I
                don't think I want to know you
                anymore -- all you do is make me
                feel badly about myself.
                    (turning to Simon)
                You have my number.

                          SIMON
                    (hugging her)
                I love you...
                    (sotto)
                Let him take you home.

                          CAROL
                Don't want to. I love you.

      She shakes her head and walks off. Simon looking at Melvin
      with some sympathy.

                          MELVIN
                Don't say anything.

115   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT KITCHEN - NIGHT                115

      Where Verdell's ears prick.

116   INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT                                 116

      As they enter.

                          MELVIN (O.S.)
                I told you to go on in.

                          SIMON (O.S.)
                Look, I've got to get a hold of
                Frank and see where I'm hanging my
                hat 'cause...

      The door opens, revealing them:

                          MELVIN
                I think you gotta camp it here...

                          SIMON
                What are you talking about?

      The dog vaults toward them -- all else forgotten as the dog
      greets his two favorite people and they talk to him.

                                                               96.


                          SIMON
                    (to Verdell)
                I know the feeling -- you feel like
                your ol' self again, huh? -- Mommy
                and Daddy are home.

      Melvin reacts.

                          SIMON
                Sorry... You're fun to mess with.

      Melvin gets up... Simon notices some of his paintings.

                          MELVIN
                They took your place furnished.
                Jackie said she grabbed your
                personal stuff -- they were
                supposed to set you up here.
                    (leading the way)
                There's this extra room -- I never
                use. It gets good light. No other
                answer really.

      Simon follows.

117   INT. SIMON'S NEW ROOM - NIGHT                             117

      As they enter... the room clean and organized -- a small but
      lovely garret.

                          SIMON
                Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm
                me.

                          MELVIN
                They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?

                          SIMON
                I love you.

      Melvin looks at him finally -- pretensions fall.

                          MELVIN
                I'll tell you, buddy, I'd be the
                luckiest guy alive if that did it
                for me.

118   INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                            118

      As Carol unpacks, she gives gifts to her mother and Spencer.
      But clearly something gnaws at her psyche.

                                                            97.


119   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT              119

      Melvin's two digital clocks are two minutes apart... each
      around 1:55 a.m... He sits in a chair still fully dressed...
      forlorn... Verdell in his lap. A beat then we hear Simon's
      whispered voice.

                          SIMON (O.S.)
                Where is my big hairy boy?

      Melvin is alarmed. He stops breathing as his gay houseguest
      approaches.

                          SIMON (O.S.)
                Verdell, sweeties?

      Melvin breathes again. Simon enters the room.

                          SIMON
                Sorry, didn't know you were awake.
                I just thought Verdell shouldn't
                get too used to sleeping in here
                'cause then...

                          MELVIN
                Look, we both want the dog --
                and...

      The PHONE RINGS... they look at each other. Melvin doesn't
      move.

                          SIMON
                Should I get it?

      Melvin nods. Simon walks into the next room... several beats
      as he finds the phone. We hear him pick it up and:

                          SIMON (O.S.)
                Hello.

                           ON SIMON
                SIMON
                     (into phone)
                Hello. It's me. He took me in. Did
                you know? Hold on, I'll get him for
                you.

      He walks back to Melvin's room.

120   INT. MELVIN'S ROOM - NIGHT                             120

      As he enters.

                                                            98.


                          SIMON
                It's Carol.

      Melvin is quickly out of his chair -- the dog in one mitt...
      he thrusts it at Simon.

                          MELVIN
                Here. Take the dog.

      As he speeds him out...

                             SIMON
                Good luck.

121   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT          121

      As Melvin picks up the phone... He clears his throat loudly.
      Following is INTERCUT between Carol and Melvin -- the first
      such CUT showing Carol blasted by the throat clearing.

                             MELVIN
                Hello.

                          CAROL
                Yeah... Well...

                          MELVIN
                    (very concerned)
                How you doing?

                          CAROL
                I can trust my brain.

                          MELVIN
                That seems like a good choice.

                          CAROL
                I don't know whether I'm being
                sensible or hard on you.

                          MELVIN
                The two might go together.

                           CAROL
                See. There's an example. I don't
                know whether you're being cute or
                crazy now.

                          MELVIN
                    (what the hell)
                Cute.

                                                            99.


                          CAROL
                You don't have to answer everything
                I say. Just listen to me. Okay?

      He nods his head, ""yes.""

                          CAROL
                It's really something that you're
                looking after Simon. And what I
                said on the street. That was a bad
                thing to say. And it made me sick
                to my stomach. It was a bad thing
                to say. And I'd be lying if I
                didn't say that I enjoyed your
                company... but the truth is you do
                bother me enormously and I know --
                think -- that it's best for me to
                not have contact with you because
                you're just not ready and you're a
                pretty old guy to not be ready...
                and I'm too old to ignore that. But
                there were extraordinary kindnesses
                that did take place. So thanks for
                the trips...

      She's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than
      ever. It's hard to know whether to die or not.

                          MELVIN
                Okay to say something now?

                            CAROL
                Go ahead.

                          MELVIN
                I should've danced with you.

                          CAROL
                Okay. Good-bye.

                            MELVIN
                So long.

      Carol hangs up. She feels strange. A shoe hasn't dropped.
      Oh, hell... she missed him.

122   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT          122

      Melvin walks in anxious circles in the living room. He is
      impatient.

                          MELVIN
                You going to come talk to me or
                not?

                                                        100.


                    SIMON
          I'm coming.

We enters the room carrying Verdell who strains to be
allowed closer to Melvin. Simon releases him.

                    SIMON
          What did she say?

                    MELVIN
          I'm a great guy --
          ""extraordinary""...
              (before Simon can
               celebrate)
          ... and she doesn't want contact
          with me.
              (a beat)
          I'm dying here.

                     SIMON
          Because...
              (gently)
          ... you love her?

                    MELVIN
              (sharply)
          No... and you're supposed to be
          sensitive and sharp.

                    SIMON
          Okay... you tell me why --
              (mimics him)
          ""You're dying here.""

                    MELVIN
          I don't know... Let me sleep on it
          and figure it out.
              (then)
          Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to
          what I had... She's evicted me from
          my life.

                    SIMON
          Did you like it that much?

                    MELVIN
              (furiously)
          It was better than this... Look,
          you, I'm very intelligent. If
          you're going to give me advice or
          conversation or consolation or
          hope, you got to be better than
          you're doing.

                                                   101.


          If you can't be at least
          momentarily interesting than shut
          the hell up. I'm drowning and
          you're describing water.

                    SIMON
              (getting pissed)
          Picking on me won't help.

                    MELVIN
          Well, if that's true then I'm
          really in trouble.

                    SIMON
          But you know where you're lucky?

                    MELVIN
          Absolutely not.

                    SIMON
          You know who you want. I'll take
          your seat any day. So do
          something... don't sleep on it...
          go over there. I don't think
          anybody should ever sleep on
          anything -- it's not always good to
          let things calm down.

                    MELVIN
          Hey... I'm charged here. But she
          might kill me for showing up this
          late.

                    SIMON
          Then get in your jammies and I'll
          read you a story... I think you've
          got a chance. The only real enemy
          you have is her ability to think
          logically -- the best thing you
          have going for you is your
          willingness to humiliate yourself
          if it gives you one chance in
          whatever -- so go catch her off-
          guard.

                    MELVIN
          Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.

He moves for the door... stops suddenly, jolted.

                    SIMON
          What's wrong?

                                                            102.


                          MELVIN
                I forgot to lock the door.

123   EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING (CAROL'S NEIGHBORHOOD) -123

                          NIGHT
                As he parks. He exits the car --
                now wary... looks at his watch...
                hesitates... walks reluctantly into
                the apartment house.

124   INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT     124

      As Melvin looks at Carol's doorbell with great uncertainty.

125   INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                          125

      Carol in a cotton wrap-around dress/bathrobe... sitting
      directly in front of a fan... the windows open, reading one
      of Melvin's books...

      There is the briefest possible sound of a DOORBELL...
      someone has jabbed her downstairs button ever so briefly --
      so briefly that she's not certain it's her DOORBELL -- until
      the same brief sound REPEATED... She walks to her wide open
      window and looks over.

                          HER POV
                The convertible at the curb.

                                                 BACK TO SCENE

      She hesitates --

126   INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT     126

      As Melvin gives up and starts out... turning as the sudden
      blast of being BUZZED into Carol's life sounds. He bolts for
      the door and enters.

127   INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                          127

      She opens the door... she hears the sound of MELVIN SOUNDING
      HEAVILY up the stairs... He reaches her side.

                          CAROL
                What do you want, Melvin?

                          MELVIN
                Were you asleep?

                          CAROL
                What do you want?

                                                       103.


                    MELVIN
          'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm
          sorry. And you could be grouchy.

                       CAROL
          Grouchy?

                    MELVIN
          ... 'Cause of being woken up, and
          it would make my job impossible. So
          then I wouldn't even try.

                       CAROL
          What job?

                    MELVIN
          Were you asleep?

                    CAROL
          What are you doing here?

                    ANOTHER ANGLE
          Beverly in the hallway looking on --

                                             BACK TO SCENE

                    MELVIN
          I'm sorry I woke you -- some other
          time.

He half turns to leave.

                    CAROL
          I wasn't asleep!!

                    MELVIN
          What a break...

                    CAROL
              (losing it a bit)
          Is it a secret what you're doing
          here?

                    MELVIN
          I had to see you...

                       CAROL
          Because...

                    MELVIN
          It relaxes me... I'd feel better
          just sitting on the curb in front
          of your house than anyplace else I
          can think of or imagine.

                                                        104.


Carol has not ever heard anything like that before... it's
sort of sexy in its sincerity.

                    ANOTHER ANGLE
          As we see in the b.g. that Beverly,
          standing near her door down the
          hallway, has heard at least this
          last part...

Melvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone...

                     MELVIN
              (serious)
          Wait a minute, I'm overstating
          here, maybe the inside stairs. I
          don't want to sit with my feet in
          the gutter. What does that serve?
          It only...

But suddenly Carl is shouting to the heavens.

                    CAROL
          Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal
          boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here.
          Just a regular boyfriend who
          doesn't go nuts on me...

                    BEVERLY
              (butting in)
          Everybody wants that, dear -- it
          doesn't exit...
              (as Carol turns to her)
          Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.

She disappears into her room. Carol snorts a laugh --
gathers herself. A beat.

                     MELVIN
              (hopefully)
          Boyfriend?

                    CAROL
          Oh, come on in and try not to ruin
          everything by being you.

                    MELVIN
          Maybe we could live without the
          wise cracks.

She looks at him -- then:

                    CAROL
          Maybe we could...

                                                              105.


      Melvin glances at the cracked pattern of Carol's kitchen
      linoleum and stalls at the door.

                          MELVIN
                It feels a little confined here.
                Let's take a walk.

                          CAROL
                See. It's four in the morning. A
                walk sounds a little screwy to me,
                if you don't mind.

                          MELVIN
                If you need an excuse, there's a
                bakery on the corner. There's a
                shot it'll open soon -- that way
                we're not screwy -- we're just two
                people who like warm rolls.

                          CAROL
                Okay.

128   EXT. STREET - NEAR BAKERY - NIGHT                         128

      They walk quietly -- Melvin still walking with his usual
      attention to where he steps.

                           CAROL'S POV
                Melvin walking -- and though we can
                see an improvement -- it is still
                decidedly strange as he
                conspicuously avoids stepping on
                the lines.

                                                    BACK TO SCENE

      Carol sighs. It is the sound of possibilities crashing down.
      Melvin looks at her -- embarrassed, self-conscious -- his
      habits making him appear unworthy.

                          CAROL
                    (gently; almost lovingly)
                I'm sorry, Melvin -- but whatever
                this is -- is not going to work.

                          ON MELVIN
                He takes this hard. It forces him
                to half-whisper something he hasn't
                at all said to himself... given his
                history... this is an extraordinary
                intimacy.

                                                     106.


                    MELVIN
          I'm feeling... I've been feeling
          better.

                    CAROL
          Melvin, even though it may seem
          that way now -- you don't know me
          all that well...
              (as he scoffs)
          I'm not the answer for you.

She starts to turn. He tugs at her arm. As she turns back to
him.

                    MELVIN
          Hey, I've got a great compliment
          for you.

                    CAROL
          You know what? I...

                    MELVIN
          Just let me talk.
              (gathers himself with
               uncertainty, then:)
          I'm the only one on the face of the
          earth who realizes that you're the
          greatest woman on earth. I'm the
          only one who appreciates how
          amazing you are in every single
          thing you do -- in every single
          thought you have... in how you are
          with Spencer -- Spence...
              (he has reached her)
          ... in how you say what you mean
          and how you almost always mean
          something that's all about being
          straight and good...

                    ON CAROL
          She stands on the precipice of
          being transported away from the
          logic which has been her lifeline.

                    MELVIN
          I think most people miss that about
          you and I watch wondering how they
          can watch you bring them food and
          clear their dishes and never get
          that they have just met the
          greatest woman alive... And the
          fact that I get it makes me feel
          great... about me!

                                                     107.


              (a real question filled
               with concern for her)
          You got a real good reason to walk
          out on that?

That last question clearly a true question, not the least
rhetorical -- she considers her answer, then:

                    CAROL
          No! It's certainly not. No -- I
          don't think so. No.

                    MELVIN
              (tentatively)
          I'm gonna grab you.
              (with conviction)
          I didn't mean it to be a question.
          I'm gonna grab you.

He kisses her. An awkward bomb of a kiss. They separate. A
tense beat. Then:

                    MELVIN
          I know I can do better.

They embrace again. He does indeed do much better. A first-
class smooch. CAMERA MOVES DOWN to see his foot land
squarely on a crack in the sidewalk without his knowledge.
They break -- look at each other without a notion of where
to take it from here, and the ALMOST in unison begin to walk
away FROM CAMERA, Melvin following a path that avoids
cracks. Suddenly the lights of the bakery turn on as it
opens for business.

                    CAROL
          Warm rolls...

They walk to the bakery, Melvin avoiding the cracks. As they
enter the bakery, a WORKER moves toward them to clean the
entranceway. Melvin, forced to step back onto a crack, this
time notices -- registers the momentous fact and joins Carol
inside as we:

                                                FADE OUT

                            THE END

- I'm so...
- I'm so glad you called.
I'm so glad
you were free.
God,
I love your eyes.
Okay, now what?
Cup my balls.
- Okay, yes.
- All right. I can do that.
- Oh! There it is.
- There we go.
That feels good.
You know what to do.
Okay, you know what?
Slow it down, slow it down.
Okay.
Slow it down.
There we go.
How's that?
That's good, nice and slow.
See? Doesn't that feel good?
Yeah.
No, I want to go fast.
You want to go fast?
Fast.
Yeah. No...
Oh, yeah.
That feels good.
Oh, Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
You know what?
I think...
I think maybe
we are on different
rhythms here.
I was having a nightmare.
I was so scared.
Good morning.
You look beautiful.
No, I'm sure
I look terrible.
I just woke up.


                               Page 2/101

Are you kidding?
I'm sure I'm a mess.
You slept over.
I did.
I thought we had
a rule against that.
Oh.
I'm kidding.
Oh.
That was funny.
I'm kidding.
You're funny
in the morning.
I like hanging out
with you.
Oh. Yeah.
I love hanging out with you.
I think we get
along really well
and you're so sexy.
I know.
I just have a lot
coming up at work
and I don't want
to make promises
I can't keep.
You know what I mean?
I know you do.
Yeah.
We're on the same page.
I'm not looking for
a relationship right now,
either. Let's just say that.
Whatever you wanna...
I can do...
I'd rather just...
I like simple...
I'm not like other girls.
I'm not like,
""Be my boyfriend!""
Unless you were like, ""Yeah!""
Then I'd be like,
""Maybe.""
Mmm. But let's not.


                                Page 3/101

I don't want that either.
Wow, this is so awkward.
I really want you to leave,
but I don't know how to say it
without sounding like a dick.
Come on!
Hands behind your heads!
Let's go! Sit-ups!
You're looking
like pieces of bacon
on a plate.
It's disgusting!
I smell the fat!
- He scares me.
- Me, too.
But he's
an excellent motivator.
That's true.
What are you looking at?
Oh, Shit, he sees us.
Oh, God.
Hey! Hey!
If you want to
take this class,
you're going to
have to pay for it
like the rest
of these bitches!
What, are you dancing?
In the park...
Dance class?
You are not dancing.
You are not
dancing in the park!
- Go, go, go, go!
- Freeloaders!
I'm coming over there.
- Is he coming?
- I'm coming after you!
Sorry, Rodney.
We're on a budget.
- Oh, come on!
- It's only 12 bucks!
Oh, my God!


                                 Page 4/101

Come on!
You fucking freeloaders.
We are out
of our minds.
I know.
That's okay.
I'm so glad that
we got to do this.
I feel like I haven't
seen you in forever.
Mmm. I've been
in Chicago a lot.
I know.
Sleeping at Dougie's house.
Well, it's just
closer to work.
How is it going
with him anyway?
I don't know.
I mean, it's fine,
but I just feel
like he's been
distant lately.
And I don't know...
He calls me
""dude"" a lot.
That doesn't mean anything.
I think everything is fine.
I don't know.
Anyway,
what did you
do last night?
Umm...
What did you
do last night?
You are not
telling me something.
I hung out with
Ted for a little bit.
I knew it!
We had fun.
It was fun.
Here's what I
don't like about it.


                              Page 5/101

You hate yourself
after you see him,
every time.
And then we go through this,
and then you feel like shit,
and it's almost
like you're doing it
because you feel
bad about yourself.
He called me late,
and we hung out.
It wasn't a big deal.
And you know what?
It was fun.
Ew! You had
sex with him.
We had an
adult sleepover.
Ooh. Did you let him
sleep over in your mouth?
Annie!
I'm sorry!
You're unbelievable.
He kept putting
it near my face.
They do that,
don't they?
Why do they do that?
Let us offer.
If we don't offer...
Please.
You're supposed
to slap it away.
I couldn't.
You don't want to
look right at it.
No.
It's too aggressive.
It's like...
""Hello.""
That's my impression.
Those are the balls?
Yeah.
I'm trying to make it round,


                               Page 6/101

but I can't
because I have elbows.
He is so hot, though.
Look, I know
you say he's cute
and all that stuff,
but it makes you feel
like shit, you know?
You're a total catch,
and any guy
would be psyched
to be your man.
You should just
make room
for somebody who
is nice to you.
You know what?
He's honest!
He told me that
we are what we are
and we're just having fun.
And I like that.
He also told you that
you need dental work.
He's an asshole.
I don't need dental work.
You're right.
There is nothing
wrong with my teeth.
You are so beautiful.
Will you marry me?
Yes.
I love you.
I don't want to
go to work today.
Mmm-mmm.
Let's see how many
times Terry's called me.
Oh! Only 15!
You know what, Terry?
I don't want
to pick up your
monkey lamps.
Sorry!


                             Page 7/101

Monkey lamps?
Ugh. I cannot wait
to never work for
a psychopath again.
Oh! Annie!
I'm sorry. I should
have gone down Mason.
Well, I'm the genius
that opened a bakery
during the recession.
They were good cakes,
Annie.
Thank you.
Come on. Look away,
look away, look away.
Do you have any
ideas of styles?
Oh, I don't know.
What do you think, honey?
Whatever you want.
Look at how you guys
are making this
decision together.
That's sweet. You guys
love each other, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ohh! That's sweet.
That will go away.
You cannot
trust anybody, ever.
Especially someone
you're in a
relationship with.
'Cause they're
living with you,
you don't
know who you're
sleeping next to.
It is scary.
I mean, look at him.
He may not even be Asian.
It is scary.
So did you guys


                            Page 8/101

want to look at
these engagement rings?
We're going to browse.
Okay, sure.
I'll be here.
Thank you.
What was that about?
Umm, nothing.
They had to run.
They had to go somewhere.
And no wonder.
You're selling
lifelong happiness.
You're not telling everyone
about your problems
and how your
boyfriend left you,
and maybe marriage
will work out.
Show me your
""love is eternal"" face.
No, that's two years,
four years tops.
That is not eternal.
Kahlua, can you
come over here
for a second, please?
What's up, Don-Don?
You make up
the best nicknames.
You don't need
a nickname because
Kahlua is so delicious.
Don't sue me
for touching you.
Show Annie your
""love is eternal"" face.
That looks like you
have menstrual cramps.
Thank you so much,
Kahlua.
Now, why can't you
be more like Kahlua?
Look, I'm trying


                              Page 9/101

really hard.
You've just
got to try harder.
The whole reason
you have got this job,
Annie,
is because your mom
is my sponsor in AA,
and I'm doing her a favor.
I understand.
Oscar, get back to work.
You shouldn't be
behind the counter.
Andrew,
you are not the father!
That's great. Yeah.
Stop that.
Don't do that.
Hey, Brynn.
Oh, hey, roomie.
Guess what
happened to me today.
Hmm. What?
I got a free tattoo.
You did what?
I could not believe it.
The guy said,
""Do you want a tattoo?""
Just a random...
Yeah, opened up
the side of his van.
No.
He said, ""it's for free!""
And I said, ""Sure.""
You said yes?
Yeah!
Yeah. Look.
See here?
What is it?
See that?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Brynn!
It's a Mexican drinking worm.
It's a Native American


                                Page 10/101

symbol meaning ""wasted.""
Okay, Brynn,
just so you know,
it's...
Gil, hi.
Hello. How are you?
Have you seen
your sister's tattoo?
It's really infected.
Better get
a little bit of ice on it.
Yeah, a little bit.
Stick some
frozen peas on there.
Yeah. It can't hurt.
All right.
So, I just wanted
a quick word.
You know that
tomorrow the rent is due.
I was getting my check,
and I wondered
if I could get
your check, too?
Yes.
I'm getting
the money.
It's been
a little slow.
You have to
keep it in the bag
and put the bag on it.
So, the check?
Yes. Yes.
Yeah.
Because it's a kind of,
like, ""needing it
today""-type situation.
It's coming.
- Who is it?
- Me!
Who is it?
Oh, my God.
Hurry up, your creepy


                             Page 11/101

neighbor asked me
if I wanted to
watch the news again.
Sorry.
He is so gross.
- Please, come on in.
- Let me take your magazines.
Welcome to the magazine
and wine party. Ooh!
Have a seat.
I'm very happy
that you are here.
What?
Because I want
to eat an apple.
Would you like
some apple?
What is that?
I got engaged.
What?
He asked me last night.
What?
I know!
That's why he's
been acting so weird
'cause he's a terrible liar,
and he thought he
was gonna blow it.
He was ignoring
me and I thought
he was going to
break up with me.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh!
I know!
Lil!
I'm shocked, still.
But I'm happy.
Can you believe this?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I just got hot.
You did?
Are you okay?
Yes. My pits


                                Page 12/101

are sweating.
My stomach hurts. I'm hot.
What does that mean?
Oh, my God!
What is happening?
I don't know.
I'm wearing a ring.
I can't believe it.
Lil, you're getting married.
I'm getting married.
And you'll be
my maid of honor.
God, of course I will!
It will be super fun.
It's gonna be really fun.
Yeah. You know,
we can plan
everything together.
My God!
Planning your wedding...
Are you sure
you're up for it?
I know it's a lot to ask
and to put on your plate.
And you're going
through a tricky time,
and you're super-busy...
Stop.
It's a lot to ask.
Stop.
Okay.
It's fine. And I'm
more than happy to do it,
and it's not too much.
Oh! Look at that.
It's my fianc?calling.
Oh, your fianc?
Hi, baby,
what's up?
it's Annie.
I just told her!
Yeah, she's so happy.
No, I'm not!
""Yay,"" she said.


                               Page 13/101

What, baby?
I know,
I miss you, too.
Yeah,
I'll meet you in an hour.
I love you, too.
Wow.
Wynonna Judd.
That's really good.
Painting those giant bangs
was a royal pain in my can.
And those teeth!
I should have
painted her mouth shut.
Can you just get dressed?
We're gonna be late
for the engagement party.
Oh, I forgot
to tell you, honey.
What?
Forgot to tell you.
What?
I signed up to
speak at AA tonight,
and I just have to.
Mom!
No.
I forgot. I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I keep telling you,
you're not supposed
to go to those things.
You're not an alcoholic.
Only because I've
never had a drink.
What?
They are inspiring.
There is this one story
I've just got to tell you.
Sit down.
Okay.
This gentleman
who started
blow-jobbing to get crack.


                              Page 14/101

His name is Marvin Johnson...
Mom, anonymous.
You keep... It's no names.
Okay, okay.
Forget it.
Marvin J. Whatever.
Too late.
Well, he became
a gay prostitute.
And he realized that
he had hit his bottom.
And I have been thinking,
honey,
that maybe this
is your bottom.
I'm telling you,
hitting bottom
is a good thing.
Because there's
nowhere to go but up.
Right?
Yep. That's what you say.
Yeah, a positive message.
Yeah.
Yeah. Thanks for
the pep talk, Mom.
Honey. Anytime, anytime.
All right. I guess I'm
going to Lillian's party
by myself, then.
Don't talk to me
about being by yourself.
I go everywhere
by myself.
Thanks to that
new whore, Barb.
Mom, come on.
No, I don't like to say it.
They've been
married 12 years.
Okay.
But she's still a whore.
I'm sure she greets
him in the evening,


                                Page 15/101

beaver first.
I don't want to
think about that.
I bet she got that car
by giving your dad
something sexually.
'Cause there was
one thing I would
never do,
and I'm sure Barb
is a champion at it.
I don't want to know.
It's called
a ""chicken coop.""
Of course it is.
You start at the back
and you peck your way
to the front like
you have a beak.
And then you end up
with two eggs
in your mouth.
That's gross.
Well, I'm sure
your dad likes it.
Of course,
he grew up on a farm.
Okay.
You sure you don't
want to move in with me?
Mom, thanks,
but no way.
No way in hell.
Yeah?
No, thanks.
Think about it.
Okay.
You don't need
your own place.
Yeah, I Kind of do.
Okay.
All right,
I'm going to go.
All right.


                           Page 16/101

Holy shit.
Ohh. Valet. Perfect.
Sorry.
Needs a wash.
You have to
punch it a few times.
Annie!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God,
Lillian.
I know.
This is your
engagement party.
Isn't that crazy?
It's so beautiful.
I can't believe
Dougie's boss
is a member here.
I know,
and his parents, too.
And Dougie, I guess.
Gosh, and me,
I guess, too, now.
Come on, let's go
say hi to the rest
of the bridal party!
You remember
my cousin Rita?
Rita.
Annie.
I haven't seen you
since you
graduated high school.
She has
three kids now.
- Three boys.
- They're so cute.
They are cute,
but when they
reach that age,
they are disgusting.
They smell,
they are sticky,
they say things


                         Page 17/101

that are horrible,
and there is semen all
over everything, okay?
Disgusting.
I cracked
a blanket in half.
Do you get where
I'm going with that?
I do.
I cracked it
in half.
What?
Annie,
this is Becca,
my friend from work.
We are in
the trenches together.
Hey. it's great
to meet you.
Hey, how are you?
Nice to meet you.
This is my husband,
Kevin.
Hi.
""Husband.""
I like to say it.
We are newlyweds.
Wow. Congratulations.
Thank you so much.
We went on
a sweetheart honeymoon.
Oh.
Where did you guys go?
Disney World.
Disney World.
We finish each
ether's sentences.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Is this your husband?
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't know him.
I'm sorry.
Do you want to go


                          Page 18/101

for a walk later?
Oh. I can't.
All right.
I can't. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm not with anybody.
I'm here solo.
Let's start it again.
I'm Becca.
Rewind.
This is my husband.
You don't have a husband.
Sorry.
And this is
Dougie's sister, Megan.
- Hey.
- Hi.
My grandma is not
supposed to have wine.
I'll be right back.
Hey.
Hey. How is it going?
It's going great.
It's going great.
I'm on the mend.
I just got some
pins in my legs.
Believe it or not,
pins in my legs,
I can still do this. Right?
I fell off a cruise ship,
but I'm back.
Oh, shit.
Yeah, ""Oh, shit.""
Yeah, ""Oh, shit.""
Took a hard,
hard, violent fall.
Kind of pin balled down.
Hit a lot of railings,
broke a lot of shit.
I'm not going to
say I survived,
I'm going to say I thrived.
I met a dolphin down there.


                              Page 19/101

And I swear to God,
that dolphin looked
not at me,
but into my soul.
Into my goddamn soul, Annie.
And he said,
""I'm saving you, Megan.""
Not with his mouth,
but he said it,
I'm assuming, telepathically
We had a connection
that I don't even
know if I can... Jesus.
Hey, shut my mouth.
Look at... Unbelievable.
You must be Annie's fella.
I'm Megan.
It's a pleasure.
He's not...
I'm not... He's not...
I'm not with him.
Sorry.
All right.
I'm glad he's single,
because I'm going to
climb that like a tree.
Okay. You have
to meet Helen.
There she is. Helen.
Come here!
Helen, this is Annie.
Hi!
Ohh!
There she is.
Maid of honor.
So lovely to meet
Lillian's childhood friend.
You are so pretty.
You are so cute!
You are so sweet.
Helen is married
to Dougie's boss,
Mr. Harris. Perry.
Perry. And they


                               Page 20/101

are so close now,
they are literally
joined at the hip.
Which is good,
because so are we.
I know.
I'm so glad you guys
are finally meeting.
I know. Me, too.
I know. it's lovely.
Well, excuse me,
I better go check on
the hors d'oeuvres.
But it was great
to finally meet you.
It's a great party.
- Enjoy.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
She's great, isn't she?
She's awesome.
And I really
look forward to having
Doug as part of our family.
So much so
that you two should
get married right now
and save me
a shitload of money.
Dad.
Everybody always
laughs at that,
but I'm not joking.
I'm not joking.
Anyway, I want
to thank all of you
for coming.
And here's to Doug and
my baby girl, Lillian.
Cheers!
Cheers!
- I love you, Dad.
- Enough of me.


                              Page 21/101

Let's get the maid
of honor up here.
All right.
Annie?
Umm. Hi.
I'm Annie Walker.
Yay, Annie!
I'm not going to go
on with a big speech,
so I'll just say this.
I'm so happy to be
a part of this celebration.
And you two
deserve each other,
as well as
a lifetime of happiness.
- Thank you.
- Cheers.
- Love you guys.
- Cheers.
Thanks, Annie.
Cheers.
Thank you, Annie.
That was so sweet.
Thank you.
Lil, remember that trip
we took to
Miami with the boys?
And they were
working the entire weekend,
and we just sat
and drank wine
and ate peanut brittle.
And I shared things with you
that I've never
shared with anyone.
And you made me realize
how I can trust people again.
So let me just say,
Lillian,
you are my best friend.
And I'm
so proud of you.
Sorry. And, Dougly...


                                Page 22/101

I'm sorry, inside joke.
You better not
keep my Lil on a leash
because I still
need my drunken
Saturday nights
at Rockin' Sushi, okay?
Everybody raise your glasses
to the couple of the decade,
Doug and Lillian.
Have a great night.
Dessert wine is out.
Dessert wine, yummy.
Excuse me.
Umm...
I just wanted to
say really quick that
you are so special
to me, because...
Well, one of the reasons is
because I've known you
my whole entire life.
And you've really
helped shape who I am.
I just want to thank you
for carefully selecting me
as your maid of honor.
I know you had
some other choices,
but you are like my sister,
and I love you.
Well, that concludes
the speeches for the night.
Thank you.
One last thing.
It's rare to meet
someone as an adult
who you really connect with,
and that's you, Lil.
I went to Thailand recently
with my husband, Perry,
and there is
a beautiful saying
that I learned there.


                               Page 23/101

It means,
""You are a part of me,
""a part that I could
never live without,
""and I hope and I pray
that I never have to.""
And that's it for tonight.
Thank you for coming.
Really quick,
Thank you all for coming.
I just wanted to
say really quick...
Dessert wine is out.
Consuelo?
Really quick.
Speaking of Consuelo,
Lillian and I took
Spanish together in school.
And so, I would just
like to say to you,
and to everyone here...
Thank you.
Thank you.
I feel so close to you
and can trust you.
You are my
angel and soul mate.
And I feel I can
communicate with you
with simply a look.
Thank you for coming.
Here, I'll take that.
I'll take that.
Yep, I got it.
Lillian...
Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can
always count on me
For sure
That's what friends are for
In good times and bad times
I'll be on your
side forever more
That's what friends are for


                              Page 24/101

That's what
friends are for
Man,
engagement parties rule.
It made me feel awesome,
like I can go out
and catch another
dude to marry.
So, what's up with her,
anyway? With Helen?
What?
I'm just like...
I don't know.
She's in your wedding
and you've only
known her eight months,
though, right?
Come on.
Get it out,
get it all out.
I'm just...
Like, the whole gown,
and the...thing.
It's just weird, right?
You know what?
She's actually
really cool, Annie.
She's really...
She's a good one.
I'm telling you.
Well, I'm sure if you
like her, I will like her.
You have to just
get to know her.
Yeah.
Which I think
you really should.
And... Will you
just do me a favor?
Would you just hang
out with her once,
just the two of you.
All right?
As a favor to me.


                             Page 25/101

Okay, I will.
I love you, Annie Lou.
I love you, too.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh. Hi, I'm Helen.
You live in Milwaukee?
I'm sorry.
Have you met Lillian?
She's my best friend.
Yeah, I know.
We've only known each other
for five minutes.
Oh! Oh!
on! Cute.
No. No. Come on.
See? Okay?
I'm not drunk. I told you.
So, you are just
a terrible sober driver?
Ha ha. Very funny.
Can I stop walking now?
You can stop walking
when I tell you
to stop walking.
Hey, look.
If I was drunk,
would I be able to do this?
Stop it. Stop it.
Please, stop.
Please, stop.
I believe you.
You are not drunk.
But I'm still gonna
have to give you a ticket.
What? why?
It's a funny thing
about brake lights.
You have to have them.
I knew it.
God, those have
been out for a year.
I'm so stupid.
Look, please.


                              Page 26/101

Please, I promise
I will get them fixed.
This week, I promise.
Please. Do you have
to give me a ticket?
Yes. License
and registration,
please.
Thanks.
Look at that,
you live on
Wynnewood Drive.
Yep.
We are neighbors.
I just live
over on Ashley.
Ahh.
I used to work on Ashley.
You did? Where?
I had a bakery
on the main part
of the street there.
Oh. Cake Baby.
You are Cake Baby!
Yeah!
Yeah, you had your sign.
It was your face.
Yeah!
That was you?
That was me.
You made good cakes.
Thanks.
You used to make these
little pastry things,
and you'd put
something in them,
like a cream or a custard...
Cream puffs.
Cream puffs,
that's what you call them.
Delicious.
I used to get served
by this tall, broad guy,
with, like, a wormy face.


                               Page 27/101

Yeah, that was my boyfriend.
Sorry.
No, no. It was...
He was my boyfriend,
and then he left me
when the business
went under. So, anyway...
You're kidding?
What a dick.
I'm glad
I never tipped him.
You know what?
Let's forget about this.
Let's just
forget this one.
Really?
Under one condition.
What? What?
Get your
taillights fixed...
I promise.
I promise I will.
I promise. Thank you.
...Before you kill someone.
I'm not going to
kill anybody.
All right.
Here, there's your ID.
And I'm going
to give you this.
It's a buddy of mine.
He has a body
shop in Milwaukee.
He'll fix those
right up for you.
Bill Cozbi?
Yeah, with a ""Z.""
Different guy.
Yeah.
And don't mention
the whole ""Bill
Cosby"" thing to him.
It drives him nuts.
I mean it.


                               Page 28/101

Okay, I get it. Thanks.
You know what?
If you mention my name,
that I referred you,
he'll give you
a particularly
good deal.
My gosh. Thank you.
I really appreciate it.
Thanks.
Okay. Well,
I appreciated your cakes.
So, we are even.
That's me, there.
Rhodes. Officer Rhodes.
That's really
nice of you.
Thank you.
We are not all bad.
What?
I was just saying,
we are not all bad!
Oh. Yeah.
Actually, the rest of
them are, but not me.
I'm the best of them.
Okay. Thank you.
Anyway.
Thank you.
I didn't know
you played tennis.
Yeah, I played
a little in
high school.
I'm so glad we
were able to do this.
I'm really glad we
could do this, too.
It's nice we get to hang out.
I know, right?
Yeah.
It's too bad
Lillian couldn't play
with us today.


                                Page 29/101

Poor thing, she is so busy.
Ohh. I know.
But she's not really
that into sports.
Even when we were little,
she didn't like anything
that was too competitive.
She certainly enjoys
playing tennis now.
It's funny how
people change, isn't it?
Yeah. I mean, I don't know.
Do people really change?
I think they do.
Yeah, but, I mean,
they still stay
who they are, pretty much.
I think we change
all the time.
I think we stay the same,
but grow,
I guess, a little bit.
I think if you are growing,
then you are changing.
But, I mean, we are changing
from who we are,
which we always stay as.
Not really,
I don't think so.
I think so.
I don't.
Annie! These are my kids.
Step-kids.
Step.
They are so hilarious.
Funny.
Excuse me,
my husband's kids.
What are
you guys up to?
Going to the snack bar.
Awesome. You need
a ride home later?
Fuck off, Helen.


                               Page 30/101

Okay. Put a quarter
in the swear-jar.
Good to see you.
They are so cute.
Sweet kids.
Carol!
Get your shit together, Carol!
Yes!
I've seen better
tennis playing in
a tampon commercial.
Umm...
I've been thinking, and...
Brynn needs to start
paying rent. That's it.
She's been here
long enough.
The three of us live here,
it's not fair for
me to be paying half.
We split it three ways.
What do you say?
Well, she can't work.
She's on a tourist visa.
Yeah. So, technically,
I'm only allowed to tour.
Well, you know...
I have no way
of earning money,
unless I just
go and prostitute
down on the street.
I don't want you
to do that, no.
""Hello, fellas.
Here I am.""
Yeah, but we...
""Put your American sausage
""in my English McMuffin.""
No, we did that.
All right.
Okay, I don't even know
what you're
talking about any more.


                                 Page 31/101

There's three
people living here.
Yeah.
If she doesn't
start paying...
I'm not.
...she has to leave.
Is this about
the diary again?
What diary?
Your diary proved
very interesting to read.
You read my...
You read my journal?
At first, I did not know
that it was your diary.
I thought it was
a very sad,
hand-written book.
What? That does not
make any...
But, because of
the deep personal details
and the bits that
mentioned Gil and Brynn...
No, no, no, no.
- Don't read my journal!
- And the crumbs.
Then...
Don't go in my room!
Well, hello! I think,
before you make
those sort of demands,
you need to,
maybe, think about
putting a note on
your door saying,
""Do not come into my room,
read my diary and
wear my clothes.""
Wow, I've never been
to this part of town before.
Look, you can get
your checks cashed


                               Page 32/101

next door.
I know it looks
a little scary
on the outside,
but the food
is really good,
authentic Brazilian.
I'm telling you,
this is where
Brazilians come to eat.
I got to say, Annie's
really good at this.
She always drags me
to the weirdest places
and the food is
always incredible.
And plus, you get
a lot for your money, too.
So that's good.
All right.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Whoa! Somebody
likes Brazilian food.
To my bridesmaids.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Cheers to Lil!
This is such a stone-cold
pack of weirdos,
and I'm so proud.
And I just want to toast
all of you ladies.
I'm so happy to
get to know you guys,
and happy to say
that I have four
new friends.
Absolutely. Cheers.
So, Annie,
do you have a date
for the wedding?
Um...
I don't... I don't think


                             Page 33/101

I'm bringing anybody,
I guess.
Please, can I
set you up? Please?
Annie, you can't go
to the wedding alone.
Please?
If you go alone,
people might think
you're a prostitute.
Maybe.
I'm sorry.
I hope that you're all hungry
What would you like?
Yeah, I'll have
some of that, please.
I'll start with this.
I'd say yes.
Hello, chicken.
This is crazy
good, ya'll.
Helen, aren't you
eating any meat?
It's not good
to eat a big meal
before a fitting.
I feel a bit
bloated, so...
Not me.
No?
No. Physically,
I don't bloat.
Lucky.
That is lucky.
It's a gift.
I can't wait to be married
for as long as you've been
married.
And to have kids.
And be a mom.
Becca?
Yeah?
The other night,
I'm slaving away,


                                Page 34/101

making a beautiful
dinner for my family.
My youngest boy
comes in and says
he wants to order a pizza.
I said, ""No, we're not
ordering pizza tonight.""
He goes,
""Mom, why don't you go
and fuck yourself?""
He's nine.
Okay, now that
Lillian's in the bathroom,
I just wanted to
talk to you guys about
the shower really quick.
I was thinking it
could be French-themed,
since she's always wanted
to go to Paris her whole life.
So I figured we
could bring Paris here
and have champagne
and little cookies.
They'd say ""Lillian
and Dougie"" on them.
We can dip them in
chocolate fondue,
and get cheese from
the nice part of the store.
I love that.
Good idea, Annie.
We can have
French invitations,
the whole thing.
Don't you think
that'd be nice?
That's adorable!
That's really cute.
Good. Great.
I don't know.
It's really cute.
But I feel like,
personally, the Paris theme's


                                 Page 35/101

a bit,
""Been there, done that.""
I just feel
like we can top it.
We should throw
some ideas around.
See if anyone else
has a theme they had in mind
or something
they'd been thinking of.
What about
a Pixar-themed shower?
And we all come dressed
as our favorite
Pixar character.
That, and I'll just
snowball on top of that,
also Fight Club.
Female fight club.
We grease up,
we pull in.
Lillian doesn't know,
so it's, ""Surprise!
We're going to fight!""
We beat the shit out of her.
She's not going
to forget that.
We just fucking attack.
Can I be honest?
No.
I'm at home with
three boys all day,
every day.
What about
the bachelorette party?
That's what's more important.
I've got a new tube top,
I want to cut the tags off.
I'd like to take
advantage of this opportunity.
Where are we going?
I'm going
to second her.
We'd better


                                 Page 36/101

blow this shit out.
Yeah.
That poor girl, Lillian,
who we're all here for,
is in the bathroom
probably bawling her
fucking eyes out.
Because she's realizing,
""Holy shit!
""I've got to spend
the rest of my life
with Doug.""
He's my brother. I love him.
But he is a fucking asshole.
I think we can all
agree on that, right?
We can...
We'll figure it out.
I mean, I can think of stuff,
and it will be great.
We just have to make sure
it's really, really special.
Belle en Blanc?
This is the place.
Great job, Annie.
Thanks.
Annie.
Belle en Blanc.
Reservation name?
I don't have one.
We're just here to shop,
just to try on some dresses.
Okay. Well, the next
available appointment
for bridesmaids'
fittings is in seven weeks.
Absolutely no walk-ins.
Whitney? It's Helen.
Helen Harris?
Yeah!
Hi!
Hi.
Oh, my God. Hi. Listen,
I'll buzz you right in.


                                Page 37/101

Great, thanks.
Okay.
Hello. Welcome, come in.
You look wonderful.
Great to see you.
Welcome to Belle
en Blanc, ladies.
- Welcome to heaven.
- Thank you.
Oh, man!
This is some
classy shit here.
Jesus, Megan!
I'm sorry,
I want to apologize.
I'm not even confident
on which end that came out of.
Whitney, back to you.
I'm sorry.
Anyway, take a look around.
Get to know the dresses.
If you need anything,
I'll be in my office.
Have fun.
Oh, my God.
It's a Fritz Bernaise.
Ladies, I...
Oh, my God!
I just don't think
we can do any better.
This is...
This is beautiful.
That is gorgeous.
It's unique,
it's special, it's couture.
This is made in France.
Helen, this is $800.
Are you kidding?
It's on sale.
Are you serious?
Oh, my gosh.
What a perfect combination.
You guys,
it was meant to be.


                                 Page 38/101

Oh. that's nice.
There's other dresses
we should be looking at.
Nope, not that one.
Lillian,
Lillian, look at this one.
Isn't this pretty?
Yeah.
It's really pretty
and sweet, and...
We don't want to
upstage Lillian
with a big fancy dress.
Maybe we should
just get something
kind of simple.
Oh.
Please do not worry
about upstaging me.
Because guess who
Helen is friends with
and who's
designing my wedding dress.
Lady St. Petsois JuJu.
I just sent my
measurements to France, y'all.
No, you didn't.
Where were you when I
was getting married?
Ladies, let's not decide
on this bridesmaids'
dress straight away.
Let's let
our bodies decide.
Try some things on
and have some fun, okay?
Yeah, let's have
some fun, girls.
Ladies,
start your ""engines.""
- Oh, yeah.
- Lil, Lil.
- Amazing.
- This is so cool.


                                 Page 39/101

Ladies. Ladies,
if I may interject.
I just want to say
you all look stunning.
That's a given. Head to toe.
But, sadly,
we need to agree on one.
Well, I mean, ladies,
you all look beautiful.
But I just think,
personally, the
Fritz Bernaise is just...
I mean...
it's a Bernaise.
This is
one of a kind.
I just...
I don't think
there is a question.
No. No question.
There might be a question.
I might...
I might have a question.
I think this
dress would look great
on everybody.
It's a great color.
It's a great length.
It's fun. You can twirl.
You can move in it.
You can spread
your legs apart.
And it's a great price.
This is designer as well.
Is anyone else hot?
It is like an
oven in here.
Okay, well,
maybe this might
help you decide.
While you gals were
in the changing room,
I happened to rustle up
a two-year-old Lady


                               Page 40/101

JuJu dress in storage.
I had Lillian put it
on so you could see
what you'll be
standing next to.
Lillian, honey.
My God.
Beautiful length.
Breathtaking.
Holy shit!
You look amazing.
That's a dress.
That dress is so pretty
it makes my stomach hurt.
Lillian,
- I don't know what to say.
- You look...
Megan, are you okay?
I think...
My dress was
probably just tight.
Oh, my God.
You got food poisoning
from that restaurant,
didn't you?
No, I had the same thing
that she had and I feel fine.
Oh, my... Okay.
Oh, no.
Why is this happening?
Nothing is happening.
Oh, my God.
I don't really care
which dress we get.
It doesn't matter to me.
I just need to get
off this white carpet.
Oh, God.
Okay. No,
not the bathroom.
Everybody go outside.
I'm serious!
There is a bathroom
across the street.


                                Page 41/101

I think everybody
has the flu.
Shit!
I need the toilet!
I need the toilet!
I need the toilet!
No!
No. No, Megan.
No! No!
Look away!
Megan, no!
Look away!
You don't look
very well, Annie.
I feel fine.
Are you sure?
It wasn't that
gray kind of lamb?
You ate a lot of
that weird chicken.
Was it that?
No. I'm...
I... I feel fine.
I think you'd just feel
better if you threw up.
I don't have...
I don't have to throw up.
I am so sorry.
Get away from me!
You're not sick?
No.
No?
In fact, Helen, I'm hungry.
And I wish I had a snack.
You're hungry?
I'm starving.
What did we eat?
The sink is a goner.
What are you doing?
It's coming out
of me like lava!
Oh, my God.
Don't you
fucking look at me!


                              Page 42/101

Hmm?
Jordan almonds.
These are great.
Thank you.
Better?
I was...
I was just hungry.
Yeah.
Annie, everybody
is really sick
from that restaurant.
But it wasn't
the restaurant.
No, no, no, no.
Lillian,
where are you going?
No.
I need a bathroom.
Lil!
No. No.
Lil, where are you going?
Be careful.
What are you doing?
It's happening.
It's happening.
- It happened.
- What are you doing?
It happened.
No. Don't you
dare ruin that dress!
Ohh. You're really
doing it, aren't you?
You're really
shitting in the street.
We'll just take five
of the Fritz Bernaises.
Thank you, Whitney.
They really do look better.
Right.
Thank you.
You okay?
I crapped
my wedding dress.
I crapped...


                              Page 43/101

I... I crapped
my wedding dress.
Lunch was fun,
though, right?
It was a good time,
all the girls together.
Is this a sign, Annie?
No. I'm just
going to pull over
really quick,
though, because...
What?
...My tire just
feels a little...
Where are you going?
My tire just feels
a little low.
I just want to check
my tire real quick.
Oh. Could I borrow
your razor, please?
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.
Have a good date.
Thank you.
Is the guy that
you're going out
with also over 40?
I'm not over 40.
Forget it.
Lift up your arm.
Point up.
Ow!
Sorry.
Hi.
Annie.
Pete?
Yeah.
Come on in.
All right. Thank you.
Oh. This is
my son, Tyler.
Hi, Tyler.
Hi.


                          Page 44/101

These things are
always so awkward.
Yeah.
I'm not really a setup guy.
Me, either.
But Becca spoke
so highly of you.
She had a lot of
really nice things
to say about you, too.
That's nice to hear.
I'm going to go upstairs,
throw on a couple
of finishing touches.
The babysitter's not here yet,
so just hang out with Tyler
and I'll be
right back down.
Okay.
Okay.
So, how old are you?
Do you watch movies?
Are you afraid of dying?
Hmm?
Are you afraid of dying?
Um...
I don't know.
I mean,
I guess everybody is.
I don't know. Why?
Because my mom is
going to kill you.
You're making me
uncomfortable.
Your hair looks burned.
Okay.
Are you going to make
a baby with my father?
I don't...
I don't know.
My grandma died
where you're sitting.
She died right here?
Right where your


                                 Page 45/101

underpants are.
You wanna
watch me dance?
Sure.
I can't do this.
Listen to me.
I miss you so much.
I'll come over right now.
Okay, I'm not over
you yet, that's why.
She's not even pretty.
I'm not doing it.
I can't. No.
What are you doing?
Did you eat one of those?
Did you eat
one of those?
I ate Saturday.
Okay. Oh, boy.
You know what?
Something's going
to happen to you.
I don't know what it is,
but something's
going to happen
to your body.
That was fun.
Oh, my gosh.
You know what I was thinking?
You should come with me
to Lillian's wedding, maybe.
Not like that.
Not like anything serious.
But just like
a fun time, you know?
We can get dressed up,
and we can go
dancing and have a drink.
It'll be fun, right?
No. I mean,
I don't want to make
you have to explain
to all those people
what our relationship is.


                                Page 46/101

That would suck for you.
Right?
Yeah. I guess so.
I'm just thinking of you.
Yeah.
No, it's okay.
I have someone else
I can ask, anyway. So...
Really?
Yeah.
Who?
Umm...
This guy, George.
George Glass.
Okay.
Who is this George?
He is a very hot, nice guy
who likes me a lot,
and would probably
love to be my date.
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, let me ask you this.
Can this George Glass
do this to you?
Probably.
You know what?
It's getting really late.
You should probably go.
I'm going to miss you so much.
Oh.
Annie Walker.
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
What brings you
in here so early?
I've just had a bad night.
Boy stuff.
Ohh.
Do you want me
to arrest anybody?
I could do that.


                                 Page 47/101

Actually... No.
Do you want to talk
to a cop about it?
We are just like priests.
Except we can
tell everybody
about it after wards.
Oh.
I won't, though.
Doesn't sound very inviting.
You want a carrot?
Right now?
Yeah.
I'll share.
I've got plenty.
Sure, I'll have a carrot.
Yeah?
Okay.
Ohh. Yeah,
that sounds rough.
It's going to
get better, right?
I wouldn't have
thought so.
You know, my sister
was a maid of honor
at our cousin's wedding,
and she found it so stressful,
her hair started falling out.
That's terrible.
Yeah.
It grew back,
but it was...
It was pretty gross.
Planning a wedding
should be fun.
You know what?
If I ever had a wedding,
I'd want everybody
to be stress-free.
I'd like it to be
like a carnival.
Like, people win prizes
for guessing


                                 Page 48/101

the bride's weight.
Dunk tanks.
Yeah.
You know?
Mmm-hmm.
You could have elephants,
and the bride and groom
can walk on
a little tightrope.
Okay, what you are
talking about there,
that's a circus wedding.
It's a totally different...
Right.
You missed it.
Yeah.
Hey, you know,
instead of stressing
out about this wedding,
you know what you
should be doing?
Setting up a new bakery!
Hmm.
No, I'm kind of
done with that.
What?
I don't do it any more.
All right.
Ew.
Oh!
You got the ugly carrot.
What?
There is one in every bag.
You have to eat it.
It's good luck.
I'm not eating this.
Yeah! I'll eat it.
It's the lucky carrot?
No, don't eat it!
Don't eat it. Don't eat it!
Well, don't litter!
I'll fine you.
I'm sorry.
You know what?


                              Page 49/101

Actually,
I'm going to pick it up.
It really bothers me.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm anal
about that kind of thing.
I didn't know that
you could be a cop here
if you weren't a citizen.
You can't.
No?
No. No, you can't.
But they made
a special dispensation
because I'm so
tough and strong.
Oh. Right.
And handsome.
Okay.
You're pretty...
You're pretty tough.
I am tough.
You're tough.
You're a tough cop.
Look. You're saying it,
but you're laughing.
No, you're...
You're...
You didn't let
me flex that time.
That was unfair.
I'm really tough.
So am I.
No.
Yeah. I could be a cop.
You think
you could be a cop?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Let's see.
You know what?
The sun is nearly up.


                            Page 50/101

Let's go and see if
you've got what it takes.
That's right.
Now, plant your feet.
Okay.
Good.
And take aim.
Now, put your left
hand behind your head.
Yeah. And just
drop your left hip.
I'm kidding. Put your
arms out straight.
Okay.
You want to hit the middle
of the license plate.
That's where you get
the most accurate reading.
Okay.
Okay, here we go.
You ready?
Okay.
Fifty-eight.
What's the speed limit?
Fifty-five.
Okay, they were all right.
We'll let them go.
You were born
to do this.
Look at you.
Okay.
All right,
here we go.
Sixty-three.
You are missing
some good ones here.
People are on
their way to work.
Why ruin their day?
Okay, watch this. 48.
Forty-eight.
How did you do that?
It wasn't!
Yes, it was.


                             Page 51/101

That's never happened.
Are you serious?
It was 48?
Yes, 48!
Yeah.
I'm so impressed.
I'm pretty impressive.
I'm very impressed by you.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Damn!
That was 91.
Yes. Can we go?
We can go.
Come on, hot dogger.
Let's get that fucker.
ANNIE; on, my God!
Oh, my God!
...Family lake house. Perfect.
Hello?
I just got your e-mail.
Lake house?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's
Lillian's parents' house.
We used to go there
all the time in the
summers and everything.
It's one oi..
A bachelorette in a cabin?
Wait. Can you..4
Hold that thought. Hold on.
Hello?
Fucking Helen. Hello?
Annie, it's Rita.
Hi.
Listen, I need a trip
that I can fantasize forever
so that I am able to
have sex with my husband.
That's why
I'm thinking Vegas.
Vegas?


                                 Page 52/101

Hang on. Hey!
Shut your filth y
fucking mouths! I'm sorry.
I'm surrounded by savages.
You know what?
I should probably run.
My other line is ringing.
You know, I can get cocaine
from my hairdresser.
Okay, bye. Hello?
Annie.
Yeah?
I'm so excited.
Helen just called.
She said we can go to Vegas.
You know...
Yeah, but we have to...
We have to fly there, and...
Okay, Annie, I know
you are afraid of flying,
but I want to see Criss Angel,
but I'm scared.
Which I sort of love.
Can you just hold on
for one second?
Oh, sure, sure, sure. I...
Thanks. Hold on.
God damn it.
Hello?
Hey, Annie, it's Megan.
Hey.
I just had some thoughts
about the bachelorette party.
Okay, here we go.
Easy-peasy. Vegas it is.
Helen called you,
didn't she?
Yeah, she got the jump on you.
I want balls in my face.
Honestly, I think it's Vegas.
I love puppets.
Balls.
I guess we are undecided.
I feel so bad Annie's


                                 Page 53/101

stuck back in coach.
I know, I offered
to pay for her
so she could sit
in first class,
but she said no.
She's too proud.
It was nice of you to offer.
No carry-on, huh?
No.
Yeah, I noticed.
I noticed you
didn't put anything
in the overhead bin either.
And I get it.
I get it. I want you to know,
protect and serve
Air Marshal-style.
What?
I don't want to
infringe on your privacy, man.
I just... I really appreciate
what you do for this country.
And I respect
the hell out of you.
That's great.
I'm not an Air Marshal.
I'm going to take a nap.
Awesome.
Cool.
I'll take the first watch.
I'm not an Air Marshal.
You don't need
to take a watch.
Okay.
I've got the first watch.
Please check
your seat belts
and that your seat backs
are in an upright
position before takeoff
Gosh.
I am really hoping
this flight is quick,


                                 Page 54/101

and we get there on
the ground safely.
I'm not a good flyer,
I'm sorry.
I had a dream last
night that we went down.
Yep. It was terrible.
You were in it.
What?
It sounds like
something's happening.
Annie, what are you
doing up here?
You are supposed
to be in your seat.
I know.
I'm freaking out
a little bit.
Ma'am, we're still ascending.
You're gonna need to
return to your seat.
Okay, I was just...
Annie, I have something.
Take two, you'll fall asleep,
wake up and we'll be there.
Here.
Ma'am, you're going
to have to return to
your seat, please.
It's fine.
Okay. All right.
- Ma'am!
- All right. All right.
Oh, my God, I feel terrible,
I should be sitting
back there with her.
I shouldn't be up
here in first class.
I feel like such a jerk.
Lil, this is
your weekend, okay?
You are
treating yourself.
Just relax.


                                Page 55/101

She will be fine.
She will make friends.
There is much more sense
of community in coach,
I promise you.
She'll be fine.
I can't believe
you've never been
with anybody else.
Just Kevin.
I'm sorry. I just...
Becca, I just can't
help but feel bad for you.
You don't even
know what you want.
I got to know where
you keep the gun, man.
I mean, is it ankle,
hip, lower back?
You don't...
Between the cheeks, do you?
No, I don't stick
a gun up my butt.
That's stupid.
I didn't say ""up.""
I just knew of a guy,
that guy did a lot
of undercover work.
And all I know is
he had tape marks
all up and down his cheeks.
That can't be true.
People don't keep
guns up their asses
because if you
needed to use it,
how are you going to get it?
He cut a hole in his pocket.
What?
In his back pocket.
You have got to get
something out of your ass
and you cut a hole in
the back of your jeans,


                               Page 56/101

you want to tell me
you can't get to something?
I don't have a gun
for you to put up my ass
to make your point.
I can put my Nano.
I will show you.
I will...
If you get me scissors,
I will cut
a hole in my pocket.
And you will
never find this again
until I want you to find it.
Kevin can only have sex
in bed, in the dark,
under the covers,
only after
we have showered
separately.
And sometimes,
by the time
we are finished
cleaning ourselves,
he's too tired.
And then I pretend I'm tired,
but I'm not tired.
I'm not tired. I'm not tired.
That's why every girl needs
those slutty college years.
To experiment,
get it out of your system,
find out what you like.
Excuse me, could I
have a glass of alcohol
when you get a chance?
Two double
Seven and Sevens.
Is that...
You will like it.
It's sweet.
I have to go
to the bathroom.
But I heard about


                                Page 57/101

a woman who went to
the bathroom on a plane.
She got sucked
into the toilet.
Sucked right in.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Yeah, I just think
that what you gave me
didn't really do anything.
I just have too much adrenalin
or something. But, thanks.
Why don't you take
my scotch?
It will just give the pill
a little kick that it needs.
Honestly,
I do it all the time.
Yeah?
Yeah, and I'm much
smaller than you,
so you'll handle it.
Well, thanks.
Yeah?
Okay.
Yummy?
Yeah, it's good.
You should just toss it back.
Don't waste any more time.
Okay.
Ohh. LOOK at that.
Okay, that'll do it.
That'll do it.
So you don't even
have sex any more?
No, I have sex constantly.
The sex is constant.
But he hasn't
kissed me in five years.
What are you doing
when you are
having sex, then?
Thinking about other things
and wishing it would stop.


                                 Page 58/101

You know, sometimes
I just want to watch
The Daily Show
without him entering me.
It's the Wet
Republic Ultra Pool.
No.
Are you kidding?
What is it again?
There is a bar in
the pool and a tiger.
What?
- it's crazy.
- It's Vegas at its best.
Wait a minute.
Is this that place
that was on The Real World?
Are you kidding me?
Oh, my God. It's...
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?
I'm good.
I'm so much more relaxed.
Thank you, Helen.
I just feel like
I'm excited,
and I feel relaxed.
And I'm ready
to party
with the best of them!
And i'm going to
go down to the river
Wow! It looks like somebody
is really relaxing now.
What are you guys
talking about up here?
We are going to
a restaurant tonight.
I know the owner, so...
You do?
Ohh. Helen knows the owner.
Uhh!
Big whoop.
Let's go take a nap.


                              Page 59/101

What do you say?
Miss, you cannot be up here.
Hello, grandpa.
I'm sorry.
I just want
to be here with
my friends,
because I'm
with this group.
The sign just went off.
Can't she stay up here
for a minute and just talk?
Absolutely not.
Coach passengers
are not allowed
up here in first class.
It's policy.
I'm sorry.
Ooh!
This is a very
strict plane
that I'm on.
Welcome to Germany.
Auf Wiedersehen, asshole.
All right.
Why don't you go lay down?
I'm going to go take a nap.
I'm tired.
I think it's a good idea.
Catch you on the flip side,
motherfuckers.
I'm sorry.
I'm leaving.
Thank you.
This should be open,
because it's civil rights.
This is the '90s.
Right. It's not.
You're in the wrong decade.
You are.
Okay, I am.
Thank you.
Holy shit.
What did you give her?


                               Page 60/101

Miss?
No. it's not me.
Yes, it is you.
Please go back
to your seat.
Yes, I am with him.
I am Mrs. Iglesias.
No, you are not.
You were just out here
and you put sunglasses on.
Out.
But I don't want to.
Sir, she can
have my seat, okay?
Everyone should
experience first class
at least once in their lives.
And Annie shouldn't
miss out just because
she can't afford it.
No, ma'am, I'm
afraid that's not allowed.
- Help me, I'm poor.
- No, listen,
we're a whole wedding party.
I'm the bride.
I'm getting married.
This seat is empty.
She's obviously nervous.
We'll calm her down and...
I understand.
But Claire is right.
Everybody,
go back to your seats.
Okay, you especially.
You have three seconds
to get back to your seat.
You can't get
anywhere in three seconds.
Well, you'd better try.
You are setting me
up for a loss already.
Thank you.
Whatever YOU Say, Stove.


                                Page 61/101

It's Steve.
""Stove.""
What kind of name is that?
That's not a name.
My name is Steve.
Are you an appliance?
No, I'm a man,
and my name is Steve.
You are a flight attendant.
That's absolutely
accurate.
You can close that.
Thank you.
Hey, not-Air Marshall Jon.
You want to get
back in that restroom
and not rest?
No, I have to get
back to my seat.
Yeah, you gotta
get back on my seat.
You get it?
Yeah,
I definitely
got it.
Oh-Oh. what's That?
I got to get back to my seat.
Could you just
move your leg, please?
I got to go.
Oh-oh.
Oh-oh.
Somebody found a souvenir.
You feel that
steam heat coming?
That's from my undercarriage
That can go up
and higher.
Okay.
Jon, get us a blanket.
No.
I got to take a whiz
and I'll be right back.
Cool.


                                Page 62/101

I don't want you to be
a big fuck-up like me.
How do you think I feel?
Like me.
You can still
turn it around.
No, don't.
Stop it!
You are more
beautiful than
Cinderella.
You smell like
pine needles and you
have a face like sunshine.
What?
Oh, no.
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you can see,
the captain has turned on
the fasten seat belt?sign.
It appears we've run into
a rough patch of weather...
I have an announcement, too.
There is a Colonial woman
on the wing.
There's a woman on the wing.
I saw her.
There 's something
they're not telling us!
Steve.
All right.
There's a Colonial woman.
She was churning
butter on that wing.
Steve, get her.
She is out there right now.
Shit!
Everyone, remain calm!
I'm an Air Marshal.
Yes! I knew it.
I got your back, Jon!
There is a woman on the wing.
I saw her.
There's something


                                Page 63/101

they're not telling us.
Let's get out!
Let's open the doors
and get out!
She is dressed in
traditional Colonial garb.
Say goodbye!
We are going down!
Stay calm.
There is something
they are not telling us.
There is a Colonial
woman on the wing.
I will cover the pilot!
Who is she?
What does she want?
Just let me make it
up to you, please.
I'm telling you,
your shower is
going to be amazing.
I have so many ideas.
I want to talk to
you about the shower.
I feel like
it has been really
overwhelming for you.
It's just starting
to make you crazy.
No, Lil, I'm fine.
I mean...
Lil, I'm fine.
No, you're not fine.
You are not fine, Annie,
and we need things to just
flow smoothly from now on
and Helen just knows
how to do this kind of stuff.
She does it all the time.
She is good at it.
She likes doing it.
This way you don't have to
plan any more
lunches or trips.


                                Page 64/101

You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.
I get it.
I think it'll be
best here on out
for the shower
and for everything.
Yeah,
whatever you want.
I mean,
it's probably best.
I think so, right?
Yeah.
I just want you
to be happy.
I think that
will make me happy.
It will be good.
Okay.
Okay.
Good.
Hey.
Hey.
Do you want to hang out?
- It's not funny!
- Stop laughing.
it's a little funny.
None of those girls
are laughing, believe me.
It's not funny.
Have you ever been
kicked off a plane?
I can't say that I have.
Thank you.
All of the girls
hate me right now.
You are like
the maid of dishonor.
I hope Lillian isn't
going to be mad at me
for too long.
No, she will be all right.
I don't know,
I just wish things were


                                Page 65/101

the way that they
used to be, you know.
I feel like her
life is going off
and getting perfect,
and mine is just like...
It will turn around,
you know.
I have been hearing
that for a long time.
It's going to turn around.
I just know it.
Anyway.
You got to bake.
I don't really do
that any more, I told you.
Why?
I don't know,
it's just...
I don't know,
after it just went under,
I just, kind of,
stopped, I guess.
It doesn't make
me happy any more.
Just because you didn't
make any money at it,
doesn't mean that
you failed at it.
I lost a lot of money.
All my money.
But you are so good at it.
Oh, well.
Let's change the subject.
No more baking.
I'm done.
I don't know how
you just can't do it any more.
If I wasn't a cop any more,
I would still...
Arrest people?
...Go out with
a gun and shoot people.
I probably wouldn't do that.


                                 Page 66/101

I'm just trying to
make you feel better.
You are okay, you know.
You don't
know me very well.
I know you well enough
to know that
you're not so bad.
You got some stuff.
Oh, yeah.
You got bits and
pieces going on.
Thanks.
I have been thinking
about you a little bit.
About me? Really?
There is something
about you.
Something about
you that sticks.
- I hate buttons.
Where is the bedroom?
Sorry. It's a mountain bike.
Are you okay?
Do you like mountain biking?
Uh-huh.
Take this off.
I'm so glad
this is happening.
So am I.
Hello.
Morning.
Sorry, I didn't
mean to freak you out.
No, it's okay.
I haven't been
sitting here that long.
Oh.
Sorry, I guess I fell asleep.
I didn't mean to sleep over.
Don't be silly.
I made you a cappuccino.
Made it?
Yeah.


                                Page 67/101

So, last night was fun.
It was.
It was very fun.
I had fun.
It was fun.
If you care to
accompany me to the kitchen,
the fun may continue.
A different kind of fun.
But why don't you
just get dressed
and whatever, and...
I left your
clothes over there.
Okay.
And I'll see you in there.
Okay.
There she is.
Your workshop awaits.
I know it's a bit crazy,
but I popped out
and I got a few little
baking bits and pieces.
Butter, milk.
Because I thought
that it would be fun
for us to bake together today.
Obviously, you will
be doing the baking.
I will be doing the eating.
Because you are the expert.
Yeah, I don't...
I don't really wanna...
Sorry. You went to
all this trouble, but...
Come on, I know you haven't
done it in a while,
but it'll be great.
Don't be silly,
just get into it.
You are so good at it.
All right. I get it.
It was a bit of a curve ball.
Yeah, I think


                                 Page 68/101

I'm going to go.
I'm sorry.
I should just
probably go.
Annie,
I don't know what
you are getting
so upset about.
Because you don't know me.
You don't know anything
about me or my life or...
Well, no, because...
I don't know what
you're trying to do here.
I don't need you to fix me.
To fix you?
I don't need any help.
I mean, who do
you think you are?
Jesus, Annie,
we had a really good time.
And now you are being all...
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have
come here last night.
Last night was a mistake.
Fucking hell. All right.
Hey, it's Lillian.
Leave a message
after the beep.
Hey, Lil, it's me.
Umm...
I'm sure you're probably still
a little bit mad at me,
but I hope not.
Anyway, the excitement
still continues with me.
I just slept with
a cop that pulled me over
and I woke up today,
and he was really
sweet and nice and cute.
So, naturally,
I ran out


                                 Page 69/101

as fast as I could.
What's wrong with me?
Umm...
Anyway, I know you
are busy and stuff,
so just call me
when you get a chance.
I'd love to talk
this out with you
when you can.
Okay, bye.
Annie! Annie, wake up.

It's 11:
Oh, shit.
You got a package.
I'd bring it to you,
but you said,
""Don't touch my things.""
Please join us for
a Parisian brunch
at the home of
Helen Harris III
to celebrate the marriage
of Lillian Donovan
and Douglas Price.
Let us shower Lillian
with gifts and love.
Rpondez s'il vous plait. Yay!
Excuse me.
Oh. Hi.
I'm looking for a birthday
gift for my best friend.
Oh.
I want to get her
a necklace that says,
""Best Friends Forever.""
You sure you want
it to say ""Forever""?
Yeah, why?
Come on. ""Forever""?
Forever.
I don't think you guys
will be best friends forever.


                                Page 70/101

No offense.
But you know...
The friends you have
when you are
younger sometimes...
Sometimes you grow apart
when you get older.
Maybe she'll find
a new best friend.
And maybe she
will be more
successful than you are
and prettier and
richer and skinnier
and they end up doing
everything together.
You are weird.
I'm not weird. Okay?
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not,
and you started it.
No, you started it.
Did you forget
to take your Xanax
this morning?
God, I feel bad
for your parents.
I feel bad for your face.
Okay, well,
call me when
your boobs come in.
You call me
when yours come in.
What, do you have
four boyfriends?
Exactly.
Yeah, okay, have fun
having a baby at your prom.
You look like an old mop.
You know what?
You're not as popular
as you think you are.
I am very popular.
I'm sure you are.


                              Page 71/101

Very popular.
Well, you're an old,
single loser
who is never going
to have any friends.
You're a little cunt.
I'm sorry.
Let me tell my mom, okay.
I already told her.
Was she mad?
Hi, Annie,
it's Rhodes again.
Since you're not
returning any of my calls,
I assume that
you're not interested
in spending any
more time with me,
which is fine.
So don't worry,
I won't be bothering
you ever again.
Get those taillights fixed.
We'd like to invite you
to no longer live
with us any more.
What? What do you mean?
I don't get it.
The thing is,
we decided that it was
actually a bit immature
for a grown-up
brother and sister to
still be living
together with a roommate.
At our age, it's a bit
ridiculous, isn't it?
Yeah.
We look a bit silly,
don't we?
Pathetic.
So we are actually
going to live together alone.
Without you.


                                Page 72/101

You're moving out.
She's not moving.
She will move.
Eventually.
Eventually.
She has to.
She is taking it in.
You have to leave.
Oh! That's prickly.
Hi.
Hi.
Remember when you
thought I hit bottom?
That wasn't bottom.
Come here.
We're gonna have fun.
I, for one,
am really glad you're here.
And guess what?
Good timing.
You know what
just came in today
on the Netflix?
Cast Away. Tom Hanks.
It's like Forrest Gump,
but on an island.
Honey, you are gonna love it.
My God.
This is her driveway?
Who is that man?
Are you a guest of
Helen Harris III?
Yes. Technically. I guess.
An attendant will
meet you at the stables.
Where?
The shower is over
the second bridge.
Pink lemonade?
Thank you.
I don't have a cup holder.
Can I just give that...
Pink lemonade.
Nice. Nice touch.


                                Page 73/101

Shit.
God damn it, that's good.
Mmm.
Shit, that is fresh.
This is the most
beautiful shower
I have ever been to.
Yes, and Helen
is giving out the
cutest party favors.
I know,
I love their pink berets.
Would you like
some champagne?
Yes.
It's French.
Annie. Hey.
Hi.
How are you doing?
You're here.
Yeah, I'm here.
I was invited. Sorry.
Of course you were invited.
I just meant you have arrived.
No, I was just joking.
Okay.
Can you believe this?
Isn't it amazing?
Yep.
Yeah. it's nice.
Yeah. Pretty.
Are we okay?
Yes, I'm sorry
I haven't called.
I just didn't want
to bug you, but...
Forgive me.
It just got crazy.
There has been lots
of organizing, and...
I have so much to tell you.
I have to say hi to my aunt
or she will get mad at my mom.
No, you gotta go do


                                 Page 74/101

your party rounds.
Yeah.
I'll see you in a minute.
Yeah. Okay.
Oh! Rita,
you got all our towels.
Yes, I did.
Because I love you, Kitten.
All right,
let's see what's next.
Another one,
another one, another one.
I know who this is from.
I can tell by the wrapping.
Is that you?
Annie, you made this.
Look.
- Oh, man.
- Oh, my gosh.
It's us, Annie.
- Oh, my God.
- Let me see.
Oh, my God.
This is all my
favorite stuff from all the
stores I love in Milwaukee.
Annie!
This is so unbelievable.
Wilson Phillips.
Man, I love Wilson Phillips.
We listened to Hold On
probably 10,000 times
when I got my
driver's license.
This is such an amazing gift.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I feel really bad, Lil,
I didn't get a chance
to actually get you a present
because I have been so busy
organizing the shower.
Helen, please.
It's more than enough.


                                Page 75/101

Here is a card to
say congratulations.
Thank you.
Gosh, you have
really outdone yourself.
Oh, my God, Helen.
Honey, what is it?
Helen's taking me
to Paris.
Your face!
I got you. I fooled you.
Look at your face.
It's just a little
pre-wedding vacation.
And while we're there,
we're gonna meet
the designer of her dress
and have a fitting.
You are
taking me to Paris?
Oh, my God! This is
the best present ever!
Thank you so much.
A Paris!
Oh, my God.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Annie!
No, Mom.
Motherfucking Paris?
Annie,
what are you doing?
I told you about Paris, Helen.
I told you about
this whole idea!
- Annie, calm down.
- No, Lillian!
What, you're gonna
go to Paris with Helen now?
What, you guys are
gonna ride around
on bikes
with berets and
fucking baguettes
in the basket of


                                 Page 76/101

the front of your bikes?
How romantic!
What woman
gives another woman
a trip to Paris?
Am I right? Lesbian.
We're all thinking it,
aren't we?
I'm not.
Okay? Yes, we're all
thinking it, right?
I was.
Annie...
Lillian, this is not
the ""you"" that I know.
The ""you"" that I
know would have
walked in here
and rolled your eyes
and thought
this was completely
over-the-top,
ridiculous and stupid.
Look at this shower!
Look at that fucking cookie!
Did you really think
that this group of women
was going to
finish that cookie?
Really? You know what?
That reminds me, actually.
I never got a chance
to try that fucking cookie!
Stupid fucking cookie!
Delicious! Stupid cookie.
I think I'll...
Maybe it's better if I
dip it in the chocolate.
is this what
you want, Lillian?
This is so awesome.
All right,
let's have some nice,
hot, unsanitary chocolate!


                               Page 77/101

Ahh! It's hot!
Jesus! God!
Christ, Annie.
Have you lost
your fucking mind?
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
You wouldn't know,
would you?
Where have you been?
You would have no idea.
Let me fill you in, okay?
Ever since you got engaged,
everything has turned to shit!
You know what?
This is supposed
to be about my time!
You have managed
to ruin every event
in my wedding.
Thank you very much.
Okay, well,
thank you very much.
It's all her fault.
It is not mine!
And you would know that,
if you got your
beautiful haired head
out of your asshole.
In fact, out of her asshole,
which I'm sure is
perfectly bleached.
You know what? It is!
And you know how I know?
Because I went to
the fucking salon with her
and I got my
asshole bleached, too!
And I love my new asshole!
You know what?
Why can't you
just be happy for me
and then go home and
talk behind my back later,


                                 Page 78/101

like a normal person?
I am happy for you, Lillian.
I am very happy for you.
I wish you well.
I won't bother
you any more.
Are you kidding me? Annie!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Get back here! Stop.
No, no! She does
not get a party favor.
She does not get a dog!
And if you are
going to act like this,
then don't even bother
coming to my wedding!
I'm proud of you, Lil.
Shut up, Helen!
Anybody else have anything
they want to share today?
I took two dogs already.
They're in the back of my van.
What?
What? Where are you going?
Hit and run! Classy!
Perfect! Okay.
I'm gonna find you!
I'm coming!
Come on! Come on! Come on.
No!
Shit.
I can't say
I'm surprised.
I did tell you to
get your lights fixed.
Yeah, I know.
And now here we are.
Look, I have
had a horrible day.
I don't need a lecture
from you right now, okay?
I just... Helen just...
Oh! Don't...
This didn't happen


                                 Page 79/101

because of Helen.
This happened
because you didn't get
your taillights fixed.
It's pretty simple.
Do you have any idea
how frustrating it is
to see you,
night by night,
drive past me
with your fucking
taillights still broken?
Do you have any idea
how crazy that makes me?
It's a simple solution!
Your problem, Annie,
is that you just
don't understand
that you can hurt people
with these broken lights.
Don't you see how
irresponsible this is?
Yes, I should have
gotten my fucking
taillights fixed.
But I didn't, okay?
I didn't.
Listen,
don't worry about it.
Seriously.
Your message
was received.
No, look, please,
I don't know what's
going on with me right now.
Look, it's fine. Don't bother.
Really, what's done is done.
That's it?
Where are you going?
That's it! That's it.
That's how this works.
Come on. I didn't...
For the record, Annie,
you flirted with me.


                                 Page 80/101

You made me feel like
you really liked me,
which was really unfair.
And then you came home with me
and we did stuff, fun stuff,
and then you just left,
just like it was nothing.
Oh, please. I know
how guys do this thing.
I know how guys act.
One minute,
it means something.
The next minute, it doesn't.
Right, yeah, you've
got it all figured out.
Yeah.
How is that
working out for you?
Pretty good?
Boom!
What's up, fuck-buddy?
You call for some
roadside assistance?
Thanks, officer.
I can handle it
from here on out.
Come on!
I didn't have
anyone else to call!
I didn't know that
you were gonna show up!
That's the problem
with cops, Annie.
We're just never
there when you need us.
That cop talks weird.
- Come on, dingus.
Tick-tock. I got shit to do.
Check it out.
Look what's steering the car.
Thanks again
for picking me up.
Not a problem.
Were you busy?


                                 Page 81/101

Well, it is Friday.
You know,
you look tired.
If you're tired,
you can totally
lay down in my lap,
if you want.
What?
Just take a little lap-nap.
If you want.
Open for biz.
Okay, can you just pull over?
Yeah, actually,
that's an even better idea.
No, no, no, can you
please just stop the car?
I want to get out.
No, it's super gravelly.
Please pull over!
Why?
Because I would rather
get murdered out here
than spend the next
half-an-hour with you.
Can you please
just pull over?
Come on, Annie.
It's called humor.
Learn about it.
Besides, I would
never last a half-hour.
Good bye, Ted.
If you're trying to
turn me on, it's working.
You used me!
No big deal.
You are no longer
my number three!
Wilson!
Wilson! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, Wilson.
Wilson, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Oh, no, Wilson.


                                Page 82/101

Wilson!
I'm coming in.
Let's go, let's go.
And we're walking.
Okay, we're walking.
Heel. Heel!
No pee. No!
Not on the carpet!
Okay, we're coming...
We're coming in.
Everybody is in
and having fun.
We're having fun.
And heel! We're heeling.
Heel!
How many of
those did you take?
I took nine.
Yeah, I did
slightly over-commit
to the whole dog thing.
It turns out, I'm probably
more comfortable with six.
It's a lot... That's
a lot of energy to deal with.
But you wouldn't know
anything about that,
because you haven't
been returning my calls.
And say what, Megan?
Say, ""Hi, I can't
get off the couch.
""I got fired from my job.
I got kicked out
of my apartment.
""I can't pay any of my bills.
My car is a piece of shit.
""I don't have any friends.
The last time
You know what I
find interesting
about that, Annie?
It's interesting to me
that you have


                                Page 83/101

absolutely no friends.
You know why
it's interesting?
Here's a friend
standing directly
in front of you,
trying to talk to you.
And you choose to
talk about the fact
that you don't
have any friends.
You know what I mean.
No, I don't think
you want any help.
I think you want to
have a little pity party.
That's not true.
I think Annie wants
a little pity party.
You're an asshole, Annie!
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
You're an asshole. I'm life.
Is life bothering you?
Yes! What are you doing?
I'm life, Annie.
I'm life, Annie.
You have got to
fight back on life.
Megan!
You better learn to fight.
Megan!
I'm life and I'm going
to bite you in the ass!
Megan...
it's not me.
I'm your life. Turn over!
My God!
I'm trying to get you to fight
for your shitty life,
and you won't do it!
You just won't do it.
Stop it.
You stop slapping yourself.


                                 Page 84/101

Stop slapping yourself.
I'm your life, Annie.
I'm your shitty...
I'm sorry.
Nice hit.
All right.
I'm glad to see
you've got a little
bit of spark in you.
I knew that Annie
was in there somewhere.
I think...
I think you're ready now
to hear a little
story about a girl.
A girl named Megan.
A girl named
Megan that didn't have
a very good time
in high school.
I'm referring to
myself when I say ""Megan.""
It's me, Megan.
Yeah, I got that.
I know you look at
me now and think,
""Boy, she must have
breezed through high school.""
Not the case, Annie.
No, this was not easy
going up and down the halls.
Okay?
They used to
try to blow me up.
They threw
firecrackers at my head.
Firecrackers.
I mean literally.
I'm not saying
that figuratively.
I got firecrackers
thrown at my head.
They called me a freak.
Do you think I


                                Page 85/101

let that break me?
Do you think I went home
to my mommy, crying,
""I don't have any friends.
Megan doesn't
have any friends""?
No, I did not.
You know what I did?
I pulled myself up,
I studied really hard.
I read every book in
the library. And now?
I work for the government.
I have
the highest possible
security clearance.
Don't repeat that!
I won't.
I can't protect you.
I know where
all the nukes are
and I know the codes.
I won't say anything.
You would be amazed.
A lot of shopping malls.
Don't repeat that!
I won't.
I have six houses.
I bought an 18-wheeler
a couple of months
ago just because I could.
Okay, you lost Lillian.
You got another best friend
sitting right in front of you,
if you would notice.
Huh?
Now, you got to stop
feeling sorry for yourself.
Okay, 'cause I do not
associate with people
that blame the world
for their problems.
'Cause you're
your problem, Annie.


                                 Page 86/101

And you're also
your solution.
Right? I mean, that's...
You get that?
I just miss her, I guess.
Yeah, I know you do.
I know you do.
All right, come on.
Bring it in.
There's the Annie...
There's the Annie I
knew was there, okay?
All right.
Man, you have got
to wash your hair.
I'm sorry.
You've got to
wash that hair.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I love you.
Looks great. Thank you.
Rhodes and I worked out
a deal way back when,
so it's on the house.
Are you serious?
Yeah. I owe him big time.
That's really nice.
Hey, Mom?
This is my mom, Judy.
Hey, how are you?
Nice to meet you.
Good to meet you, too.
Wait a minute,
don't I know you from AA?
Oh, my gosh.
You made that artichoke dip,
didn't you?
It's good, huh?
It's just delicious.
Come in.
Are you sure
you're not gonna
come with me today?


                               Page 87/101

It's Lillian's big day.
Mom, she doesn't
want me there.
I'll fix you
a tuna fish sandwich.

Mom, it's 8:
in the morning.
You can put syrup on it.
I know.
Hi.
What do you want?
I was wondering
if you knew
where Lillian was.
No, why would I...
What do you mean?
I can't find her.
We've looked everywhere.
What?
She is missing.
Can you help?
Okay, just wait here.
I think I know
someone that
might be able to help.
I'll get my Keys.
Can I just use...
I mean, I just don't know
what could have
possibly gone wrong.
Everything was going smoothly.
The dress looked fantastic.
It had come in from Paris.
Dougie was being
great and very helpful.
I had organized everything
to the last final detail.
I just...
I don't know
what's happened to her.
I don't know.
You should know, right?
You're her best friend.


                                 Page 88/101

It's weird that
you don't know.
You guys are so close.
Annie, I want to
apologize to you personally
for all of the things
that have gone down.
I know that I hurt you,
and that I created a distance
between you and Lillian.
I want to
apologize for that...
I don't want to hear...
...and everything
that happened
at the shower.
And with Las Vegas...
Okay, I don't want
to hear any more,
honestly.
I don't even
want to talk to you.
Harry never really
wants to talk to me, either.
He travels a lot.
Like, all year.
I'm basically just by myself.
I don't want to...
I don't feel sorry for you.
I really liked
that original dress
you picked at
the bridal store.
I thought it was beautiful.
You have really lovely taste.
Thanks, but it's
a little too late for that.
And I know...
I don't think
that Brazilian food
really gave us food poisoning.
NO, it did.
No, I don't think it did.
It was the food.


                                 Page 89/101

I shit my pants
on the way home.
I don't think it
was your fault.
That was my fault.
I think people just
ask me to their weddings
because I'm good at
organizing parties.
I don't have any
female friends.
I'm so sorry.
Why are you smiling, Annie?
It's just...
It's just...
It's the first time I've
ever seen you look ugly.
And that makes
me kind of happy.
I look ugly? No, I don't.
I don't really look ugly.
A little bit.
You're an ugly crier,
but that's okay.
No, I'm not really
an ugly crier.
Maybe just
a little bit.
No.
Just a little bit.
It's just my makeup.
But I still look pretty good.
Rhodes!
Rhodes.
Rhodes.
Come on! Rhodes!
He's ignoring you.
Let me.
Yes, he is.
- Officer!
- Roll down your window!
Excuse me! Please!
Rhodes,
I know you can hear me,


                                Page 90/101

and I know you're mad at me,
but I need your help. Please!
You know this guy?
What are you doing?
I just want to
get his attention.
Annie! Oh, my God.
Reckless driving!
Annie, my hair!
What are you doing?
I'm speeding!
You better pull me over!
Really?
Here comes
the litter-bug!
Let's see what
Marmaduke's doing.
Just texting.
Talking on the phone
while I'm driving.
Not even using my hands.
Oh, hi!
Mmm! Yum! Yum!
Beer!
Yum! Yum! Yum!
Idiot.
Hey, what's up, man?
I don't care. I don't care.
I'm going to hurl.
I feel really sick, Annie!
Hey, who's driving that car?
Can we go up now?
That's not clever.
Hey!
I'm topless!
I'm totally topless.
Really?
Wow. Unbelievable.
What the fuck are you doing?
I don't know.
Hey! Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
All of that stuff,
that would have been


                                Page 91/101

dangerous for a good driver.
I'm sorry. I just...
I really need your help.
We can't find Lillian.
How long has she been gone?
She's been
missing for 12 hours.
It's not a missing person
until it's at least 24 hours.
Have you ever seen CSI?
Let me get on
with my job, Annie.
Nathan, please?
I really need your help.
Please, Nathan.
Who is this one?
This is Helen.
I'm Helen.
What?
It's Helen.
Hello, Helen.
I've heard wonderful things.
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Bye-bye.
Okay, we've traced
her cell phone
to the corner of
Craner and Rose.
Do you know where that is?
Yes. That is her apartment.
I thought you said
you looked there.
We did. We did.
Last night.
Okay.
So you're saying
she's at her apartment?
That's what you're telling me?
She must have gone
back after you left.
God, that was crazy of her.
Thank God! Thank you.
Let's go. Let's go.
Okay.


                                 Page 92/101

We found her!
I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to
waste your time.
That's embarrassing.
Thank you.
No, you are welcome.
It's this kind of
high-octane stuff
that really made me
want to become a cop.
""Missing girl found
at her apartment.""
It's...
It's adrenalin-pinching.
It's nice to see you.
I'm glad that you got
your taillights fixed.
Means I won't have
to stop you again.
Okay.
Annie, let's go.
Anyway,
go and save your friend
from her apartment.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Do you mind actually
if I go by myself?
Sure.
Okay.
Lil?
Lillian?
Lil?
Go away.
What happened?
This whole
wedding is fucked up.
Helen just took
over everything, and
everything's got
out of control.
And my dad can't
afford the wedding.


                           Page 93/101

This has been really
hard to do without you.
It's been shitty.
I'm sorry.
Nope. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I kicked
you out of my wedding.
It's my fault.
No, it's my fault.
I think I'm the one
with the mental problems.
Yeah, wasn't it my
turn to be crazy?
The bride's
supposed to be crazy.
Yes, technically.
You kind of
stole all the crazy.
I out-crazied you.
Everything's
going to be okay.
Yeah? How do you know that?
I left the rehearsal
dinner last night.
I told Dougie I
had to go get Q-tips.
And
all of a sudden,
I realized I was
driving here.
I came here.
I realized this
is the last time
I'm going to be here
in this apartment
with that couch,
and this bed,
and take a bath in my bathtub.
Because you know
how much I love my bathtub.
It's a good tub.
I slept in there on my
Uh-huh.
Everything's gonna change.


                                 Page 94/101

I mean, I'm not
going to get to
live five
minutes away from you.
And it makes me so sad.
Well, don't be.
Don't be sad.
Because things
are going to change,
but they'll be better.
You know?
You're gonna take
this huge, great,
beautiful step.
And Dougie loves you
more than anything.
And so do I.
But what about you?
What's gonna happen to you?
I'm gonna be fine.
So don't worry, okay?
I'm gonna be...
I'm gonna be fine.
I am fine.
And besides, you need
to blaze the trail for me.
And then report back
and tell me what's coming.
Whatever you say, boss.
All right, let's get
your dress on,
okay, and let's go
to your wedding.
Oh, yeah.
That's the other problem.
Don't you dare laugh.
Okay.
I cannot wear this dress!
Okay, don't panic.
This is a nightmare.
We'll fix it.
We'll tweak it.
I will not let you
walk down that aisle


                              Page 95/101

unless you look
perfect and beautiful,
I promise.
Do you have a chainsaw
and a blowtorch?
I think this wedding
is gonna be a disaster.
No, don't say that.
If Helen had anything
to do with this wedding,
it is going to be perfect
and tasteful and beautiful.
That's true.
Will you, Douglas,
take Lillian to be your wife?
Will you love her,
comfort her, and keep her
and, forsaking all others,
remain true to her
as long as you
both shall live?
I do.
And will you,
Lillian, take Douglas
to be your husband?
Will you love him,
comfort him, and keep him
as long as you
both shall live?
I do.
By the powers
vested in me
by the state of Illinois,
I pronounce you
husband and wife.
You may now kiss the bride.
Ladies and gentlemen,
here with us tonight is
Lillian's favorite band
singing her favorite song.
Put your hands
together for
Wilson Phillips!
Hi, everybody!


                                Page 96/101

How we doing tonight?
I am not paying
for this shit.
Really?
It's the last one,
I promise.
The last one.
The last one.
I know this pain
Why do you lock yourself
up in these chains?
No one can change
your life except for you
Don't ever let
anyone step all over you
Just open your
heart and your mind
ls it really fair to feel
This way inside
Someday
somebody's gonna make you
want to turn
around and say goodbye
Until then, baby,
are you going to let them
hold you down
and make you cry?
Don't you know
Don't you know
things can change
Things'll go your way
if you hold on
for one more day
Can you hold on
for one more day?
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day
You could sustain
Or are you
comfortable with the pain?
You've got no one
to blame for your unhappiness
No, baby
You got yourself


                                Page 97/101

into your own mess
Letting your
worries pass you by
Baby
Don't you think
it's worth your time
to change your mind?
No, no
Someday
somebody's gonna make you
want to turn
around and say goodbye
Until then, baby,
are you going to let them
hold you down
and make you cry?
What's so funny?
I put a loaded gun
in Dougie's carry-on.
The TSA is going to
just rip his ass apart.
Annie?
Oh. Hey.
Did you have
a nice evening?
It was beautiful. Yeah.
What did you
think of the wedding?
It was...
It was great.
It was great, right?
Yeah.
It was perfect.
It was great.
Yeah, it was great.
It was really
nice meeting you.
Yeah, it was...
Helen, it was really
nice meeting you, too.
Hey, you know, maybe
sometime the three of us
could go to
Rockin' Sushi together.


                            Page 98/101

Thank you, Annie.
I would love that.
Your ride is here.
Hey, how did everything go?
Strangely well.
Good.
So, I ate your cake
that you left.
You did?
Yeah.
I mean, I had to
fight some raccoons off.
But that's okay.
I'm pretty strong and tough,
so it wasn't
much of a contest.
So that might have been...
I'm just going to
kiss you now
rather than just...
Officer Rhodes,
please report to...
Oh! I'm on duty.
And I need to
put my uniform on.
If I drive like this,
they're gonna think
I just stole a car,
which wouldn't be great.
You could ride
with me if you want.
You want to come?
Yeah, I do.
Come on.
All right.
Whoa! Whoa!
Where are you going?
I'm getting in the car.
No, no, no, you got
to get in the back.
What?
You can't sit in the front,
it's against regulations.
Come on. Come on.


                               Page 99/101

You're going to make
me sit in the back seat?
Yeah, come on.
Sorry. Habit.
All right.
It's a force of habit.
Can I please get
in the front seat?
Actually, no, I'm afraid
there's a warrant
out for your arrest.
What? why?
Reckless driving,
littering, texting,
consuming alcohol
while operating a vehicle.
You didn't
think I was going to
let you get away
with that, did you?
Could we put the siren on?
Please?
Thank you.
I know that there is pain
But you hold
on for one more day
And you break
free from the chains
Yeah,
I know that there is pain
But you hold
on for one more day
And you break free,
break from the chains
Someday
somebody's gonna make you
want to turn
around and say goodbye
Until then, baby,
are you going to let them
hold you down
and make you cry?
Don't you know
Don't you know


                             Page 100/101

things can change
Things'll go your way
if you hold on
Okay. Umm...
This is Tape 119.
Air Marshall Jon and I's
first sexual encounter.
Is there
a hungry bear anywhere?
I'm a hungry bear.
I just happen to
have this bear sandwich.
Is there a hungry bear?
I'm a very
hungry bear.
Did you see how
my flap opens?
Yeah, that's
a good-looking
bear sandwich.
Yeah, that's a
big bear sandwich.
Do you want a bite
of that sandwich?
Feed me.
It's meat and cheeses.
Uh-Oh.
I hope you don't have
a salad. Oh, yeah.
Hey, guess what.
Guess what, ham.
Fuck it up.
I'm gonna fuck you up,
ham nipple.
Ham nipple.
Fuck it up.
A little hard.
OW!
A little hard.
A little hard.

# Friday night and everyone's moving?
# I can feel the heat?

# Heading down?
# I search for the beat
in this dirty town?
# Downtown, the young ones are going?
# Downtown, the young ones are growing?
# We're the kids in America?

nowhere! Here's where Dionne lives. She's my friend because we both know
what it's like to have people be jealous of us. Girlfriend! I must give her

come to America. But some people are all, What about the strain on our
resources? Then its like, when I had this garden party for my father's
birthday, right? I said RSVP because it was a sit-down dinner. But people
came that, like, did not RSVP, so I was, like, totally buggin'. I had to
haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food, squish in extra place
settings. But by the end of the day, it was, like, the more the merrier.
And so if the government could just get to the kitchen, rearrange some
things, we could certainly party with the Haiti-ans. And in conclusion may
I please remind you that it does not say RSVP on the Statue of Liberty?

Class:

Cher:

Mr Hall:

Amber:
she's talking about some little party.

Cher:

Mr. Hall:

Mr Hall:

Mr. Hall:

Travis:
way my kids are going to feel about Nine Inch Nails, so I really shouldn't
torment my mom anymore, huh?

Mr. Hall:
tolerance is always a good lesson. Even when it comes out of nowhere. And
with that in mind, I'm going to distribute your report cards. Now, is there
a Christian Stovitz in this class?

Cher:
custody. So he'll be spending one semester in Chicago and one semester
here. I think it is a travesty on the part of the legal profession.

pretend she still watches over me. Hey, Ma. 98 in Geometry. Pretty groovy,
huh? Yuck! Ugh. The maudlin music of the university station? Wah wah wah!
Yuck! What is it about college and crybaby music?

just a jumping-off point to start negotiations.

Mel:

your teachers will change your grades?

Cher:
my P.E. teacher an evil male had broken my heart. So she raised my C to a
B.

Ms. Stoeger:
this.

Cher:
to my congressman about violations of the Clean Air Act. But Mr. Hall was


                                 Page 8/62

totally rigid. He said my debates were unresearched, unstructured, and
unconvincing. As if! I felt impotent and out of control, which I really
hate. I needed to find sanctuary in a place where I could gather my
thoughts and regain my strength.

Dionne:
or something?

Cher:
all day, and I still don't know what to do about Mr. Hall. I've tried
everything to convince him of my scholastic aptitude, but I was brutally
rebuffed.

Dionne:
make everyone else miserable, too.

Cher:
sublimely happy. Here's the 411 on Mr. Hall... He's single, he's 47, and he
earns minor ducats at a thankless job. What that man needs is a good,
healthy boink fest. Unfortunately, there was a major babe drought in my
school. The evil trolls from the math department were actually married.
Ooh, Snickers. And in the grand tradition of P.E. teachers, Ms. Stoeger
seemed to be same-sex oriented. Of course, there was always Miss Geist.
Something told me not to discount Miss Geist. Well, sure, she has runs in
her stockings. and her slip is always showing, and she has more lipstick on
her teeth than on her mouth.

Mrs. Geist:

Cher:

Dionne:

Dionne:

Cher:

Mr. Hall:

Paradoasm:

Mr. Hall:
Birkenstock... 38 tardies. By far the most tardies in the class.
Congratulations.

Travis:
Uh, but I would like to say this. Tardiness is not something you can do all
on your own. Many, many people contributed to my tardiness. Uh, I would
like to thank my parents for never giving me a ride to school, the L.A.
city bus driver for taking a chance on an unknown kid, and uh, last but not
least, the wonderful crew at McDonald's for spending hours making those Egg
McMuffins, without which I might never be tardy.

Mr. Hall:
include in his speech. I'll go on. Cher Horowitz... two tardies.

Cher:

Mr. Hall:

Cher:
the ladies.

Mr. Hall:
I'll let that one slide.

Cher:

Mr. Hall:
one in this school with any intelligence.

Mel:
tickets without a license!

Cher:

Mel:
on, you will not drive, sit, do anything in that Jeep without a supervised
driver present and no cruising around with Dionne alright. Two permits do
not equal a license. Do I make myself clear?

Cher:

Mel:
apply yourself

Cher:

Mel:

Josh:

Cher:

Josh:
but in the interest of saving time, why don't you just tell me what you
want.

Cher:
but Daddy says I can't take the Jeep out without a licensed driver. Since
you're not doing anything and all you know...

is...

Cher:
my license, I fully intend to brake for animals, and I have contributed
many hours to helping two lonely teachers find romance.

Josh:

this Josh and Tai thing was wiggin' me more than anything. What was my
problem? Tai is my pal. I don't begrudge her a boyfriend. I really... Ooh!
I wonder if they have that in my size. What does she want with Josh anyway?
He dresses funny. He listens to complaint rock. He's not even cute...in a
conventional way. I mean, he's just like this slug who hangs around the
house all the time. And he's a hideous dancer. Couldn't take him anywhere.
Wait a second. What am I stressing about? This is, like, Josh.
# All by myself?

Cher:
Tai? She couldn't make him happy. Josh needs someone with imagination,
someone to take care of him, someone to laugh at his jokes...in case he
ever makes any. Then suddenly... Oh, my God. I love Josh. I am majorly,
totally, crazy in love with Josh. But now I don't know how to act around
him. I mean, ordinarily, I'd strut around him in my cutest little outfits
and send myself flowers and candy, but I couldn't do that stuff with Josh.

THUNDER)

SUPERIMPOSE:              LONDON
                           1995


INT. CALTHORPE HOTEL - CLOSE ON A PORTRAIT - NIGHT

of a modern ENGLISH LORD. The brass placard reads:
“Lord Rupert Calthorpe-Cavendish-Gore.”

REVEAL we’re in the lobby of an ostentatious hotel. It’s
deserted except for TWO CLERKS at the front desk. It is
the middle of the night and RAINING HEAVILY outside.


ANGLE ON HOTEL ENTRANCE

The revolving doors start to swing as TWO CHILDREN (NICK
8, ASTRID 8) and TWO CHINESE WOMEN, ELEANOR and FELICITY
YOUNG (30s) enter. They’re DRIPPING WET, dragging their
soaked luggage behind them.
Nick SLIDES his feet around the polished floor, leaving a
MUDDY CIRCLE in his wake. The clerks look horrified.
Eleanor makes her way to the front desk, while
complaining to Felicity about having to walk in the bad
weather.

                          ELEANOR
                 (in Cantonese;
                  subtitled)
            If you didn’t make us walk, we
            wouldn’t be soaked.

Felicity grabs the children by the hand and follows
Eleanor to the front desk.

                          CLERK #1
            May I help you? This is the
            Calthorpe, a private hotel --

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                        2.
CONTINUED:

Eleanor goes to the desk and replies in PERFECT ENGLISH --
her pronunciation is BRITISH, with a lilt unique to upper-
crust Chinese from former British colonies.

(NOTE: The specific accents of our players are important
character details, indications of their background,
education, and socioeconomic status.)

                        ELEANOR
          I’m Mrs. Eleanor Young. I have a
          reservation. The Lancaster suite.
               (sees his name tag)
          We spoke on the phone when I
          confirmed yesterday.

                        CLERK #1
          Sorry, don’t seem to have your
          reservation.

Clerk #2 surreptitiously presses a BUTTON under the
counter. Eleanor and Felicity exchange glances.
Felicity rolls her eyes, sensing what’s going on.

REGINALD ORMSBY (50s, pompous) pops out of a door behind
the front desk and the clerks move aside.

                        ORMSBY
          Good evening. I’m Reginald
          Ormsby, hotel manager. Is there a
          problem?

                        ELEANOR
          I’m Mrs. Eleanor Young. My family
          and I would like to be shown to
          our suite. We’ve had a long
          flight.
Ormsby takes in Eleanor et al, makes a snap judgment.

                        ORMSBY
          We’re fully booked, madam. You
          must have made a mistake. I’m
          sure you and your lovely family
          can find other accommodations.
          May I suggest you explore
          Chinatown?

                         FELICITY
                (in Cantonese;
                 subtitled; mutters)
          You can explore Hell. You dog
          turd.



                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                        3.
CONTINUED:

                        ELEANOR
          Please, may I use your phone to
          call my husband? It’s the least
          you can do.

Eleanor levels a glare at Ormsby, who looks at her with a
tight smile.


EXT. CALTHORPE HOTEL (LONDON) - NIGHT

RAIN POURS on the children and Felicity as they watch
Eleanor in a PHONE BOOTH. “THE CALTHORPE” sign casts a
glow over them. We don’t know what she’s saying, but we
hear Eleanor angrily speaking on the pone.


INT. CALTHORPE HOTEL (LONDON) - NIGHT

Eleanor bursts through the front door with her family
right behind her. Eleanor approaches the front desk
again. Ormsby is not pleased.

                        ORMSBY
          Mrs. Young! I must ask you to
          leave, or I’ll have to call the
          police.

                        ELEANOR
          Please, go right ahead.

Ormsby is taken aback. He moves to stop her when the
elevator DINGS and OPENS and an ELDERLY MAN IN A SILK
ROBE AND SLIPPERS comes out -- LORD CALTHORPE, the same
man in the opening portrait and owner of the hotel.
Ormsby snaps to.
                        ORMSBY
          Lord Calthorpe! My apologies for
          this disturbance --

Lord Calthorpe ignores Ormsby and beelines for Eleanor.

                        LORD CALTHORPE
          Eleanor! I just got off the phone
          with your husband.

Lord Calthorpe kisses Eleanor on the cheek, and snaps at
the clerks.

                        LORD CALTHORPE
          Get the Lancaster suite ready.
          Now.

Ormsby reacts, confused.
                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                        4.
CONTINUED:

                         ORMSBY
           Surely you’re joking, sir.

                         LORD CALTHORPE
           I assure you, I’m not. As of this
           evening, my family’s long history
           as custodians of the Calthorpe is
           ended. I am selling the hotel to
           my dear friends, the Young family
           of Singapore.

Ormsby looks at Eleanor, shocked.

                          LORD CALTHORPE
           Meet the new lady of the house,
           Eleanor Young.
                (to Eleanor)
           Join me for a toast.

                         ELEANOR
           We’d be delighted.
                (turns to address
                 Ormsby)
           Do get a mop. The floor’s wet.

Eleanor winks at Nick, who grins and looks back at
Ormsby.

                         ORMSBY
                (to Clerk #1)
           Get a mop.

INT. DARK ROOM - PRESENT DAY (2017)

Staring across a table is RACHEL CHU (29, Chinese-
American, beautiful, sharp). She exudes confidence.
PULL BACK to reveal a pile of chips in front of her.

We see someone else’s hand checking the cards they’ve
been dealt: 2 KINGS, 2 NINES, and a JACK. They’re in
the middle of a five card draw poker game.


                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         5.
CONTINUED:

As the CAMERA TILTS UP we see CURTIS (late 20s, T.A.,
white) is the player sitting across from Rachel. He
stares at her over his black-rimmed glasses, trying to
read her. She stares back, revealing nothing.

Rachel pushes the pile of chips to the center of the
poker table.

                        RACHEL
          I’m all in.

Curtis has FIVE CHIPS left.    He checks his cards again,
then FOLDS.

                        CURTIS
          Fold.

Rachel flips over her cards.   She’s got nothing.

                        CURTIS
          Nothing!
               (as Rachel laughs)
          This whole time you had nothing.

The lights come up and we see A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE CLAP
AND TITTER. REVEAL we’re in: AN AUDITORIUM CLASSROOM
with UNDERGRAD STUDENTS. The poker table onstage is
being shown on two LARGE FLATSCREENS so the students can
follow the action.

Rachel takes the lectern.   “Game Theory 290” appears on
the side screens.

                        RACHEL
          All right, so, how did I beat T.A.
          Curtis so very, very badly? Well,
          I know for a fact that Curtis is
          cheap.

The students all smile and laugh, totally engaged.

                        RACHEL
          So, he’s not playing using logic
          or math, but using his psychology.
          Our brains so hate the idea of
          losing something that’s valuable
          to us, that we abandon all
          rational thought and make some
          really poor decisions. So Curtis
          wasn’t playing to win. He was
          playing not to lose.
               (to Curtis; tosses
                him a chip)
          Here. Put it towards a haircut.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                        6.
CONTINUED:

The class LAUGHS.   Curtis takes the $10 with a BANDAGED
HAND.

                        RACHEL
          All right, that’s it for today.
          Don’t forget your essays on
          conditional probability are due
          next week --

As students file out, NICK walks in and smiles
lasciviously.

INT. PHILLIP AND ELEANOR’S HOUSE (SINGAPORE) - MORNING

ELEANOR reads a Bible verse aloud to a group of ladies.

                        ELEANOR
          ‘If then you have been raised with
          Christ, seek the things that are
          above, where Christ is seated at
          the right hand of God.’

It’s been twenty years since we’ve seen Eleanor, but she
looks amazing. She sits with FOUR FABULOUSLY DRESSED,
BEJEWELED WOMEN: JACQUELINE LING (50s), ALIX YOUNG
(50s), NADINE (30s), AND LORENA (40s). Uniformed MAIDS
serve tea and “kuih,” local cakes.

                        ELEANOR
          ‘Set your minds on things that are
          above, not on things that are on
          Earth.’

Eleanor’s interrupted by BUZZING. She looks disapproving
as Alix and Jacqueline check their messages.

These matriarchs speak with UPPER-CRUST CHINESE
SINGAPOREAN ACCENTS (perfect grammar with local
flourishes). Jacqueline reacts, surprised.

                        JACQUELINE
          Eleanor, is Nicki bringing a girl
          to Colin’s wedding? My Amanda
          heard it from her friend,
          Francesca...

Eleanor is surprised, but tries not to let on.

                        ALIX
               (looking at phone)
          Eddie says her name is Rachel Chu?

                        NADINE
          Oh! I thought that Nick was
          coming alone. Did you know he had
          a girlfriend?

All eyes are on Eleanor who covers, not wanting to get
into the details.



                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                      11.
CONTINUED:

                         ELEANOR
          Nick dates many girls.   It’s hard
          to keep track.

                        JACQUELINE
          Amanda knows everyone and she has
          never heard of her.

                        NADINE
          Rachel Chu. Or maybe she’s from
          the Taiwan plastics Chu family?

                        ALIX
               (low; conspiratorial)
          If you want, I have a private
          investigator. Very discreet --

                        ELEANOR
               (interrupting)
          I think we should return to the
          word of God. Alix?

The women reluctantly return to their Bibles.

                        ALIX
          Ephesians. Chapter six, verse
          four. ‘Bring up your children in
          the discipline and instruction of
          the Lord.’
               (can’t help herself)
          Oh, I do hope she’s a good,
          Christian girl.

                        JACQUELINE
          Well, if he’s bringing her home,
          it must be serious.
                          NADINE
          Exactly.

The women all look at Eleanor.


INT. CAKE & CARRY - NIGHT

RESUME Rachel and Nick.   Nick’s phone rings.

                          NICK
          It’s my mum.    Do you mind?

                          RACHEL
          Mm, go ahead.

Rachel is about to dig into pudding #2.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                       12.

                        NICK
               (to Rachel)
          All right. Save me some of that.

                           RACHEL
          Okay.

Nick gets up to take the call away from the counter.

                        NICK
               (into phone)
          Hey, Mum, everything okay?

                        ELEANOR (V.O.)
          Does something have to wrong for
          me to call?

                           NICK
          Yeah, usually.

                         ELEANOR (V.O.)
          Ha, ha, ha.   Very funny.


INT. PHILLIP AND ELEANOR’S HOUSE (SINGAPORE) - DAY

Eleanor is on her phone standing away from her Bible
group. Keeps her voice low, casual.

INTERCUT AS NECESSARY with Nick and Eleanor talking on
the phone.

                        ELEANOR
          Are you bringing the girl you’re
          seeing to Colin’s wedding?
                         NICK
                (confused)
          Hmm. We were literally just
          talking about that. How could you
          know?

                        ELEANOR
          Everybody knows.

Nick sees Celine (the only other Asian in the restaurant)
leaving through a revolving door.

                        NICK
          Radio One Asia.

Eleanor notices the other women trying to eavesdrop.



                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                        13.
CONTINUED:

                        ELEANOR
               (to ladies)
          Move on to Corinthians, I’ll catch
          up.

                         ALIX
          Ah, yes.

                        ELEANOR
               (back to phone; low)
          We’re looking forward to having
          you home. And your room is all
          ready... for you.

Nick hears this, gets the implication.

                        NICK
          Thanks, Mom. But Rachel and I
          will be staying together.

Eleanor is disappointed, makes another attempt:

                        ELEANOR
          I see. Well, I’m having the house
          redone. And it’s not ready for
          guests. If Rachel comes, I think
          she might be more comfortable
          staying somewhere else?

Nick returns to the counter, to see the second sticky
toffee pudding is gone, except for a TINY PIECE.

                         NICK
          All right.   Sorry about that.

                        RACHEL
          I saved you a piece.

                        NICK
          You did, did you? A very small
          piece at that. Thank you very
          much.

                        RACHEL
          How’s your mom? Everything okay?

                         NICK
          Mm.   Couldn’t be better.

Rachel kisses nick.

                        RACHEL (V.O.)
               (pre-lap)
          Hey, Mom, this one’s kind of cute.

                                                        14.


INT. CLOTHING BOUTIQUE - DAY

Rachel looks at her reflection in a mirror as she holds a
blue and white dress to her body. Her mother, KERRY
(50s, real estate agent, Chico chic), shakes her head.
Kerry has a slight Chinese immigrant accent.

                        RACHEL
          What do you think?

                        KERRY
          No! No! No! No! You can’t wear
          that to meet Nick’s Ah Ma. Blue
          and white is for Chinese funerals.
          Now this, this symbolizes good
          fortune and fertility.

Kerry holds up a conservative RED dress.

                        RACHEL
          Great! I was really going for
          that ‘lucky baby-maker’ vibe.

                        KERRY
          Hey! You are the one who asked
          for my help picking out a dress to
          meet Nick’s family.

                        RACHEL
          It’s only ‘cause I hardly know
          anything about them. Every time I
          bring them up Nick changes the
          subject.

                        KERRY
          Maybe he’s embarrassed. Maybe his
          parents are poor, and he has to
          send them money. That’s what all
          good Chinese children do.

Rachel chuckles and they keep searching for the right
dress.

                        KERRY
          Oh, you are going to have a
          wonderful time. You’ve always
          wanted to go to Asia and who
          knows, if all goes well in
          Singapore, you might just come
          back with a souvenir.

                        RACHEL
          Mom, stop! Nick and I haven’t
          even talked about that.

          me, right?

Kerry has a sour look on her face and turns away to begin
rummaging through a clothes rack.

                        RACHEL

          What was that look?    I saw that.

                        KERRY
          Nothing. It’s just, Nick bringing
          a girl all the way there to meet
          them can mean a lot to these
          overseas families. Eh, they’re
          different from us.

                        RACHEL
          How are they different? They’re
          Chinese, I’m Chinese. I’m so
          Chinese, I’m an economics
          professor with lactose
          intolerance.

                        KERRY
          Yeah, but you grew up here.
               (in Mandarin;
                subtitled)
          Ni kan qilai shi huaren, ni jiang

          impression.

Amid the hectic bustle, Nick and Rachel exit a taxi. An
airport sign behind them reads: Kuwait Airways, Pacific
Asian Airlines, Qatar Airways, Malaysian Airlines, Cathay
Pacific.

          Okay, game plan. Check our bags,
          get through security, and then we
          could eat one of the three
          homemade Tupperware meals my mom
          packed for us.

An elegant PACIFIC ASEAN AIRLINES FLIGHT ATTENDANT
approaches, flanked by TWO PORTERS with luggage carts.

                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Good afternoon, Mr. Young, Ms.
          Chu. We’ll take your bags and get
          you checked into first class.

                        NICK
          Great.

Rachel looks confused as the porters take their bags.

                        RACHEL
          Oh. No, there's a mistake. We're
          not first class. We’re economy
          people.

                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          This way, please.

Nick puts a hand in the small of her back:

                        NICK
          Just go with it. Come on.

                        RACHEL
          But...
                        NICK
          Yeah, they’ll be fine.   Just leave
          them there.


INT. PLANE - ON NICK - DAY

FLIGHT ATTENDANT #2 pulls back a gold, silk curtain
revealing a luxurious part of the plane that looks more
like a hotel. Another attendant serves them champagne.

                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT #2
          Welcome aboard, Mr. Young, Ms.
          Chu. Here’s the way to your
          private suite. And some
          champagne.

They walk up to a full bar where champagne is poured for
them. Rachel turns to Nick like “what’s going on?”

huge flatscreen TVs, even a full-length wardrobe.

          You’re welcome. After takeoff,
          would you like to enjoy the lounge
          chairs or should we convert your
          suite into a bedroom?

Rachel clobbers Nick with a bag to keep him from
responding.

                        RACHEL
          Uh, we’re good. Thank you.

                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT #2
          Enjoy.

Nick looks to Rachel.

The Flight Attendant leaves. As Nick settles in, Rachel
looks at the complimentary pajamas.

                        RACHEL
          Nick. We can’t afford this.
          These pajamas are fancier than any
          of my real clothes.
                       NICK
          Hmm? My family has business with
          the airline. The tickets, they’re
          a perk.

Rachel senses there’s more to this.   Pursues it:

                        RACHEL
          What kind of business?

                        NICK
          Real estate, investment, other
          things. Nothing interesting.
               (reading menu)
          Dim sum.

                        RACHEL
          So your family is, like, rich?

          That is exactly what a super rich
          person would say. It’s not a big
          deal, obviously. I just think
          it’s kind of weird that I had no
          idea. I mean, you have a Jamba
          Juice card, you use my Netflix
          password. You play basketball at
          that Y that kind of smells.

Nick sees Rachel is a little thrown.

                        NICK
          I really like that place, thank
          you very much. And yes, my family
          has money, but I’ve always thought
          of it as theirs. Not mine.

                        RACHEL
          I get that. But I’m going all the
          way over there to meet them...
          Kind of just wanna know what I’m
          getting into. And, you know,
          they’re your family.

                        NICK
          Well... My family is much like
          anybody else’s. There’s half of
          them that you love and respect,
          and then there’s the other half.

Buxom Heroine KITTY PONG (20s, DD implants) runs into the
arms of Alistair. She speaks with a GIRLY TAIWANESE
ACCENT.

                        KITTY
          Alistair. You like it? I was
          feeling very... very the emotions.
          Can you feel it?

Kitty grabs his hand and places it forcefully on her
boob.

                        ALISTAIR
          Oh, I can feel all of you.    And
          all of me.

Alistair grabs Kitty’s left thigh and yanks it up onto
his hip. The DIRECTOR and Hero/Actor have an aside. On
the back of the chair “TAIPEI TIGER 2.”

They look on as Alistair and Kitty make out.

Nick and Rachel continue their conversation.

                           RACHEL
             Okay, and what about your cousin
             Eddie? You don’t ever talk about
             him.

                           NICK
             Well, Eddie is a big finance guy
             in Hong Kong. A real family man.

INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT (HONG KONG) - MORNING

Eddie, his wife FIONA CHENG (30s, Hong Kong Chinese, in a
simple but elegant dress), and their three sons (all
under 8 and wearing matching Gucci outfits) are frozen in
“natural” poses -- Eddie and Fiona “laugh” as their boys
“play” with wooden airplanes that look more like props
than toys -- as photographer RUSSELL WONG takes their
portrait. Behind them, wide, floor-to-ceiling windows
frame a panoramic view of Hong Kong.

             more natural.
                           EDDIE
             No, this way you get our optimal

                           RUSSELL WONG
             Uh, then we’re done.

As Russell wraps up, Eddie scurries over, all smiles.

                           EDDIE
             Russell, thank you so much. It’s
             an honor to be photographed by

             Thank you, Russell.

Eddie beams, but the moment Russell and his ASSISTANTS
exit, Eddie loses his smile. Turns on his wife, annoyed.

                           EDDIE
             Hong Kong Vogue? I knew it. Your
             dress is a disaster. If you wore
             a Bottega gown, like I told you
             to, we’d be in the American Vogue.

                           FIONA
             You can wear that gown to Hell,
             Eddie.

Fiona walks off as the children jump into 2 TOY BENTLEYS

                           NICK
             Astrid is awesome. And she’s
             probably the only one I’m actually
             close with. And she’s really
             grounded and down to earth once
             you get to know her.

ASTRID (30s), striking, enters a LUXE HIGH-END BOUTIQUE
where WEALTHY FEMALE CUSTOMERS look over FINE JEWELRY.

                        NICK (V.O.)
          Not only did she graduate top of
          her class at Oxford, start
          multiple charities and is a
          fashion icon, Astrid has the
          biggest heart of any of my
          cousins.

Astrid sees a LITTLE GIRL, the daughter of a customer,
holding a TINY, STUFFED BUNNY with a YARN BOW as she tugs
on her mother’s sleeve.

                         LITTLE GIRL
          Mummy?   See what I made for bunny --

But her mother waves her away, busy looking over baubles
with her friend.

                        LITTLE GIRL’S MOTHER
          No, not now, not now.

But the customers, including the Little Girl’s mother,
soon notice Astrid and sneak looks and whisper to one
another about her.

Astrid walks by them and goes to the Little Girl, much to
her mother’s surprise.

                        ASTRID
               (bends down; to Girl)
          Hi, I’m Astrid. What’s your name?

                         LITTLE GIRL
          Vita.

                        ASTRID
               (re: bunny)
          And who’s this?

                         LITTLE GIRL
          Bun-Bun.

                        ASTRID
          Well, I think Bun-Bun looks very
          dashing with his bow. You have a
          good eye.

                         LITTLE GIRL
          Thank you.

The Little Girl BEAMS, delighted.   The girl’s MOTHER
lights up, proud.

          Ms. Leong, right this way.

                        ASTRID
          It’s very nice to meet you both.

The patrons watch Astrid and the Jeweler disappear
through a hallway into a restricted area...


INT. JEWELRY STORE - BACK ROOM - DAY

It’s a private room reserved for elite clientele. An
ASSISTANT brings Astrid tea in a tiny antique cup as she
surveys A STUNNING SELECTION OF OVER-THE-TOP JEWELRY.

                        JEWELER
          These are all brand new from
          Antwerp. You’re the first person
          I’ve shown them to.

Astrid is unimpressed. Then she sees in ANOTHER DISPLAY
CASE an understated pair of pearl drop earrings. She
looks at them, intrigued.

                        ASTRID
          What are those?

The Jeweler smiles, approving of Astrid’s taste. He
takes the earrings out so she can get a closer look.

                        JEWELER
          Those. Those are very special.
          Burmese pearl drop earrings. Set
          with emeralds, and rare pigeon-
          blood-red rubies. They were worn
          by Queen Supayalat at her self-
          anointed coronation in 1878.

The assistant brings the earrings to Astrid.   She picks
them up to look closer, intrigued.

                          ASTRID
          How much?

                        JEWELER
          Having you wear one of my pieces
          is better publicity than I can
          buy. I’ll let them go at cost.
               (beat)
          One point two million.

Astrid gives a subtle nod.

                                                         24.


INT. PLANE - NIGHT

The plane is now in the air and Nick and Rachel’s suite
has been converted into a bedroom. They wear the
complimentary pajamas as they lie in bed, continuing
their conversation about Nick’s family.

                        RACHEL
          So, if you have all this family
          there, why are we staying in a
          hotel? Aren’t good Chinese sons
          supposed to stay with their
          parents?

                        NICK
          Well, because A) I’m not that good
          a son, and B) I just want you to

waist. Behind her is a ruggedly handsome man, COLIN

tissue packets holding a place for all of them.

          Ooh!   Look at this.     Look at this.

SAME SCENE - LATER

The table is OVERFLOWING with various dishes.

                         RACHEL
          Hmm.

                         COLIN
          There he is.   Nice.

                        NICK

Nick hands each of them mug of beer.

                        NICK
          One of those for you.

          Yes! I told you! I told you.

Araminta and Colin grin with approval.

                        COLIN
          All right, dig in, guys.

                         ARAMINTA

          Oh, before I forget, I need your

          some groomsmen stuff and I don’t
          wanna do it alone with Bernard
          Tai.

                        NICK
          I still cannot believe that you
          got that guy to be your groomsman.

          Thank you.    Thank you.   I rest my

          Well, it wasn’t up to me, was it?
          It’s not my choice. Bernard is

          You beat somebody up?

                        NICK
          Hold on -- I threw a single punch.
          I fell on the floor and the guy
          sat on me. So, wasn’t really much
          of a fight.

                         COLIN
                (raises glass)
          A toast, guys. To my best man,

          back!

          Thank you.

Colin and Nick continue to laugh and reminisce.

          Listen, Rachel, I know we’ve only
          just met, but it’s my bachelorette
          party this weekend and I would
          love for you to come.

Rachel is surprised, happy to be embraced by Nick’s pals.

EXT. CITY

The four of them driving down the highway in the open-top
SUV enjoying the beautiful city. Nick points to various
landmarks with glee. We see a MONTAGE of beautiful
fountains, boats going under bridges, etc. The girls, in
the back seat, put their arms around their guys’ necks
and snuggle.

INT. ASTRID’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Astrid enters, followed by the porters. The apartment
isn’t enormous, but each room is straight out of the
pages of Architectural Digest. TWO MAIDS quickly swing
into action, taking the bags and unpacking them.

                         ASTRID
          All right.   You know what to do.
          Quickly.

                       MAID
          Okay. Put over here.   Okay...
          Move, move.

The Maids nod, knowing the drill. The head Maid hides
two bags labeled “Dior” and “Lotus - Arts de Vivre” in a
drawer. The begin scurrying around the apartment in a
frenzy.


SERIES OF QUICK CUTS

-- One maid puts a small jewelry-sized box tied with a
bow in a metal tin and places the lid back on.

-- Another maid stashes a small box in a kitchen drawer
and covers it with the cloth napkins.

-- In the bathroom, Astrid takes off her EARRINGS, puts
them back in their original box and places the box above
the mirror.


INT. ASTRID’S APARTMENT - CASSIAN’S ROOM - NIGHT
Astrid lies by her son, CASSIAN (3), who’s half-asleep in
bed as she reads The Little Prince to him in French.

Astrid pauses when she hears SOMEONE enter the apartment.
She looks to Cassian, now sound asleep, and heads out.

Astrid’s husband, former Army Sergeant, and ripped/hot as

                              RACHEL
          Aw!     Peik Lin!

                        PEIK LIN
          What up, bitch? Yeah!        Yeah!

                          RACHEL
          Oh, my God!    You look amazing.

                          PEIK LIN
          I know.    Some things never change,
          right?

          And this is q-- quite a place.

SIX GOLDEN-HAIRED PEKINGESE DOGS run out, their high-

          Astor! Vanderbilt! Rockefeller!
          Naughty, naughty boys, stop

          Hi!

NEENAH GOH (50s), Peik Lin’s mother, comes out.    A short
woman with a bouffant perm.

She wears a tight blouse, a belt of interlinked gold
Medusa heads, tight trousers, and pink slippers.
                        NEENAH
          Singapore is so hot. Come in and
          enjoy the aircon. Come, come on.
          Whole family waiting to meet you.
          Very excited.

They head into:


INT. GOH HOUSE - DAY

Neena and Peik Lin show Rachel into the cavernous living
room, everything is covered with gold or mirrors. Rachel
takes it in, amazed.

                        NEENAH
          Rachel, welcome, welcome.

          Wow! Oh, my gosh! Your house is
          amazing, Mrs. Goh.

                        NEENAH

          Call me Auntie. Auntie Neenah.

                          RACHEL
          Sorry.    Auntie Neenah.

                        NEENAH
          Oh, yeah. Uh... Yeah, yeah, yeah,
          yeah. We were inspired by the
          Hall of Mirrors in Versailles.

                         PEIK LIN
                (to Rachel; low)
          And Donald Trump’s bathroom, as
          well.

                          RACHEL
          Really?

                          PEIK LIN
          Yeah.

                        NEENAH
          You like it or not?

                       RACHEL
          Oh, yes. Uh, the gold is very
          brilliant.


INT. GOH HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

SEVEN MEMBERS of the Goh family sit at a long dining
table as four maids serve the anything-but-”small” lunch.
It’s a free-for-all as everyone reaches for food.

It’s a colorful bunch. There’s Peik Lin’s father WYE MUN
(50s), and a multitude of children including: P.T. (30s)
shy, overweight, TWO ADORABLE TWIN GIRLS who eat CHICKEN
NUGGETS from a TAKEOUT BOX on heavy, gold-rimmed Limoges
plates, and a BABY in a TRICKED-OUT GOLD BASSINET. Neena
waves chopsticks at Rachel.

          Uh, uh, uh. Rachel Chu, we are
          so, uh, grateful for all the help
          you have given my, uh, Peik Lin
          back in her uni days. I mean,
          without you, uh, she would be a
          hot mess.

He chuckles.

                        RACHEL
          Oh, my God, no. Actually, if it
          wasn’t for her, I’d be a big mess.
          She was a huge help to me in
          college.
               (beat)
          It’s nice to meet you, Mr. Goh.

                        WYE MUN
          Nice to meet you, too, uh, Chu.
          Ku-ku. Ku-Chu. You. Poo-poo.
               (laughs)
          No, I’m just kidding. I don’t
          have an accent. I’m just messing
          with you.

Neenah chuckles.

                        WYE MUN
          No, no, I, I studied in the
          States, too. Yeah, Cal State
          Fullerton. Yeah. I majored in
          Thought.

                          RACHEL
          Hmm.
                        NEENAH
          Don’t stand on ceremony, Rachel.
          This is simple food, lah.

                          WYE MUN
          Ah!    Cha-cha-cha. Don’t be shy.

                          RACHEL
          Oh.    Thank you.

                        WYE MUN
          You’re not a model.

                        RACHEL
          I am definitely not.

Rachel looks at thirteen different dishes, which look
anything but simple.

Wye Mun puts food on Rachel’s plate. Neena feeds her dog
with chopsticks sitting in a chair next to her.

          No, you’re not. Not at all.
          You’re far from it.

                        RACHEL
          I know.

                        WYE MUN
          And make sure you eat it all.
          ‘Cause I’m watching you.

           RACHEL                       WYE MUN
Okay, thank you.              Okay, yeah.

        TWIN GIRL #1                  TWIN GIRL #2
Ah pa, can we go              ... go trampoline.
trampoline!

                        WYE MUN
          Ay, you haven’t finished your
          nuggets yet, sweetie. Okay,
          there’s a lot of children starving
          in America, right? I mean, take a
          look at her. She’s American.
          Huh? Really skinny. You wanna
          look like that?

                        TWIN GIRL #1 AND #2
          No.

                        WYE MUN
          Then eat your nuggets.
The girls dutifully return to their food.

                        NEENA
          So, Rachel, what you do in
          America?

                        RACHEL
          Um, I’m an economics professor.

                        WYE MUN
               (impressed)
          Whoa. Very impressive. Econ
          professor, eh? Wow! You must be
          very smart. Good for you.

                        RACHEL
          Mm-hmm.

          Let me get this straight. You
          both went to the same school, yet
          someone came back with a degree
          that’s useful. And the other came
          back as Asian Ellen.

Peik Lin reacts, grandpa laughs.    Wye Mun turns to his
son, P.T.

                        WYE MUN
               (nods toward Rachel)
          Psst. P.T.

                         P.T.
          Hmm?

                        WYE MUN
               (nodding toward
                Rachel)
          Look over here. She’s a hottie.
          This is the kind of girl you
          should date. Smart, beautiful.
          Not those, like, K-Pop skanks,
          with, like, no brain, big eyes and
          small backsides. She has an
          amazing backside. This is Goh
          standard. Don’t be shy. Just
          talk to her.

P.T. looks up from his noodles, clueless.

                        P.T.
               (whispering)
          I love you.
                         WYE MUN
          Okay.   No, just, uh...

                        PEIK LIN
          Pa, she’s here with her boyfriend.

                        WYE MUN
          I don’t see no ring on her finger.

                        RACHEL
          Oh, well, my boyfriend’s actually
          from Singapore and that’s why
          we’re here. We’re here to go to
          his best friend’s wedding where
          he’s gonna be the best man.

                         WYE MUN

          What’s his name? This is a very
          small island. Maybe we know his
          family.

                        RACHEL
          His name is Nick Young.

The food drops out of Wye Mun’s mouth. The whole table
STOPS EATING. Eyes go wide. Jaws drop. Even grandpa and
the twins stop what they’re doing and look at Rachel.
Rachel becomes self-conscious.

                        RACHEL
          Uh...

                        PEIK LIN
          The Nick you’re dating is Nick
          Young?!

          His best friend... You’re invited
          to Colin Khoo’s wedding, ah?!!

                       RACHEL
          Yeah. You guys know them or
          something?

P.T. snaps a quick pic of Rachel on his cell.   He smiles
and admires it like it’s the Mona Lisa.

                         WYE MUN
          Hells yeah. The Khoos, the
          Youngs, I mean, who doesn’t know
          who they are?!
               (getting worked up)
          They’re just the biggest
          developers in all of Singapore.
          And Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei,
          New Mexico.

                        PEIK LIN
          She gets it.

          Colin and Araminta’s wedding is,
          like, Singapore’s event of the
          century! The Youngs are like

Wye Mun vigorously shakes his head, “yes.”

          I don’t really know what they’re --
          I, I mean, I haven’t met them yet.
          I’m gonna meet them tonight. I’m
          going to Nick’s grandma’s house.

                        PEIK LIN

          house wearing this?

          Wearing that?

They all laugh.

          No way.   No way.

                        RACHEL
          Yeah, I thought red was a lucky
          color, right?

                        WYE MUN
          Yeah, if you’re an envelope.
          Zing! Nailed it!

P.T. takes another picture of Rachel, but she waves him
off.

                         RACHEL
          No.

                         TWINS

Peik Lin looks Rachel up and down, shaking her head
disgusted with her outfit.


INT. PEIK LIN’S BEDROOM - CLOSET - DAY

Peik Lin throws open the doors to her massive walk-in
closet. Clothes are color-coded, wrapped in plastic,
with a string of POLAROIDS over them showing the
different looks. Rachel looks around, in awe.

                        PEIK LIN
          Rachel, these people aren’t just
          rich, okay. They’re crazy rich.

Peik Lin looks around, pulls out a LARGE HANDBAG with a
WORLD MAP on it, which she points to as she explains:

          Billionaires, the Taiwan Tycoons.
          But the Young family, they’re old
          money rich. They had money when
          they left China in the 1800s. And
          they went all the way down here.
          Not there. Here. They came to
          Singapore when there was nothing
          but jungle and pig farmers. There
          was a snake here, eating an apple.
          You know what I mean? And they
          built all of this. Now, they’re
          the landlords of the most
          expensive city in the world. Here
          you go.
               (hands Rachel the
                purse)
          These people are so posh and
          snobby, they’re snoshy. Here you
          go.

Peik Lin hands her a pair of platform shoes.

                        RACHEL
          Yeah, but Nick’s not like that.

                        PEIK LIN
          Even if he isn’t, I guarantee you
          the family is. Which is why
          tonight, you need to not look like
          Sebastian of The Little Mermaid.
          You know, little crab guy.

Peik Lin throws her a dress...

          We’re here for the party, and
          we’re... We come in peace.

                        RACHEL
          Do you know where the Young family
          house is?

Another man appears at Rachel’s window.    These are
uniformed SIKH GUARDS.

                         RACHEL
          Nicholas Young? I’m, I’m Rachel
          Chu. I’m here to, to go to his
          family dinner.

The one guard carrying a rifle creeps around the car,
inspecting it. The other speaks on his walkie-talkie.

                        PEIK LIN
          Uh, Rachel Chu for the list.     If
          there is a list.


EXT. TYERSALL GROUNDS/AUDI - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

In the middle of nowhere, a MASSIVE GATE looms with
TYERSALL PARK written across the top. The gate is
closed. The guard on the walkie walks to the gate
looking back at Peik Lin and Rachel.

                        PEIK LIN
          He’s on the phone. He’s on the
          phone. Is that a gun knife? It’s
          a knife gun. It’s a --

The other guard now comes around to Peik Lin’s window.
                        PEIK LIN
          Okay, and there’s a friend.     Hi!
          Very, very nice to --

Guard #1 motions for them to drive forward.

                         GUARD #1
          Uh-huh.   Yeah, yeah.

                        PEIK LIN
          We can go through? We’re going
          through? Okay. Don’t stab the
          car.

The gates swing open.

                         PEIK LIN
          Okay.   Thank you. Bye!
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                      48.
CONTINUED:

As Peik Lin drives through the gates, she and Rachel look
around, entranced. STREET LIGHTS/LANTERNS illuminate
both sides of the large driveway, which seems to wind
endlessly up through a hilly rainforest. Unlike the rest
of developed Singapore, it feels old, untouched. Peik
Lin has her mouth hanging open, amazed.

                        RACHEL
          Oh, my God, it’s beautiful.

The forest finally gives way to rolling grounds and an
avenue lined with tall palms. A VAST COLONIAL MANSION
comes INTO VIEW. This is not a house, it is a palace.

                        PEIK LIN
          Beautiful? It’s two hundred mil
          worth of real estate.
               (almost tearing up)
          ... It’s spectacular.

They drive up to the front of the house. Servants are
posted in various locations outside. Two of the servants
open the front doors and Nick, in a linen suit and
perfectly-tousled hair, walks out. Looking every bit the
prince of the manor.

                        PEIK LIN
               (awestruck)
          Damn, Rachel. He’s like the Asian
          ‘Bachelor.’

Nick walks up to the car and opens Rachel’s door.

                        NICK
          Hello, gorgeous.
He takes her hand as she exits the car.   Nick looks at
her outfit, impressed.

                        NICK
          Wow! I think I’ve just fallen in
          love with you all over again.

He kisses her -- Peik Lin clears her throat.

                          RACHEL
          I missed you.

                        NICK
          Missed you, too.

Peik Lin keeps clearing her throat, trying to get
Rachel’s attention.

          It was fun! I got to meet Peik
          Lin’s whole family, and her dogs.

Nick and Rachel continue to chit-chat in the b.g. --

                          NICK
          Yeah?

                        RACHEL
          Yeah, and twin sisters.     And Peik
          Lin dressed me.

Peik Lin jumps out, pops the trunk, and sorts through
several outfits covered in garment bags labeled:
“Clubbing,” “Cocktail,” and “Walk of Shame.”

                           PEIK LIN
                  (re: “Walk of
                   Shame”)
          Nope.

She pulls out the COCKTAIL DRESS and a pair of HEELS.

                        RACHEL
          You have a cocktail dress in your
          trunk?

                        PEIK LIN
               (of course)
          I’m not an animal, Rachel.

As they head in, Rachel and Peik Lin look around at all
the guests --

                        RACHEL
               (to Nick)
          I thought this was just a family

          Grandmother’s invited some of her
          friends over tonight. Her tan
          huas are blooming.

          Oh.

Rachel nods.   Servants open the doors.   Holding her hand,
they enter:


INT. TYERSALL PARK - NIGHT

Chanteuse JASMINE CHEN, backed by a JAZZ BAND, sings a
Chinese number as Rachel, Nick, and Peik Lin enter.

                        PEIK LIN
          Oh, damn, Nick. It’s a party,
          though. Okay.

Many guests mingle and talk in the b.g.

 WOMAN IN RED FLOWER DRESS           WOMAN IN BLUE DRESS

Hello. Mrs... Mrs...

          stairs, and you can get changed in
          there.

                        PEIK LIN
          Okay, good, I’ll find it.    Thank
          you.

Peik Lin climbs the stairs, then stops to take a SELFIE,
climbs a few more stairs, and takes another SELFIE.

                        RACHEL
          You know, when you said you grew
          up in your grandma’s house, I
          wasn’t expecting this.
A waiter approaches carrying finger bowls with flowers
floating in them. Rachel thinks they are drinks and
begins to bring one to her mouth --

          And like the rolling green hills.

Rachel is looking at A STUFFED TIGER, mouth open, about
to pounce.

                        RACHEL
          And a giant tiger.

Nick laughs.

INT. TYERSALL PARK - KITCHEN - NIGHT

The DISTANT JAZZ RIFF CONTINUES as we ENTER a bustling
scene with MAIDS plating food, choppers chopping veggies
madly, COOKS working over WOKS that BURST INTO FLAME,
CHILDREN sneaking snacks. Amidst it all is Eleanor in
Carolina Herrera, presiding over everything. She
inspects various dishes, dispatching orders with calm
authority:

          too thick. Watch it, don’t make
          it too soft. Add chili... Ten
          minutes only.]

She’s clearly used to running a great house and being
obeyed. She pauses when she sees Nick enter. She’s
delighted, but keeps her composure.

Nick gives his mother a peck on the cheek.

                        NICK
          Mum.

Eleanor affectionately touches his hair.

                        ELEANOR
          You need a haircut. So unkempt.
               (concerned)
          And you look tired from your trip.
          I’m gonna ask the cook to make you
          some herbal soup.

Eleanor smiles, subtly scans Rachel, evaluating her.

          I’m very glad to finally meet you,
          too. And I’m sorry Nick’s father
          couldn’t be here. He was called

          Um, I teach Economics.

                        NICK
          And she’s brilliant. NYU’s
          youngest faculty member.

To Nick and Rachel’s surprise, Eleanor suddenly leaves
the conversation to inspect a tray of hors d’oeuvres.
She fixes the tray and then returns.

          Are your parents academics, as
          well?

                         RACHEL
          Uh, no. Well, my dad actually
          died before I was born and, um, my
          mom didn’t even go to college.
          She actually hardly spoke any
          English when she immigrated to the

          But she worked really hard, and

Nick glances at his mother, gauging her reaction.

                        ELEANOR
          Self-made woman. She must be so
          proud of you.

Eleanor continues fiddling and fussing with the table,
inspecting the food, coldly turning her back on the
couple.

                        RACHEL
          Well, she knows that I’m
          passionate about what I do, and
          she’s always wanted that for me.

                        ELEANOR
          Pursuing one’s passions. How
          American. Well, your mother is
          very open-minded, not like here,
          where parents are obsessed with
          shaping the life of their
          children.

It sounds like a compliment, but Rachel isn’t entirely
sure. Eleanor turns away again to talk to a passing COOK
before returning to Rachel:

Eleanor shoots Nick a look. He shifts, uncomfortable,
and is relieved to hear a MUSICAL GONG from upstairs.

                          NICK
          Hmm.   Oh.   That’s dinner.
                       ELEANOR
          Hmm. Go ahead. I’ll be out in a
          minute. Rachel, it was lovely
          meeting you.

                         RACHEL
          Thank you.   You, too.

Rachel smiles as she and Nick head off.

                        RACHEL
          Okay, she hates me.

                        NICK
               (optimistic)
          She takes a little minute to warm
          up, but we’ll get there.

OFF Eleanor, watching Rachel leave...

                                                       56.


INT. TYERSALL PARK - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rachel and Nick enter. She is stunned. The expansive
“living room” looks more like a glamorous club in
Shanghai. DOZENS of impeccably-dressed, bejeweled GUESTS
cluster in seating areas. A buffet is STACKED with
gorgeous dishes and desserts.

                          ASTRID (O.S.)
          Nicki!

                          NICK
          Astrid.

                          ASTRID
          Rachel!

                        NICK
          Hey, good to see you.

                        ASTRID
          I’m so glad you could make it.

As we GO TO different tableaus and conversations, CAMERA
DANCES ALONG, giving the feel of a choreographed number.

Astrid, in a perfect cocktail dress, heads for them,
followed by Michael. She hugs Nick and Rachel,
delighted.

                          NICK
          Michael.

                          RACHEL
          Astrid!    So good to see a face I
          know.
                          MICHAEL
          Nick.

                        ASTRID
          This is my husband, Michael.

                        MICHAEL
          Nice to meet you. Heard so much
          about you.

                        RACHEL
          Nice to meet you, Michael.

Eddie barrels in, smacks Nick too hard on the back.

                        EDDIE
          Hey, the golden boy’s back! Nick!
               (to Rachel)
          And you must be Rachel. I’m
          Edison Cheng. This is my wife.

                           FIONA
          HI, I’m Fi--

                        EDDIE
          Her name is Fiona. So, I see
          you’ve already met Princess Astrid
          and her little soldier toy-boy,
          Mikey.
               (busts Michael’s
                 balls)
          You know Mikey is a big-shot tech
          startup guy. So if you, uh,
          forget your password, he’s your
          man.
               (then)
          So, you’re from the Taiwan plastic
          Chus, right?

                        RACHEL
          Oh, well, actually...

As Eddie commandeers Rachel, Michael has an aside with
Nick.

                        MICHAEL
          Can I punch him in the face?   Just
          once.

                           NICK
          Take a number.
                        MICHAEL
          I’ll be in my usual corner.
               (to Astrid)
          Champagne?

                           ASTRID
          Thank you.

Astrid goes over to Nick.

                        ASTRID
          So, have you prepped Rachel to
          face the wolves?

                        NICK
          Rachel is a New Yorker, and she
          lectures Millennials for a living.
          I think she can manage our family.

Astrid looks at Nick like he’s crazy.

                        ASTRID
          You’ve been away too long.


BACK WITH RACHEL AND EDDIE

                        EDDIE
          Okay, sorry, time out. So, you’re
          not from a Taiwan Chu family?

                        RACHEL
          Nope.

                        EDDIE
          Hong Kong telecom Chus?

                        RACHEL
          No.

                        EDDIE
          Malaysian packing peanut Chus?

                        RACHEL
          Is that really a thing?

                        EDDIE
          Yeah, it’s everywhere.    You just --

Before Eddie can continue, Nick cuts in.

                        NICK
          I’m gonna stop you there because
          I’m gonna take her on the rounds.
          We’ll be back, though.
As Nick and Rachel leave, Eddie calls after.

                        EDDIE
          No, wait. Hang on. China instant
          noodle Chus. Rachel...
               (as Rachel turns)
          Chu are you?
               (to Fiona)
          Let’s go.

Eddie laughs hysterically at his own horrible joke.
Rachel politely smiles and moves on.

Francesca and Celine hover nearby to listen in and get
the dirt on Rachel.

                                                        59.


PARTY SEQUENCE

The jazz band breaks into a DRUM SECTION as Nick
introduces his family to Rachel, who’s anxious to make a
good impression. CAMERA DOES 360 LOOPS AROUND them,
REVEALING a new set of people each time:

-- WITH AUNTIES ALIX AND FELICITY:

                        NICK
          This is Auntie Alix and Auntie
          Felicity.

                        RACHEL
          Hi! It’s so nice to meet you.
          I’ve never been to a tan hua party
          before.

                        FELICITY
          We love any excuse to throw a
          soirée. Do your parents like to
          entertain? Oh! I’m sorry. Your
          mother’s single.

Alix shoots Felicity a “don’t be insensitive” look.

                        RACHEL
          Yup.

OFF Rachel, amused, realizing word has gotten around.


ON AUNTY JACQUELINE

                        NICK
          Auntie Jacqueline. One of my
          parents’ oldest friends.

                        JACQUELINE
          I actually met Nick’s father at
          Cambridge.
               (fishing)
          So, what line of work is your
          father in?

                        RACHEL
          Oh, my father died before I was
          born. But he was a factory worker
          in China.

Jacqueline slurps her wine loudly to drown out the horror
on her face.

In the b.g. Francesca and Celine overhear, smirk.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                        60.
CONTINUED:

-- An OLDER CHINESE LADY (60s) in traditional Chinese
dress, speaks to Nick, happy to see him.

                        LING CHEH (OLDER CHINESE LADY)
               (to Nick; in
                Mandarin; subtitled)
          Nicki a, shi ni nv pengyou a? Yao
          gankuai jiehun luo, a? [Nicki, is
          this your girlfriend? You should
          hurry up and get married, okay?]

Nick laughs.

Rachel smiles, assumes she’s Nick’s grandmother.

                        RACHEL
               (in Mandarin;
                subtitled)
          Ah Ma, xiexie nin yaoquing wo lai
          nin de jia. Zheli hao piaoliang.
          [Grandma, thank you for inviting
          me to your home. It’s very
          beautiful.]

The Older Lady looks at Rachel, confused.

                        NICK
               (low; to Rachel)
          This is Ling Cheh, my old nanny.

Rachel is mortified.   Francesca and Celine laugh in the
b.g.


INT. TYERSALL - LIBRARY - NIGHT
Astrid holds a covered plate, looks for Michael. She
sees him in the corner of the library, on his phone:

                        MICHAEL
               (into phone)
          Look, now’s the time we need all
          hands on deck. Please, please,
          just do me this favor. Thank you.
          Bye-bye.

He hangs up.

                        ASTRID
          They started clearing away dinner.

Astrid hands him the plate.

                        ASTRID
          Your favorites.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                    61.
CONTINUED:

Michael takes the plate, kisses her.

                         MICHAEL
           Thank you.

                         ASTRID
           You know, if you need bodies at
           the office, I could always come in
           and help out.

                         MICHAEL
                (playfully)
           The glamorous Astrid Leong working
           as an assistant?

                         ASTRID
           Mm-hmm.

                         MICHAEL
                (realizing)
           Wait, isn’t Araminta’s
           bachelorette party tomorrow?

                         ASTRID
           And this would be the perfect
           excuse to get out of it.

                         MICHAEL
           Thank you. Really. But I’ve got
           everything covered.

                         ASTRID
           Okay.
                (beat)
           I forgot to get you a fork.     Um...
                         MICHAEL
           It’s okay, you stay. I’ll go get
           it.

He winks at her and takes off. Astrid smiles as she
watches him go. She hears a BUZZ from his phone which
he’s left on the bench.

                         ASTRID
           Michael, I think it’s the office!

But Michael doesn’t hear her. He’s gone. There’s a PING
and a text pops up. She glances at the screen:

TEXT:   The bed feels empty without you.

Astrid is stricken.

Astrid drops the phone, her world caving in.

                                                       62.


BACK AT THE PARTY

Jacqueline and others in the b.g. subtly clock this. A
dapper man, OLIVER T’SIEN (30s), looks on with interest.

                        RACHEL
          Oh, my God! Nick, I can’t believe
          I just did that.

                        NICK
          It’s fine. I don’t think anybody
          even noticed.

                        RACHEL
          I think I freaked out your nanny --

She spills her drink down the front of Nick’s shirt.

                           NICK
          Oh!   My God!

                           RACHEL
          Oh, my God!     So sorry.

                        NICK
          It’s fine, don’t worry about it.
               (to bartender)
          Can I have a tissue, please?

Oliver swoops in offering a napkin.

                        OLIVER
          Oh, go, go. Get changed.    I’ll
          keep Rachel company.

Nick smiles to see him.
                        NICK
          Thanks you, Oli.
               (to Rachel)
          You’re in good hands. Give me two
          minutes. I’ll change.

                           RACHEL
          Sorry.

                           NICK
          It’s okay.

Nick takes off -- Rachel extends her hand to Oliver --

                        RACHEL
          Hi, I’m Rachel.

                           OLIVER
          Oh, I know.

Peik Lin scampers up.

                           PEIK LIN
          Rachel!

                           RACHEL
          Oh, I --

                        PEIK LIN
          Rachel! I heard you thought Ah Ma
          was the cook!

Rachel cringes and covers her face in embarrassment.

                           PEIK LIN
          Ah!

                        OLIVER
               (off Rachel)
          Uh, on the bright side, you’re the
          talk of the party. People like
          your dress.

Peik Lin and Oliver take each other in.    It’s instant
fashion chemistry.

                        PEIK LIN
          Oh, I did that.

                           OLIVER
          Oh!

                           PEIK LIN
          I know!

                        OLIVER
          Such a chic seventies goddess.

                           PEIK LIN
          I know.

                        OLIVER
          It’s very disco Cleopatra, but in
          a good way.

                        PEIK LIN
          That’s exactly what I was going
          for.

                           OLIVER
          Oh, well.     Oliver.

          I like your shoes.

                           PEIK LIN
          Oh, thank you.     I’m Peik Lin.
          Ditto.

                           OLIVER
          Cheers.

                           PEIK LIN
          There you go.

Rachel looks on, amazed Peik Lin’s already made a friend.

                        OLIVER
               (re: her earrings)
          Gosh, these are lovely.

                        PEIK LIN
          They’re clip-ons. Thank you.

                         OLIVER
          Are they?   Oh, wow!

                        RACHEL
          So, Oliver, are you a cousin, too?

                        OLIVER
          Mm, well, I’m one of the poorer
          relations. The rainbow sheep of
          the family. But I make myself
          useful. Whatever the Youngs want,
          I procure. Golden koi fish,
          Huanghuali furniture. A rare
          Cambodian gong.

                           PEIK LIN
          Mm.

                        RACHEL
          Why would they want to buy a rare
          Cambodian gong?

On cue, A RESONANT GONG sounds and all eyes turn to Alix.

                        OLIVER
          Because they can.

                                                      65.


INT. TYERSALL PARK - NICK’S OLD ROOM - NIGHT

Nick opens a closet, sees a row of meticulously pressed
shirts hanging in a row. He smiles, takes one out.
Eleanor walks in.

                        ELEANOR
          Ah Ma insists all your clothes be
          washed and pressed every two
          weeks.

Nick sees his mother standing in the doorway. She walks
over, takes the shirt from his hands and selects another
shirt for him. (Throughout the scene she also quietly
caters to Nick -- dusting his jacket, etc.)

                        ELEANOR
          This one.

As Nick takes off his soiled shirt he looks around at his
childhood room filled with pictures and mementoes.

                        NICK
          Everything is exactly as I left
          it.

Nick moves to a nearby desk and rifles through a drawer.

                        ELEANOR
               (glances over at him)
          Looking for your cigars? I had
          them thrown out years ago.

                        NICK
          Never could get anything past you,
          could I?
Eleanor smiles while she fiddles with Nick’s clean shirt
laying on the bed.

                        ELEANOR
          I keep telling Ah Ma to put your
          things away, but she says this
          room makes her feel like you’re
          still here.
               (then)
          Well, I got an earful when you
          didn’t move back last year.

Nick reacts, it’s a loaded subject.   Eleanor helps Nick
put on the clean shirt.

          Your father and I are really
          looking forward to having you
          home. He’s not getting any
          younger. With you onboard, maybe
          he’ll take a day off once in a
          while.

                        NICK
          I know, Mum. I’m just not ready
          yet. There’s things in New York
          that I wanna see through.

It’s not the answer Eleanor was looking for.    She presses
on another front:

                        ELEANOR
          Well, I’m happy I finally met
          Rachel. She is very impressive.

                        NICK
          I think so, too. And I thought
          you might be excited that the
          first girl that I bring home is a
          Chinese professor.

                        ELEANOR
               (noncommittal smile)
          Chinese-American.
               (fishes)
          You know, bringing her home,
          introducing her at a large family
          gathering... Some people may say --

                         NICK
          When there’s something to say
          about Rachel and me, you’ll be
          first to hear.
               (off Eleanor)
          But some things I need to figure
          out on my own.

Nick grins as Eleanor helps him put on his jacket.

                        ELEANOR
          Is that an American accent I’m
          hearing?

Nick scoffs.

                           NICK
          How do I look?

Eleanor adjusts the pocket square in his jacket pocket,
regards her son.

EXT. TYERSALL PARK - CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

Guests stream into a vast open-air courtyard. Alix and
Felicity hold court as guests admire the large, spidery,
white flowers which are STARTING TO BLOOM.

                        ALIX
          Everyone! Everyone! The tan hua
          plants very rarely bloom, and even
          then only at night.

                        FELICITY
          Their beauty is spectacular, but
          fleeting. By dawn they’ll be
          gone.

                          ALIX
          So... come.    Come.

The crowd claps. ZOOM IN ON the tan hua plant taking
center stage in the conservatory.


IN ANOTHER AREA

Oliver pretends to admire the flowers as he points out
the social scene to Peik Lin and Rachel.

                           OLIVER
          Oh!     Someone forgot to wear a bra.

He gestures to Kitty Pong, who’s entered with Alistair.
                        OLIVER
          Kitty Pong. Cousin Alistair’s
          latest flame. An actress. Rumor
          is, she was in a porno. Two
          Girls, One Cup a Noodles.

Kitty bends down to smell a tan hua, her boobs almost
spilling out of her dress. The Aunties are horrified.

                           KITTY
                  (kissing one of the
                   guests)

          that more than I did.

          Mm-hmm.

Rachel is distracted seeing some YOUNG WOMEN sneak cold
glances at her.

                         RACHEL
          Is it just me or are people, like,
          staring at me?

                        OLIVER
          Oh, they’re just jealous. You
          nabbed the crown prince.
               (off Rachel)
          Nicki is Ah Ma’s favorite, in line
          to inherit everything. No
          surprise there when that’s the
          competition.

Oliver looks to Eddie checking himself out on his iPhone
cam, and Alistair who’s hypnotized by Kitty’s cleavage.

Rachel is uncomfortable with the implication.

                        OLIVER
          Oh, speaking of the grande dame...

Rachel turns to see guests make way for an elderly lady,
Nick’s AH MA (80s). She’s regal, elegant, but frail,
leaning on Eleanor to help her walk. She doesn’t say a
word, but everyone, her own family included, acts in
total deference and respect to her.
As Rachel takes it in, feeling a little out of place.
Nick appears.

                        NICK
          There you are. I’ve been looking
          all over for you. You ready to
          meet my grandmother?

As Nick takes her by the hand and leads her through the
crowd --

They reach Ah Ma who LIGHTS UP to see her favorite
grandson. The veneer of decorum drops as she reaches out
to him, hugging him and touching his face.

                        NICK
          Ah Ma...

Valets load luggage onto sleek golf carts before

HELICOPTERS outside the hangar.


INT. HANGAR

In the middle of the hangar is a SLEEK HELICOPTER
surrounded by a circular bar, which divides the bachelors
from the bachelorettes.

Rachel and Nick enter the hangar as Araminta runs up to
them.

Araminta drags Rachel over to a group of girls. Rachel
gives Nick a last look as Araminta pulls her away:

Rachel and the women turn to see --

Araminta and the bachelorettes flock to the sisters,
leaving Rachel and another woman, AMANDA (30s). Unlike
Araminta’s other friends, Amanda doesn’t look or act like
a high-maintenance model.

          Yes.    Um, what, what about you?

          Oh, I’m a lawyer. General counsel
          to the Young Family Corporation,
          actually.

          That’s very impressive.

                        AMANDA
          Mm, nah. Just good old-fashioned
          nepotism. I grew up with Nick and
          Colin. We’re family friends.
               (then)
          It’s nice to meet you, Rachel Chu.

Rachel smiles, happy to find a like-minded friend. They
hear a BEEP BEEP as Araminta arrives in a golf cart.

          Takes a goddamn mastermind.

Colin looks out to see nothing but the ocean around them.

                        COLIN
          Where exactly is this party?

                        BERNARD
          It’s right there.

They all look out the window at a LARGE CARGO SHIP.
Colin and Nick exchange looks, WTF? But as they get
closer...

                         COLIN
          Bloody hell!

REVEAL: The containers on the ship have been arranged
and modified to create a HUGE PARTY PLAYGROUND. A
floating Disneyland for adults. Painted on the side is
“BALLIN’ COLIN’S BACHELOR PARTY.” The guys descend on
the scene.

                         BERNARD
          Y-y-yeah!

The partiers respond in kind welcoming them to the
revelry.


EXT. CARGO PARTY SHIP - NIGHT (LATER)
In a LONG SHOT we see a flare go off into the sky.   We
hear it enter the sea with a splash.


INT. SHIP PARTY

“Hello Bitches” by CL POUNDS.

STYLISTIC FLASHES as the guys walk past CARGO CONTAINERS
THAT HAVE BEEN CONVERTED into a POOL and DANCE FLOOR
manned by attractive MODEL WAITRESSES. Some of the women
wear beauty pageant-type sashes across their chests:
UKRAINE, UNITED KINGDOM, NETHERLANDS. Bernard, standing
in front of the beauty queens, is holding a bazooka-like
flare gun setting off another flare. He laughs
manically.

          Oh, my God, Nick. What are you
          worried about? You don’t have to
          keep Rachel happy. She’s just
          lucky to be here.

                           COLIN
          Nice, Eddie.

                        EDDIE
          Oh, what? So do we pretend like
          that’s not the truth? Are we in
          some kinda fairy tale story that I
          don’t know about? Did you find a
          shoe at midnight and jump in a
          pumpkin? Yo, I got so much shit
          about marrying Fiona and her
          parents own the biggest shipping
          company in Hong Kong.
               (to Colin)
          Hey, Araminta’s adorable, but you
          think your dad would be spending
          millions on this wedding if her
          parents didn’t own a billion-
          dollar resort chain? What’s
          Rachel bringing to the table?

Alistair sits with his arms wrapped around two women, one
wearing a sash labeled “ISRAEL.”

                           ALISTAIR
          Oh!     Small tits!
They all laugh.

Nick steps to Alistair, about to hit him, but Colin
stands in the way.

          Hey, hey, hey. It’s not worth it,
          man. They’re drunk.

lined with bikini-clad women.    Bernard yells toward Colin
and the guys --

                         BERNARD
          Hey, guys, this is boring.
          Massage time. And you, the
          bachelor. You gonna get one
          before this weekend is over. Or
          we gonna tie you up and shave your
          coo coo chara.

Everyone laughs uproariously as Bernard brandishes the
bazooka.

Bernard has a missile-type launcher on his shoulder --

          Shit!    Come try this.

Nick and Colin start walking away from the party.

                        COLIN

          now that he’s back, I’m sure all

words scrawled in red: “CATCH THIS, YOU GOLD-DIGGING
BITCH!”

          I’ll call security --

          No.

Astrid reacts, surprised.   Rachel pulls herself together.

                        RACHEL
          I’m not gonna make a scene.

ZOOM IN ON the window and the nasty message --

                        RACHEL
          I’m not gonna give them the
          satisfaction.


EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

The drunken bachelorettes dance as a DJ spins tracks.


FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH

Rachel rants as she and Astrid dig a HOLE in the sand.

                        RACHEL
          This weekend was supposed to be
          mani-pedis, cocktails served in
          pineapples. This definitely
          wasn’t on the menu --

Rachel dumps the wrapped fish in the hole.

                        RACHEL
          Why would Araminta even have
          friends like them? They're so
          mean.

As Rachel fills the hole:

                        ASTRID
          Well, you grow up your whole lives
          together, you make excuses for
          people. Specially the morons.

                        RACHEL
          I mean, I know Michael didn’t have
          to deal with catty, fish-killing
          sociopaths, but how did you two
          get through all this?

          Well, I didn't have it quite this
          bad, but it wasn't pretty.

                        RACHEL
          Well, at least tell me it gets
          better.

                        ASTRID
          Of course it does.

Astrid wants to reassure Rachel, but she can’t.   Rachel
recognizes that something is wrong.

                           RACHEL
          You okay?

                        ASTRID
          Yeah...
               (beat; close to
                tears)
          Actually... no...

                        RACHEL
          You could talk to me.

                        ASTRID
               (tough to say)
          Michael is... having an affair.

                        RACHEL
          I’m really sorry, Astrid.

Astrid manages a smile, appreciates it.

Rachel nods. Astrid smiles, puts her head on Rachel’s
shoulder, hold each other’s hands, and watch the waves
crash into the shore.


EXT. RAFFLES HOTEL - DAY

Nick enters the hotel --

                           MALE HOTEL GREETER
          Welcome back.

                           NICK
          Cheers, sir.

INT. RAFFLES HOTEL - LANDING - DAY

Nick enters the hotel having returned from his trip.   He
sees Rachel reading in a quiet area. He heads over,
throws his bag down.

                        RACHEL (O.S.)
          I thought I was here to meet your
          family...


ON NICK AND RACHEL

                        RACHEL
          ... go to your best friend's
          wedding, eat some good food.
          Instead, I feel like I'm a villain
          in a soap opera who's plotting to
          steal your family fortune.

Nick blanches.   Knows this isn’t good.

                           NICK
          What happened?

                        RACHEL
          I mean, I met Amanda. She told me
          that everyone here thinks that I'm
          the evil person that prevented you
          from moving back to Singapore last
          year but, when I didn't even know
          you were supposed to come home.

                        NICK
          You have every reason to be upset -
          -
                        RACHEL
          I’m not done yet! There was also
          the gutted, bloody fish that
          Araminta’s friends left for me in
          my hotel room on my bed next to
          the words ‘Catch this, you gold-
          digging bitch’... written in big
          fat serial-killer letters --

                         NICK
          Is that all that happened?
               (off Rachel)
          I mean, please tell me that’s all
          that happened.

          about those stupid girls, with
          their stupid little designer
          handbags and sunglasses. I don't
          care about that. I don't care
          that your ex-girlfriend told me
          all this crap. It's that you
          didn't tell me any of it.

                          NICK
          I screwed up.

                          RACHEL
          Why?

                        NICK
          I really messed up, okay?

                       RACHEL
          Why? What -- Were you trying to
          test me? Why would you do that?

Nick takes a beat, comes clean.

                        NICK
          I made a mistake. When we first
          met, you had no idea who I was,
          who my family were. You didn't
          care!

                        RACHEL
          Yeah, I don't care about that
          stupid stuff.

                        NICK
          Well, exactly. You are so
          different from all of the women
          that I grew up with. And I love
          who I am around you. And I don't
          want that to change. And that's
          selfish, I know.

Nick takes her hand.

                          RACHEL
          Mm-hmm.

                        NICK
          And I'm sorry that you had to deal
          with that on your own. But I'm
          here now. And whatever happens,
          we'll get through it together.
          Dead fish and all.

          It was so gross. But I buried it.

                        NICK
          You dealt with it.

They laugh.   He holds her.   Rachel is touched.

                         NICK
          Come here.

                        RACHEL

                         NICK
          100% agree.

          Yes.

                        NICK
          But... we do have to go make some
          dumplings first. Okay?

                        RACHEL
          Then can we eat them?

          Okay, fine.


INT. TYERSALL PARK - DINING ROOM - DAY

QUICK CUTS of food being expertly prepared by half a
dozen MAIDS:

-- Small balls of dough are rolled into flat circles.

-- Minced meat is quickly rolled into dozens of perfectly-
formed, uniform BALLS.

A maid takes a tray of the mincemeat balls to the center
of the room, where Eleanor and other family members --
Nick, Rachel, Astrid, Cassian, Oliver, Alix, and Felicity
-- are clustered around a large table. They’re busy
folding the dumplings, which are placed in neatly-stacked
bamboo steamers. It’s a family tradition, and they work
expertly while having multiple conversations.

                        NICK
          I can’t believe this is your first
          time making dumplings.

Rachel laughs.

                        ALIX
          Gotta make sure this time we don’t
          run out of baskets.

                        ASTRID
          Cassian, that’s not how you do it.
               (beat)
          Very good. Very good, Cassian.

Cassian laughs.

                        ASTRID
          And now you roll it up.

As Eleanor inspects the tray and nods her approval,
Felicity eyes DOZENS of waiting trays with alarm.

                        ALIX
          This is too much. We’re hosting a
          rehearsal dinner, not feeding an
          army --
                        ELEANOR
          Better too many than have people
          say we’re stingy.

Meanwhile, Nick teaches Rachel how to fold a dumpling --
putting the mincemeat ball in the dough wrapper and
sealing it closed.

                        NICK
          So, right. You put the baby in
          bed and tuck, tuck, tuck. Same on
          the other side. And you give him
          a kiss goodnight --

                        RACHEL
          Okay. That’s so cute.     And then
          you eat the baby.

          he's cooked.

                        RACHEL
          No, you gotta make sure he’s
          cooked. Did Ah Ma teach you that?

                        NICK
          She did.

                        OLIVER
          I, on the other hand, was taught
          by Grand Aunty Mabel. ‘You put
          the Botox in the face and then you
          pinch, pinch, pinch, then voila!’

                        RACHEL
          Did you guys all learn when you
          were kids?

                        ASTRID
          We didn’t have a choice.

Nods to Cassian as he happily pounds balls of dough with
his fist and rips apart dumplings.

                        FELICITY
          We taught you so you’d know the
          blood, sweat, and tears it took to
          raise and feed you monkeys.

                        ALIX
          Not like ang-mohs, microwaving
          macaroni and cheese for their own
          children.
               (shudders)
          No wonder they put their parents
          in the old folks’ home when they
          all grow up.

                        FELICITY
          I know!

                        ELEANOR
          Ah Ma says if we don’t pass
          traditions down like this, they’ll
          disappear.

The others all laugh --

          It’s totally worth it. Mother

          When I was growing up, it was just
          me and my mom. Which I loved, uh,
          but we didn’t really have a big
          family like this. It’s really
          nice.

          That's so lovely of you to say,
          Rachel. We all are very lucky to
          have each other.

Alix and Felicity smile, approving. Feeling more
comfortable, Rachel tries to engage Eleanor, who’s been
largely silent. She sees Eleanor’s RING, a beautiful
piece studded with diamonds and emeralds.

                        RACHEL
          That’s a beautiful ring, Aunty
          Eleanor. I’ve never seen anything
          like it.

The other women look at Eleanor, trying to gauge her
reaction to Rachel.

                        ELEANOR
               (surprised; then)
          Nick’s father had it made when he
          proposed to me.

                        RACHEL
          That’s very romantic.   How did you

                        NICK
          Actually, they met at Cambridge.
          They were both studying law
          together.

          Oh, I didn’t know you were a
          lawyer.

                        ELEANOR
          I wasn’t. I withdrew from
          university when we got married.

                        RACHEL
          Oh...

          I chose to help my husband run a
          business and to raise a family.
          For me, it was a privilege. But
          for you, you may think it's old-
          fashioned. It's nice you
          appreciate this house and us being
          here together wrapping dumplings.
          But all this doesn't just happen.
          It's because we know to put family
          first, instead of chasing one's
          passion.

An awkward SILENCE falls over the table.    Rachel feels
chided, isn’t sure how to react when:

          [Ah, everyone’s here!]

Ah Ma enters with her Thai maids. Oblivious to the
tension, she smiles to see Nick and Rachel.

                          NICK
          Ah Ma.

                          ASTRID
          Ah Ma.

                          ALIX
          Ah Ma.

                        NICK
               (to maids)
          Thank you.
               (takes his grandma’s
                 arm)
          Ah Ma.

                          AH MA
          Oh, Nick.

                          NICK
          Come and sit.

                        AH MA
               (in Mandarin;
                subtitled)
          O, Nicki. O, ni ba Rachel ye
          dailai le? [Oh, Nicki. You
          brought Rachel. Good.]

Ah Ma looks at Rachel’s face, scrutinizing it.
                                                 (CONTINUED)

          En... en... zhang de zhen haokan.
          Qingchu le. [Very nice looking.]

Rachel is unsure what to make of it, but it feels like
approval.

                        AH MA
               (in Mandarin;
                subtitled)
          Sit, sit, grandson.

                        OLIVER
          Right, right. We're almost done
          here. Just a few more baskets.

Ah Ma looks at the dumplings.

                        AH MA
               (to Eleanor; in
                Mandarin; subtitled)

          [You made those dumplings? They
          don’t look very good. You lost
          your touch.]

Astrid watches this exchange, then looks at Rachel.
                        ELEANOR
          Hmm.


INT. TYERSALL - HALLWAY - DAY

Rachel exits the dining room, looking for anywhere to go.
She walks up the long staircase, takes a few steps one
way, realizes she’s going the wrong direction, then turns
around to find Eleanor standing in front of her.

                        RACHEL
               (surprised)
          Oh. Hi. I think I’m a little
          lost. This house is pretty big.

Eleanor comes to Rachel and they walk and talk through
the halls of Tyersall.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                     96.
CONTINUED:

                        ELEANOR
          I’m glad I found you. I’m afraid
          that I’ve been unfair.

                        RACHEL
          Oh, no, you know what? I'm sorry
          I made an assumption. I didn't
          mean to offend you.

                        ELEANOR
          Not at all.
               (then)
          You asked about my ring. The
          truth is Nick’s father had it made
          when he wanted to propose to me,
          because Ah Ma wouldn’t give him
          the family ring. I wasn’t her
          first choice. Honestly, I wasn’t
          her second.

                        RACHEL
          Gosh, I'm so sorry. I had no
          idea.

                        ELEANOR
          I didn’t come from the right
          family, have the right
          connections. And Ah Ma thought I
          would not make an adequate wife to
          her son.

Rachel is surprised how Eleanor is seemingly opening up.

                        RACHEL
          But, she came around, obviously.
Eleanor gives a tight smile.

                         ELEANOR
          It took many years, and she had
          good reason to be concerned.
                (off Rachel)
          Because I had no idea the work and
          the sacrifice it would take.
          There were many days when I
          wondered if I would ever measure
          up --

Eleanor pauses, looks at Rachel.

                        ELEANOR
          But having been through it all, I
          know this much...
               (gets close; gently)
          You will never be enough.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                     97.
CONTINUED:

Rachel is eviscerated. Eleanor draws back, placid, calm.
Then, as if they’ve been talking about the weather
Eleanor walks off:

                        ELEANOR
          We should head back. I wouldn’t
          want Nick to worry.


INT. CAR - DAY

Nick drives as Rachel sits in the passenger seat, silent.

                           NICK
          You all right?

                           RACHEL
          Yeah.

                        NICK
          I know my mum can be tough at
          times, but there isn’t anything
          she wouldn’t do for me...
               (off Rachel’s
                silence)
          And there is a reason why I lived
          with Ah Ma growing up. It’s
          because my mother knew she wasn’t
          the favorite. So she let her
          raise me so I would be.

                        RACHEL
          You were just a kid?

                        NICK
          Yeah. But... It's hard to
          understand from the outside. But
          she did what she thought was best
          for the family... For everyone
          involved.

Rachel hears the tiny reminder of her otherness.

                           RACHEL
          Mm-hmm.

Rachel takes it in, hears Nick’s regard for his mother.
Which makes her feel even more unsettled.

                        NICK
          Anyway, I think I've had enough
          with dumplings for the rest of my
          life. What should we do? Sushi,
          movies, anything you like.
          Really.

                                                     98.


EXT. COFFEE SHOP - PATIO - DAY

                         PEIK LIN (O.S.)
          Wait, what?   Was she like --

TILT DOWN -- Peik Lin and Rachel sit at a table.

                         PEIK LIN
                (Eleanor impression)
          ‘You will NEVER be good enough for
          my son,’ OR was it like, ‘YOU, YOU
          will never be good enough for my
          son.’

                        RACHEL
          It’s like the second one.

                         PEIK LIN
          Oh.

                        RACHEL
          Except for in a way that made me
          wanna, like, cry and puke at the
          same time.

                        PEIK LIN
          God, she’s so badass.
               (idea)
          You know, I bet if you told her
          you’d leave Nick for a million
          dollars, she will write that
          check. They do that around here --

                        RACHEL
          -- And she looked at me like I was
          nothing...
                        PEIK LIN
          -- Like a ten million dollar
          check. I feel like she would do
          that.

                        RACHEL
          I don't even know what I should
          do. I mean, I can't even tell
          Nick because he like worships her.

                        PEIK LIN
          Yeah, Chinese sons think their
          moms fart Chanel No. 5. What
          about the Ah Ma? Does she hate
          your face, too?

                       RACHEL
         Okay, nobody said they hated my
         face. And Ah Ma, she liked my
         face. She said I had a lucky
         nose.

                       PEIK LIN
         That’s great! You know, Eleanor
         can hate you all day long, but you
         can’t beat two thousand years of
         Chinese filial piety.

                        RACHEL
         I feel like I shouldn't even go to
         the wedding. You know, it's Colin
         and Araminta's day, I don't wanna
         cause any drama there. I feel
         like I should just sit it out.
         You know? Tell Nick I had food
         poisoning or something.
               (off Peik Lin’s look)
         What?

                       PEIK LIN
         That’s bullshit. You’re just
         scared.

                        RACHEL
         No, I’m not.

                       PEIK LIN
         Okay, here's what you need to
         understand, all right? It's not
         about getting Eleanor to like you.
         It's about getting her to respect
         you. All right? Right now, she
         just thinks you're some like
         undeserving, clueless, gold-
         digging --

                       RACHEL
         Okay, yeah, I got it.

                       PEIK LIN
         -- trashy, unrefined banana,
         yellow on the outside, white on
         the inside --

                       RACHEL
         I know what a banana is --

                       PEIK LIN
         -- When in reality, you’re like a
         super sophisticated, smart
         professor of freaking game theory.

This hits home with Rachel.

                          RACHEL
          You’re right.

                        PEIK LIN
          Damn straight, I’m right. It’s
          Peik Lin, I’m always right.

                        RACHEL
          Yeah, she's like trying to play a
          game of chicken with me, where
          she's like coming at me, and like,
          thinking I'm going to swerve like
          a chicken.

                        PEIK LIN
          But you can't swerve.

                        RACHEL
          I'm not gonna swerve.      Not for
          her.

                         PEIK LIN
          No.   Chickens are bitches, dude!

                        RACHEL
          And I'm not a chicken

                        PEIK LIN
          You're not a chicken. You gonna
          roll up to that wedding, you gonna
          be like, ‘Bak-bak, bitch!’

          Chickens are bitches.

A man on one of the upper balconies overhears her, gives
her a disapproving look.

                          PEIK LIN
          Sorry Uncle.

                        RACHEL

          I have been waiting to do this
          properly for so long. I'm
          thinking eyebrow triage, root
          crimps, maybe some eyelid tape.

REVEAL OLIVER standing off to the side with his

INT. GOH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - ON RACHEL - DAY

Oliver and Neenah are accessorizing the sparkly disco-
type dress Rachel is now wearing.

When Rachel goes behind the partition to change her
outfit, Neenah, Wye Mun, P.T., and the twins all start
dancing to the music. Peik Lin’s parents get carried
away and start making out on the chaise lounge.

                                                    105.


EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - DAY

Eddie trails off as the photographers suddenly head to --

-- a custom GOLD BENTLEY MULSANE. It’s driven by Peik
Lin, who wears a fetching driver’s uniform. Seeing the
car, Oliver steps up as Peik Lin opens the door -- a
shapely stilettoed leg steps out. It’s RACHEL in a
glittering gown. Her hair is swept up, her jewelry
catches the light, she’s a VISION.

It’s an EXPLOSION OF FLASHES as photographers, reporters,
and looky-loos take pictures, yell to get her attention.
Rachel is a little overwhelmed, but Oliver helps navigate
her through the crowd.

                        NEENAH
          Just right here! Just right here!

          you? Lovely. Oh, fantastic.
          Looking gorgeous. Little closer
          together. Who's this one? What's
          your name?

                         PEIK LIN

A Photographer gestures for Celine to get out of the way
so he can take Rachel’s picture. OFF Celine, pissed.

INT. BENTLEY - DAY

Astrid and Michael, dressed for the wedding, sit in the
back of a chauffeured Bentley. Michael chatters on as
Astrid listens in silence.

                        MICHAEL
          -- Our Chinese investors are
          getting nervous. I have to fly to
          Shenzhen on Monday to try and talk
          them down.

This gets Astrid’s attention.

                        ASTRID
          That’s Cassian’s birthday.

                        MICHAEL
          Yeah, I know. I hate to miss it,
          but this is important.

                        ASTRID
          You’d think your son’s birthday is
          important. Get someone else to
          handle it...
               (can’t help herself)
          Unless... there’s another reason
          you’re out of town.

                        MICHAEL
          What are you saying?

Astrid presses a button on the console, RAISING THE
PARTITION between them and the driver.

                        ASTRID
          I know you’re having an affair.

Michael reacts, uncomfortable, but he doesn’t deny it.

                        MICHAEL
          Oh, Jesus, Astrid.

                        ASTRID
          Let’s just get through the wedding
          and we’ll deal with it after. I
          don’t want to make a scene.

Michael looks at her, incredulous.

                        MICHAEL
          You find out I’m having an affair
          with another woman, and you’re
          worried about making a scene?

                        ASTRID
          You’d rather I scream and carry
          on?

                        MICHAEL
          Yes. Honestly, I wish you would.
          It would show you cared about more
          than what people thought of you
          and your family --
                        ASTRID
          Don’t try and turn this on me.
          I’m not the one who screwed up!

                        MICHAEL
          Of course not. You’re always the
          prettiest, richest, most perfect
          girl in the room. While I’m just
          this lucky bastard who will never
          measure up.

                        ASTRID
          Don’t say that --

                        MICHAEL
          I know what you’re thinking,
          Astrid. That’s why you hide your
          shoes, the jewelry you buy.

                        MICHAEL (CONT'D)
          As if every minute of my life I’m
          not reminded of it. I’m just
          tired. I’m tired of having
          nothing I do matter, including
          having the affair --

                        ASTRID
          Of course, what you do matters.
          How can you say that?

As the driver pulls over, Astrid reacts, thrown.

Michael gets out of the car. Just like that, he’s gone.
Shell-shocked, Astrid starts to break down... then
quickly pulls herself together.


INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - DAY

The interior of the church has been transformed into an
ARTFUL ABSTRACT FOREST.

Eleanor, Jacqueline, Alix, and Felicity hold court with
other SOCIETY WIVES by the front pews. Eleanor looks at
the trees, disapproving.

                        ELEANOR
          Is this a church or a paddy field?

                        ALIX
          They spent 40 million on the
          wedding.

                       FELICITY
          Really? That’s too much, we’re
          Methodists. 20 million is our
          limit.

                        ALIX
          I know.

                        JACQUELINE
          Princess Intan!

They turn to see PRINCESS INTAN, 40s, a lofty Southeast
Asian royal, and her entourage passing by. The Aunties
smile but Princess Intan ignores them.

                        JACQUELINE
          Vicious woman. I heard she
          demanded a whole row to herself,
          so she wouldn't be bothered by
          anyone.

Oliver is in the b.g. greeting one of the female guests.

                        OLIVER
          Lovely as always. You made it!

All the Aunties turn to see Rachel, walking down the
aisle. She’s confident, luminous, turning heads as she
walks by. The Aunties look stunned as Rachel reaches
their pew.

                         RACHEL
          Aunties.

                        ELEANOR
          Rachel, how lovely to see you.

                        RACHEL
          The pleasure is all mine.

                        ELEANOR
          I'm sorry our row is full.

Rachel smiles, placid.

               (chuckles)
          Bak-bak. Okay.

Rachel looks for an empty seat, sees one by Princess
Intan, and heads over.

Jacqueline and Eleanor see this and exchange glances,
looking forward to seeing Rachel being taken down a peg.

Rachel approaches the Princess.

                        RACHEL
          Princess Intan? Rachel Chu.

watching, incredulous.

                        PRINCESS INTAN (O.S.)
          I received so much criticism about
          that article.

                        RACHEL
          Well, you know what? I think your
          critics missed the point. 'Cause
          your microloans helped women, and
          women lift up economies.

The Princess is surprised.   The Princess looks at Rachel,
reassessing her.

                        PRINCESS INTAN
          What is your name again?

                          RACHEL
          Rachel Chu.

                        PRINCESS INTAN
          It's a pleasure to meet you.   Now,
          what brings you here.

All the Aunties look disappointed that Rachel has been
accepted by the Princess.

                        RACHEL
          I followed a boy...


ANOTHER ANGLE

AN EXCITED BUZZ ripples through the crowd. Heads turn to
see Astrid, statuesque, gorgeous, enter with AH MA, in a
beautiful stately gown, her two Thai servants following
behind. Eleanor and the Aunties react, surprised.

          Yeah, I don’t blame her. Mother

          welcoming. But I’m sure she’ll be
          at the back somewhere laying low.

with the PASTOR. They’re a dashing pack.

Rachel looks at Nick, her heart swelling with pride.
Nick finds her gaze, they lock eyes.

When a HUSH falls over the crowd.    Eyes turn to:

KINA GRANNIS, who takes the stage. She starts singing a
hauntingly beautiful rendition of “I Can’t Help Falling
In Love.”

The MUSIC SOARS as we go into a --


STYLISTIC MONTAGE

-- TWO ADORABLE FLOWER GIRLS (6) enter, scattering
petals.

-- An equally adorable RING BEARER boy (5) toddles in,
clutching his ring pillow.

-- The congregation, Nick, and Rachel react to the
adorable kids.

-- Alistair and Kitty are in the audience smooching.

-- As the children reach the altar, Nick takes the
ring/pillow from the little boy and does a high-five with
him.

-- As KINA sings with two 12-YEAR-OLD CHINESE VIOLINISTS
AND A BASS PLAYER accompanying her:

                        KINA
          Like a river flows...

-- the AISLE OPENS UP and WATER FLOWS DOWN IT.

-- The congregations gasps, amazed. Rachel and Nick
stare at each other lovingly. THE MUSIC STOPS. The
LIGHTS DIM, everyone in the audience are holding delicate
lights on long stems. They all stand and look to the
back:

-- Where a group of BRIDESMAIDS hold large fronds,
forming a SCREEN. They part, REVEALING:

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                      114.
CONTINUED:

-- Araminta, who’s luminous, a wedding fantasy come to
life. She stands next to her father, holds his arm.

-- Araminta steps out of her shoes. The MUSIC swells
back up as she steps onto the watery aisle.

-- Araminta walks down the aisle with her bridesmaids
following, as the audience all wave the GLITTERY LIGHTS
towards her.

-- Nick looks to Rachel, mouths, “I love you.” Rachel
catches her breath, mouths back, “I love you, too,” tears
rolling down her cheeks.

-- Araminta and Colin face each other as the pastor
officiates. Amid all the pageantry, it’s still just a
man and a woman, about to be joined together for life.

-- All eyes are on Colin and Araminta... except for
Eleanor, who watches Nick and Rachel with growing
concern.

-- Colin lifts Araminta’s veil, they kiss, and everyone
claps and cheers.

                                             TRANSITION TO:


EXT. GARDENS BY THE BAY - NIGHT

The botanical gardens have been transformed into a
magical reception site. The supertrees tower overhead as
a CHINESE BIG BAND plays. Fireworks POP, POP, POP
overhead.

Colin and Araminta are having their first dance, loosely
circled by their wedding party, including Nick and
Rachel, who are doing everything they can to keep their
hands off each other. As they watch Colin and Araminta:

                        NICK
          You look spectacular, you know
          that?

                        RACHEL
          It's the double Spanx.   I can't
          breathe.

                        NICK
          It’s not the clothes.    It’s
          just... you.

Rachel smiles. Nick leans in to kiss her when Araminta
calls to the group:

                        ARAMINTA
          Uh, excuse me. This party isn't
          gonna dance itself. Come on.

                        COLIN
          Come on, Nicki-Nick.

                          NICK
          All right.

                          ARAMINTA
          Yeah!   Whoo!

                        NICK
          Okay. You're very good.

                       COLIN
          Yeah? I only stepped on her
          twice.

                          NICK
          Very good.

                        OLIVER
               (to Felicity)
          I mean, obviously...

                          FELICITY
          Yeah.

                          ALISTAIR
          Yeah!   Whoo!


IN ANOTHER AREA
-- Eleanor sees Nick and Rachel dancing. She hears a
SQUEAL and turns to see KITTY PONG twerking on Alistair,
who has a silly grin on his face. Eleanor reacts with
distaste. She’s in no mood for this.

Eleanor turns to Oliver, gestures to Kitty and Alistair.

                          ELEANOR
          Oliver.

                          OLIVER
          Yes, Aunty?

                        ELEANOR
          Be a dear and take care of that.

                          OLIVER
          As you wish.

                                              (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Eleanor leaves. Oliver doesn’t love being ordered about,
but does as he’s told.


ANOTHER ANGLE

We FIND Nick and Rachel on the dance floor, completely
into each other and having fun.

                        RACHEL
          You know, you should wear a tux
          more often.

                        NICK
          Like all the time?

                        RACHEL
          Hmm, yeah. You know, when you're
          playing basketball at the Y,
          shaving, brushing your teeth --

He pulls her in, close.   She looks into his eyes... and
they kiss.


ON KITTY AND ALISTAIR

as Oliver walks up.

                        OLIVER
          Alistair, your father’s looking
          for you. Something about an
          overdrawn discretionary account.

Alistair’s face falls and he takes off. Oliver holds his
hand out to Kitty, who takes it. As Oliver leads her in
a dance, handling her expertly:

                          ALISTAIR
          Oh, my God.

                         KITTY
          Baby!   Oh, my gosh!     Ah!   Hey.

                          OLIVER
          So...

                          KITTY
          Hmm?

                        OLIVER
          How do you like the wedding?

                                                    117.

                        KITTY
          Oh, my gosh! It's so glamorous!
          When it's Alistair's and my
          wedding, I want it just like this.

                          OLIVER
          Hmm.

                          KITTY
          No, no!    I want it big!   Big!
          Better!

                        OLIVER
               (laughs)
          Sweetie! You’ll be lucky if
          Alistair’s parents give you a tea
          ceremony.

                          KITTY
          Ooh --

Kitty looks at Oliver, confused.

                        OLIVER
          You know, Alistair's only the
          fourth son of a penny-pinching
          family, don't you? I mean, he'll
          get next to nothing. You want a
          wedding like this? You should've
          fallen in love with an only child.
          Someone like... Bernard Tai.

Oliver twirls her around and dips her to see Bernard
surrounded by women and drinking from a champagne bottle.

ON NICK AND RACHEL

Nick and Rachel pull apart to see one of Ah Ma’s THAI
SERVANTS. She speaks with a gentle Thai accent:

                        THAI SERVANT
          Master Nicholas... your
          grandmother would like to speak to
          you and Miss Rachel.

                          RACHEL
          Okay.

                          NICK
          Come on.

                                                    118.


ON BERNARD AND GIRLS

                            BERNARD
          Sick party.

                            GIRL
          Yeah!

As Kitty approaches Bernard to dance with him, he hands a
champagne bottle to a girl.

                            BERNARD
          Hold that.


EXT. PRIVATE ALCOVE - NIGHT

The Thai Servant takes Rachel and Nick to a private area
where Ah Ma and Eleanor are seated at a table.

                            NICK
          Ah Ma.     Mum.   What's all this
          about?

Ah Ma turns to Rachel.

                        AH MA
               (in Mandarin;
                subtitled)
          Rachel... suiran wo renshi ni de
          rizi bu chang, ke wo kan de
          chulai, ni shi ge congming ren.
          [Rachel. I’ve only known you a
          short time, but it’s clear you’re
          a very smart woman.]
Nick smiles at Ah Ma’s seeming endorsement of Rachel.

                        AH MA
               (in Mandarin;
                subtitled)
          Ke wo buneng rang ni hui le wo de
          sunzi gen wo de jia. [But, I will
          not permit you to ruin my grandson
          with your ambition.]

Rachel is stunned.    Nick, reacts, shocked.

                            NICK
          Ah Ma!

                        ELEANOR
          I’m sorry to tell you, but Rachel
          has been lying to us about her
          family and her mother...
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                       119.

                        RACHEL
               (guard up)
          What, uh... What are you talking
          about?

                        ELEANOR
          I hired a private investigator to
          look into her past --

                        NICK
          Mum, you didn’t --

                        ELEANOR
          She said her father passed away in
          China, but that’s not true.
               (to Rachel)
          Your mother’s husband is very much
          alive. During her marriage she
          cheated on him and became pregnant
          with another man’s child, and
          before he found out she ran away
          to America.

Rachel is gutted, doesn’t know what to think.

Eleanor opens a DOSSIER on the table. Chinese news
articles and police missing person reports featuring
Kerry’s picture.

                        ELEANOR
          It’s all in here.

                        NICK
          You had no right --

                        ELEANOR
          We had every right.

                        RACHEL
          Stop -- You’re lying.

                         NICK
          You did not!

                        ELEANOR
          Do you have any idea the scandal
          this would have caused? For Rachel
          to hide something like this --

                        NICK
          She wouldn’t have.

Eleanor sees Rachel is clearly shocked.


                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                      120.

                        ELEANOR
          We cannot be linked to this sort
          of family.

Rachel looks at Eleanor, backs away, reeling.

                        RACHEL
          I don’t want any part of your
          family.

He reaches for her, but Rachel pulls away, stung.

                           NICK
          Rachel --

Rachel takes off, Nick starts after her, when:

                        AH MA
               (in Mandarin;
                subtitled)

          her and degrade yourself. I
          forbid it. If you go with her,
          you can’t come back!]

                         NICK
          Let me go!   Rachel.

Nick pulls away and runs after Rachel.

                           ELEANOR
          Ah Ma!   Nick!

                        AH MA
               (in Mandarin;

          fault. You let this happen by
          allowing him to stay away so long.
          Now, look!]

Eleanor stands there, submissive. Ah Ma reacts, stunned,
furious. OFF Eleanor, her worst fears coming true...


EXT. GARDENS BY THE BAY - CANAL - NIGHT

Rachel is upset, disoriented, as she makes her way
through the crowd.

          midnight?

                         ARAMINTA
          Why?   It's all non-fat.

                         FEMALE WEDDING GUEST #2
          Drink girl!   Drink!

She hears a SCREAM and turns to see several guests
POINTING and LAUGHING at:

A HALF-NAKED Bernard and Kitty behind some bushes.
Bernard is completely drunk and paws at Kitty, who’s
mortified at being discovered.

The crowd LAUGHS, derisive, as Kitty struggles to pull
her dress up as she flees.

It’s sickening to Rachel -- it feels like people are
talking about her as much as Kitty. She flees...
Among the crowd, we FIND Nick searching for Rachel, but
he’s too late...

                         NICK
          Oliver.

          It's good to see you.   Let's talk.
          For old times' sake.

Nick frantically looks around the party for Rachel.    TIME
LAPSE as the crowd clears and it starts to rain.


EXT. GOH HOUSE - NIGHT

A PAIR OF BARE FEET walks up to the gate.

RACHEL, her once-flawless hair, makeup, and dress are a
mess. She carries her HIGH HEELS IN HER HANDS. Peik Lin
rushes to Rachel, who bursts into tears and collapses
into her friend.


INT. GOH HOUSE - PEIK LIN’S ROOM - DAY

Rachel lies on the upholstered bench at the end of the
bed, unmoving, staring into space. Sparse sunlight
filters into the room. Peik Lin enters.

                        PEIK LIN
          Rachel? Come to breakfast. You
          need to eat. Or, use the
          bathroom, or maybe a shower. It's
          there if you need it.

But Rachel doesn’t move.


TIME LAPSE SEQUENCE

-- It’s NIGHT: Rachel still lies in bed, awake, but not
moving. The door opens. It’s Neenah and Wye Mun with a
dinner tray. They have the twin girls bring the tray to
Rachel.

                        WYE MUN
               (whispering)
          Here, take this tray, okay. Take

          Thank you.

The girls run back to Neenah and Wye Mun and they all
leave Rachel who’s just staring at the dinner tray.

-- Darkness gives way to dawn, but Rachel is still in
bed, unmoving. On the bedside table, her PHONE RINGS.
It’s NICK, Rachel presses ignore and places the phone
face-down on the table. Nick leaves a message --

                        NICK (V.O.)

          Rachel, please, just give me a
          call. Anytime. Please.

Nick hangs up.


INT. GOH FAMILY HOUSE - PEIK LIN’S ROOM - DAY

Peik Lin enters the dark room.

                        PEIK LIN
          Rachel, someone’s here to see ya.

Rachel doesn’t move.

                        RACHEL
          I don’t want to see him.

                           PEIK LIN
          It’s not Nick.

Someone steps in from behind Peik Lin.   It’s KERRY.
Rachel stirs, can’t believe her eyes.

                           RACHEL
          Mom!




                                                (CONTINUED)

Rachel rushes to her mom, hugging her. Rachel tears up,
finally with the person she needed the most.

                                                TIME CUT TO:


INT. GOH FAMILY HOUSE - PEIK LIN’S ROOM - DAY

The blinds are open and Rachel sits up, looking better,
as Kerry fusses over her, bringing her herbal soup.

                        KERRY
          Drink more. The dong-quai and the
          ginseng will give you more energy.

                        RACHEL
          Thanks.

Rachel lets herself be mothered, but Kerry sees the toll
the last few days have taken.

                        KERRY
          Your spirit has always been so
          strong, ever since young. You
          will get through this.

Rachel nods, needing to hear that.   But:

                        RACHEL
          Why didn’t you tell me about my
          father?

Kerry nods, she’s been expecting this.

                        KERRY
          My husband wasn’t a good man. He
          hurt me.
               (off Rachel)
          But an old schoolmate of mine
          helped me through things and we
          fell in love and I got pregnant
          with his baby, that’s you. I was
          so afraid my husband would find
          out and kill us both, so I just
          took you and I ran to America.

Rachel is stunned.

                        RACHEL
          Did you ever...? I don't know,
          think about trying to talk to him?
          I mean, do you think about him?



                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                      125.
CONTINUED:

                        KERRY
          Every day. When we first came to
          America all I could think about
          was reaching out for him, but I
          was so afraid my husband would
          find us. And now, I, I just don't
          want to cause any trouble.

                        RACHEL
          I’m really sorry.

Kerry shakes her head, smiles through the tears.

                        KERRY
          Oh! Don’t be sorry. You listen
          to me, everything that happened in
          my past life is the reason why I
          got you.

Rachel tears up, vulnerable.

                        KERRY
          My brave and clever girl.

Rachel flops back on the bed.    Her mother lies down next
to her.

                        RACHEL
          I really thought he was the one.

OFF Rachel as this sinks in.

                        RACHEL
          Now, I just wanna go home.

                        KERRY
          You know, Nick was the one who
          called me and brought me out here.
          Before we go, I think you should
          go and talk to him.

Rachel sighs. Then they hear a clicking sound and turn
to see P.T. at the doorway holding his phone and taking
photos of them.

                        P.T.
          I'll e-mail the photo later.

                        RACHEL
          P.T., how long you been standing
          there?

                        P.T.
          Just a short while.

                                                (CONTINUED)

Rachel and Kerry laugh.


EXT. RIVERFRONT - DAY

Rachel sits on a bench, when she sees Nick approach,
tentative, hopeful. He sits next to her.

                        NICK
          I’m so sorry about everything.
          What my mother did to you is
          unforgivable --

                        RACHEL
          It’s not your fault --

                        NICK
          It is. Ever since I can remember,
          my family has been my whole life.
          And I am done making excuses for
          them.

He pulls out the ring he’s been carrying.   Rachel looks
at Nick, astounded.

                          RACHEL
          Nick --

                        NICK
          Marry me. Marry me and we’ll
          start our new life together in New
          York, just you and me. I’ll leave
          all of this behind.


EXT. STREET - DAY
Eleanor, wearing sunglasses, walks by the row of old
terraced shophouses, pausing when she hears a familiar
CLACKING sound. She walks through an unmarked door,
into:


INT. MAHJONG HALL - DAY

Eleanor enters to see Rachel playing mahjong with two
WOMEN at a back table.

It’s a FLUID, RHYTHMIC RITUAL -- the staccato clacking of
tiles, stacks being formed and moved like clockwork.
Eleanor is surprised to see how adept and effortless
Rachel is. Eleanor walks up to the table.



                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                     127.
CONTINUED:

                        RACHEL
          Thanks for meeting me here.
               (re: women)
          Don’t worry about them. They’re
          half deaf and they only speak
          Hokkien.

                        WOMAN
               (hands Eleanor dice)
          Mm-hmm.

Eleanor sits down at the table, and tosses the dice in
the middle of the stacks of tiles. She starts playing
the game.

                        RACHEL
          My mom taught me how to play. She
          told me mahjong would teach me
          important life skills.
          Negotiation, strategy,
          cooperation.

(NOTE: The game goes on throughout the scene. With
cards thrown, picked up, chips exchanging hands, etc.)

                        ELEANOR
          You asked me here. I assume it’s
          not for a mahjong lesson. Pung.

She puts down a power card combo.   The women toss red
chips to her.

                        ELEANOR
          My mother taught me, too.

Rachel tosses her a red chip.
                        RACHEL
          I know Nick told you the truth
          about my mom. But you didn’t like
          me the second I got here. Why is
          that?

                        ELEANOR
          There’s a Hokkien phrase. Ka gi
          lan. It means ‘our own kind of
          people.’ And you’re not our own
          kind.

                        RACHEL
          ‘Cause I’m not rich? ‘Cause I
          didn’t go to a British boarding
          school or I wasn't born into a
          wealthy family?

                        ELEANOR
          You’re a foreigner. American.
          And all Americans think about is
          their own happiness.

                        RACHEL
          Don’t you want Nick to be happy?

                        ELEANOR
          It’s an illusion. We understand
          how to build things that last.
          Something you know nothing about.

                        RACHEL
          You don’t know me.

                        ELEANOR
          I know you’re not what Nick needs.

                        RACHEL
          Well, he proposed to me yesterday.
               (off Eleanor)
          He said he’d walk away from his
          family and from you, for good.

Eleanor’s hand slips, she drops a tile.   The other women
exchange looks, sensing the tension:

                        RACHEL
          Don’t worry, I turned him down.

Eleanor tries to regain her composure.

                        ELEANOR
          Only a fool folds a winning hand.
                         RACHEL
          There’s no winning. You made sure
          of that. Because if Nick chose
          me, he would lose his family. And
          if he chose his family, he might
          spend the rest of his life
          resenting you.

Eleanor grabs a tile that Rachel had just discarded.

                        ELEANOR
               (realizing)
          So you chose for him.

                        RACHEL
          I’m not leaving ‘cause I’m scared
          or because I think I’m not enough.
          Because... maybe for the first
          time in my life, I know I am.

               (beat)
          I just love Nick so much. I don't
          want him to lose his mom again.
          So I just wanted you to know that
          one day, when he marries another
          lucky girl, who is enough for you,
          and you're playing with your
          grandkids while the tan huas are
          blooming, and the birds are
          chirping, that it was because of
          me... a poor, raised by a single
          mother, low class, immigrant
          nobody.

Rachel SHOWS HER HAND -- a WINNING COMBINATION -- but she
FOLDS. The game is mucked (no one can win). Rachel gets
up.

As Rachel reaches the door, REVEAL Kerry has been sitting
quietly at another table. As Kerry joins Rachel, she
turns to see Eleanor and the two mothers exchange a look.


INT. ASTRID’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

Astrid enters as Michael packs a bag. Michael is
uncomfortable, not wanting to do this in front of her.

                        MICHAEL
          Hey. I'm gonna send someone for
          the rest of my stuff. But I wanna
          talk to you about my visitation
          rights with Cassian.

                          ASTRID
          Stop talking.
                          MICHAEL
          What?

                        ASTRID
          Don’t worry about packing your
          things. You bought this
          apartment, you keep it. We’re
          leaving --

                        MICHAEL
          What do you mean, you're leaving?
          Where are you gonna go?

                        ASTRID
          I have fourteen apartment
          buildings that I own, so probably
          one of those.

          good for him, not when it’s good
          for you.

Astrid walks away.   Michael takes her arm, holds her
back.

                        MICHAEL
          Hey! Look, you know, it's not
          just my fault that things didn't
          work out.

Astrid pauses, then:

                        ASTRID
          You’re right. I shouldn’t have
          kept things from you. Hidden my
          shoes, turned down jobs, charity
          work, worrying that it might make
          you feel lesser than. But let’s
          be clear -- the problem with our
          marriage isn’t my family’s money.
          It’s that you’re a coward. You
          gave up on us. But I’ve just
          realized --
               (then)
          It’s not my job to make you feel
          like a man. I can’t make you
          something you’re not.

          Good for you. Walking away from
          Nick and his family's fat-ass
          property portfolio. You have no

          planned out.
                (to sitting man on
                 plane)
          Oh, yeah, right behind you. Don't
          mind me.
                (to Rachel)
          I'd bring you to my favorite spot
          on the island. There's a hidden
          trail that I used to go to as a
          child. Now there's a cove there
          that opens up to this beautiful
          lake.
                (to standing man on
                 plane)
          Um, sorry, dude. Give me a
          second. Let me just move.

Nick passes by the standing man as he continues:

                        NICK
          When the sun hits the horizon, I'd
          get down on one knee.

Rachel sighs.
                        NICK
          And the rest of the world would
          fall away. Because it would just
          be you and -- Because it's just
          you and --
               (to female passenger
                struggling with
                carry-on)
          Sorry, I can help you with that.
          That's fine.
               (to Rachel)
          Stay there.

Thump. Now, Nick is JOSTLED by a WOMAN trying to jam her
carry-on in the overhead compartment.



                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                       134.
CONTINUED:

                        NICK
               (to woman on plane)
          Yay. You, too? Watch your
          fingers. Lift it up. Okay.

Nick steps into the aisle, helps the Woman and others get
their luggage put away.

                        NICK
               (to surrounding
                passengers)
          Everybody okay? Because I just
          need thirty seconds with this
          woman. Okay, thank you.

Nick turns back to Rachel... and gets down on one knee.
Rachel is astounded, tries to stay strong.

                        NICK
          Oh, coming through. Sorry. I
          know this is a far throw from a
          hidden paradise...

Rachel looks into his eyes.

                        NICK
          But wherever you are in the world,
          that’s where I belong.

She takes this in.    He pulls out a ring box.

                          RACHEL
          But, I --

Nick opens the box, revealing:     ELEANOR’S EMERALD RING.
Time stops. Rachel’s breath parts from her for the
moment. Her eyes meet his and then --

                        NICK
          Rachel Chu. Will you marry me and
          make me the happiest man in this
          world?

Rachel, teary-eyed and overwhelmed, is about to respond.

                          CHUBBY WOMAN
          Yes!   Yes!   Yes! She will marry
          you!

Nick looks at Rachel, “Is Chubby Woman right?” Rachel
hands her neck pillow to Chubby woman. Kerry is standing
behind her, all smiles.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                       135.
CONTINUED:

                        RACHEL
          Yes!!

The cabin ERUPTS in HOOTS and CLAPPING! Nick puts the
ring on her finger -- a perfect fit. He pulls her into
his arms as he kisses her.

Chubby Woman high-fives Kerry.

Rachel grins as she’s inches away from Nick.

                        NICK
          I love you.

                        RACHEL
          I love you, too. This is gonna be
          some flight back to New York.

                        NICK
          Well, I was actually thinking
          about staying one more night

OFF Rachel, intrigued, in love, excited.   She kisses him
again.


EXT. MARINA BAY SANDS (SINGAPORE) - SKY DECK - NIGHT

Nick leads Rachel into the middle of a crowd of people
with his hands covering her eyes.

When he removes his hands, she sees a crowd of Nick’s
friends screaming and cheering. Araminta and Colin in
front leading the pack.

It’s an ENGAGEMENT PARTY at this mind-blowing location,
perched high above the city.

Everyone has shown up: Peik Lin, Eddie, Fiona, Alistair,
Bernard, Kitty, Oliver, Colin, Araminta, Charlie, and THE
GOHs. They all cheer and hug Rachel and Nick.

Nick points for Rachel to look at the pool where
SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMERS are performing.

Rachel spots Eleanor in the distance. There’s a look of
understanding, respect between them. Nick kisses Rachel
as all the revelers clap and scream their
congratulations. We PULL AWAY as fireworks explode in
the b.g...

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

                                                       136.

Crazy, Stupid, Love
      By Dan Fogelman




         Page 1/58

Oh, come on
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little
Save a little for me
Oh, I'm so full.
You were right,
I shouldn't have eaten all that bread.
Want to split a dessert?
You okay? You seem a little off.
Yeah, I'm just trying to think about
what I want.
Yeah, me too.
Why don't we just say it at the same time?
One, two, three...
- I want a divorce.
- Crme brle.
- You can't get away.
- Aah!
It's okay, that's my fault.
Come on, let's get you to bed
before your parents get home.
No puppy eyes, you little maniac.
Go brush your teeth.
Aren't you gonna say anything?
Almost 25 years of marriage
and you have nothing to say?
Robbie.
Hey, Robbie, have you seen
Molly's homework?
- Get out.
- Oh, my God.
- Close the door.
- Um...
Okay, Robbie, I'm really sorry,
and I didn't see anything.
Oh, my God.
You're not talking, and you know
that only makes me talk more.
But maybe that's good, you know?
Because maybe I'll just say it.
Maybe... Maybe I'll just tell you
I slept with someone.


                                 Page 2/58

David Lindhagen. From work.
- You met him at the Christmas party.
- Please stop.
The last person in the world
I'd wanna hurt is you.
If you keep talking, I'm gonna get out.
I think the fact that I did it,
it just shows how broken we are.
- Okay.
- How much we really... Cal.
Oh, my God! Cal!
Are you okay?
I'll leave tonight. I'll sign whatever you want.
Just please stop talking about it.
Okay.
I'm sorry you had to see that.
No, you know, I should have knocked.
Just for the record,
I think about you while I do it.
- Robbie.
- I have this picture of you...
...and I look at it the whole time.
- Stop it.
I love you, Jessica.
I am actually begging you to stop it.
And I know you're 17,
and I know I just turned 13...
...which is the same age
as your little brother.
But soon our age difference
won't even matter.
Which is good, because I'm pretty sure
you're my soul mate.
Okay, um...
- Listen, Robbie...
- We're home.
- Shit.
- Hey.
Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Weaver, how was...?
Oh, my God. Uh, what happened?
Mrs. Weaver said she wanted a divorce,
and I jumped out of the car.
- Cal. Honey...
- Well...


                                 Page 3/58

- Kids good? Everybody good?
- Dad?
- Oh.
- Oh. Hey, I didn't see you standing there.
- You're getting a divorce?
- Well, yes.
Uh, so, Jess,
did Molly get through dinner okay?
Yeah, yeah, she's...
- You jumped out of a moving car?
- I jumped out of a moving car.
- Did she fight you on broccoli?
- No, she didn't.
She always fights me.
- Sorry you had to find out this way.
- Sorry you jumped out of a car.
- I'm sorry if she fought you.
- It's okay.
I don't have any money.
Uh, sweetheart? Let's go to bed, okay?
Listen, why don't you grab your coat?
I'll drive you home. All right.
I don't care. I love him. I really do.
And, given the opportunity...
Yes, I would have his babies.
Seriously? Conan O'Brien?
You would do Conan O'Brien?
Oh, my God, yes.
Ew. Friend to friend, ew.
I don't know. Your life is so PG-13.
- My life is not PG-13.
- Oh, it so is.
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.
You've never left L.A. You pass the bar,
you're gonna be what, a patent lawyer?
Probably married to that human Valium,
Richard. I just...
Listen, I worry about you, is all.
So much potential...
...and you've resorted to fantasizing
about Conan ""Ginger Junk"" O'Brien.
- He's funny.
- He looks like a carrot, honey.


                                 Page 4/58

Who looks like a carrot?
Hi. Who looks like a carrot?
Conan O'Brien.
My friend Hannah here
thinks he's sexy.
That's weird, I think that your friend
Hannah is sexy.
Oh, my God. You did not just say that.
How old are you?
- What are you, a lawyer?
- Yeah. A little bit.
- Come on.
- I know.
- You are? Is she?
- Gonna be.
Don't you think you're a little old
to use cheesy pickup lines?
- Objection. Leading the witness.
- Ha, ha.
You're wearing that
like you're doing it a favor.
- Oh, God.
- That's a line.
Me sitting there for the past two hours not
being able to take my eyes off you is fact.
I mean, there's lots of beautiful women
in this bar. Your friend included. Hi.
I love you.
But I can't take my eyes off of you.
That's a fact, it's not a line.
I find you very attractive.
Do you find me attractive?
- She does.
- I don't.
- Tsk. You do. She does.
- Yes, she does.
- I don't.
- You do.
- You do.
- I don't.
- Hannah, can I buy you a drink?
- No.
- You say no a lot, don't you?
- No.


                                 Page 5/58

Oh, boy. Permission
to approach the bench?
Seriously?
Just, come on, let me deliver
my closing argument.
Sure. Proceed.
- Hannah, we live in a physical world, right?
- Uh-huh.
- And you're going to age, right?
- Mm-hm.
You're never gonna regret going home
with that guy from the bar that one time...
...that was a total tomcat in the sack.
But I can't guarantee
that you won't not regret it.
- That was a double negative.
- You're a double negative.
Okay. Hannah, can I buy you a drink?
Okay. You know what?
It's time to go home.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
That's forward of you, but okay.
I'll do it.
I TiVoed Saw III.
So should I get my car or yours?
Should I pull the car around?
You been drinking? I'll drive.
- Liz?
- Coming.
- I'll have to call Nanna.
- Huh?
Oh. Noth...
So Stanford, huh?
Good for you. That's great.
I know your dad's really proud.
Yeah. Yeah, he's...
- Are you sure you're okay?
- David Lindhagen, God.
Okay.
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.
It's okay.
Um...
- Mr. Weaver?


                                 Page 6/58

- Hmm?
Um...
You're the nicest dad that I babysit...
Of all the, um...
You're really nice.
- That's very nice.
- And, um...
...I like Ms. Weaver,
I like her a lot. Okay?
But if she wants to divorce you...
...then I think she's batshit crazy.
Mm.
- Sorry.
- Okay. Okay.
I hope this doesn't make you
uncomfortable.
- I've developed, like, a little crush...
- Could you do me a favor?
Would you not mention to your parents
that Mrs. Weaver and I are, you know...
It's something we wanna tell them
on our own, okay?
Yeah.
Thank you, I appreciate that.
Have a good night.
See you soon
Another vodka cranberry?
I'm sorry. What?
- Another vodka cranberry?
- Oh, yeah. Yes, thanks.
It's no surprise
I've been by this place
a million times, never come in.
It's nice, lot of pretty girls.
Nowhere
This is my life
- Hey, guess what.
- What?
My wife is having intercourse
with someone who is not me.
Um, I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh. Thank you. That is very nice
of you to say. Very, very nice.
She just told me. I just found out,


                                 Page 7/58

so I'm a little raw. It's...
Ah, okay. Well, you're not listening.
Okay.
You wouldn't ignore me
if I were David Lindhagen.
My wife doesn't ignore David Lindhagen.
She screws him.
Screws him.
They make this, like, gurgling sound,

it's like:
Gay.
- Hey, Cal.
- Hey.
Hey.
Oh, I just, uh... I got the report
on the end-of-year financials.
- Good. Good, good. Really great.
- Oh, good.
You killed this quarter.
Okay.
- Cal, seriously.
- All right.
- Okay.
- Seriously.
Who told you
that Emily and I are getting divorced?
- You're getting a divorce?
- Yeah.
Amy heard you crying in the bathroom.
We all thought it was cancer.
- Oh.
- Thank God, man. Ha-ha-ha.
Yeah, just my relationship.
- Thank God.
- Oh...
Divorce.
- I'm so lucky.
- You are.
- I have to go pick out furniture now.
- Okay, okay. You go for it.
It could have been cancer, buddy.
Hey, everyone, it's just a divorce.
All right, buddy.


                                 Page 8/58

Thanks. Feels good.
Cal? I just wanted to say...
Shit.
Can I back that thing
out of the driveway for you?
- Oh, no. I'll be fine.
- You have trouble in reverse, is all.
When I get settled, the kids can come
and take a look at my new place.
I think I'm having a midlife crisis,
maybe.
Can women have midlife crises?
In the movies it's always men having them
and buying ridiculous yellow Porsches...
...but, you know, I'm not a man.
Be sure to fertilize all this.
We got married so young, Cal.
And now I'm 44.
And it's so much older
than I thought I'd be.
There's a turnoff valve
for the sprinklers over there.
Last week, when I told you
that I had to work late...
...I went to see the new Twilight movie
by myself.
I don't know why I did that.
And it was so bad, Cal.
It keeps raining, you might
wanna turn off the automatic setting.
And we haven't been us.
Not for a long time.
And I don't know when you and I
stopped being us.
I mean, do you?
Maybe it's when
you screwed David Lindhagen.
Nobody wants to be alone
The heart beats happy
when it has a place
And if it doesn't have a home
It can come into my space
So you can be the one I love
I can be the one you long for


                                 Page 9/58

You can be the one I want
Hey.
Sorry I'm late,
I had to pick something up at Macy's.
- Oh. Don't even worry about it.
- A chardonnay.
I'm just glad you're here.
Wow.
I don't know. I don't know what happened.
Tough couple of days.
You know
when you don't see something coming...
Claire said I can't be friends
with you anymore.
What?
She said we had to choose
between you and Emily.
I chose you.
But she said no.
It's cologne.
Bernie?
- Are you breaking up with me, Bernie?
- There's a gift receipt in there also.
Bernie?
Bernie. Bernie.
I can be the one you long for
You can be the one
You know a word
that is not used very often anymore?
""Cuckold.""
I'm a cuckold.
David Lindhagen cuckolded me.
He made a cuckold out of me.
He slept with my wife.
And I didn't know about it.
And that is the definition of cuckoldom.
David Lindhagen took my wife
and slept with her.
Thought I did everything right.
Got married, had kids, the house.
What do I get for it? I get cuckolded.
David Lindhagen cuckolded me.
He made a cuckold out of me.
Welcome to my spaceship


                                 Page 10/58

It's beautiful forever
Can you give me five minutes?
The heart's a lonely hunter
Interesting.
Hey. Jacob Palmer.
- Cal Weaver.
- Let me buy you a drink, Cal.
- Thanks, I have a drink.
- Sit. I'd like to buy you a drink.
Okay.
Guess what.
- My wife is having an affair with...
- David Lindhagen.
David Lindhagen. I know.
- How do I know that?
- I don't know.
I'm a total stranger. How would I know
something so intimate?
- Lindhagen screwing with your wife too?
- No.
- Hmm.
- You wanna know why I know that?
Okay.
It's all that I've heard, Cal, for the past
two nights. It's all anybody's heard.
You're going around and you're badgering
people with this sad-sack loser sob story.
- I don't understand why.
- I don't need this crap.
- Cal, sit down.
- All right.
Look, I know that it sounds harsh,
but it's true.
And you need to hear the truth. Okay?
Okay.
Cal, would you take that straw
out of your mouth? Please.
That looks like
you're sucking on a tiny schwantz.
Is that what you want?
Is that the message you wanna send?
- No one's thinking that.
- Really?
- So permission to speak candidly, sir.


                                 Page 11/58

- Uh, think you've already gone there.
You're sitting there
with a Supercuts haircut...
...getting drunk on watered-down vodka
cranberries like a 14-year-old girl...
...and you're wearing a 44
when you should be wearing a 42 regular.
Honestly, I don't know if I should
help you or euthanize you.
Cal, you got a kind face.
You got a good head of hair.
You seem like a nice guy.
I wanna help you. I'm gonna help you
rediscover your manhood.
Do you have any idea,
like, where you lost it?
- A strong case could be made for 1984.
- Well.
We're gonna find it.
We are. I promise you.
And I promise you this too, Cal:
When we're done...
...this wife of yours...
...she's gonna rue the day
she ever decided to give up on you.
That's my offer.
You in or you out?
Why are you doing this?
Maybe you remind me of someone.
You in or you out?
I'm in.
Hey, fancy face, you wanna go?
Okay.
Century City Mall, food court,
After you, hon.
Good night, fancy face.
She will rue the day.
Set you guys up with some snacks
over here. TV's already on.
You okay?
Mm. Yeah. You?
Mm.
Can I tell you something?
Love sucks.


                                 Page 12/58

Yeah.
You in love, buddy?
- Well, if you must know...
- Ding-dong.
- Oh, hey, Jess. Thanks for coming by.
- Hey. Yeah.
What is she doing here?
Guys, I have to step out for a couple
of minutes. Okay? All right? Okay.
Mom wants you to stay
while she's out hooking.
- What?
- What?
Oh. Um, the place is nice, Mr. Weaver.
Thanks.
That's a very generous adjective.
- Honey.
- I don't need a babysitter.
She's only four years older.
You need to know that.
- She needs to know that.
- I know, I know, I know.
Man, are you growing up.
Look at him. It's unbelievable.
He's in love already.
Oh.
Molly. Say bye to Daddy.
- Wait, where are you going?
- I'm taking a class.
- That is great, Mr. Weaver.
- Thank you.
This is a difficult time for you, right?
And it's important to try new things.
Even things that you haven't
considered trying before.
Mm-hm. Yup. Molly, I'm going.
Okay. That's my princess. Bye. Thanks.
- But wait. Dad.
- Bye, guys. See you in a bit.
Hey, Tiger.
- I love you so, so much.
- Jeez, Robbie.
I love you so much. Please?
What the hell am I doing?


                                 Page 13/58

What am I doing?
Hey, uh, everybody.
Everybody. Uh, if I could...
Thank you. A little toast.
I would like to thank you all for coming
to Hannah Banana's goodbye party.
And to my...
- ... Hannah Banana.
- Ha, ha.
You go into your cave
and you study your butt off.
Because if you do, I just know
that you are gonna kick that bar's butt...
...out of here. You know?
- Yeah.
It reminds me of an old story
my law professor told me...
Oh, dear God. Cheers, everyone.
Cheers.
Hey, Liz.
Listen, when my girl here passes...
...I'm gonna have another
little celebration right here...
...and I hope you can make it,
because it's gonna be a special night.
Okay.
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?
- You heard that? ""Special night""?
- Yeah. Yeah.
You think he's gonna propose?
At the El Torito Grill? God, I hope not.
Why, do you want him to?
I don't know, he's nice.
""He's ni...""? Hannah.
He's a sweetheart. Look at him.
- He bcc'd you?
- Right, yeah.
All right. Hannah, look at you.
Look at you.
If you end up with that,
what am I gonna end up with?
- Shut up. Come on.
- That shit's depressing.


                                 Page 14/58

All right. You know what?
I have to not big-sister you. It's fine if...
Jesus, really?
No. No. Not my life. Not my life.
I'm going. Okay?
So call me if you need anything. Bye.
You're awful. Bye.
Thank you for coming.
Um...
- You're late.
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Sbarro's?
- No, thanks.
Let me ask a question.
How much you got for clothes?
Um...
- What happened to your feet?
- What do you mean?
- These are my 407 s.
- Oh, they're 407 s.
- Can I see them?
- Yeah.
- These offer a lot of support.
- Right.
Whoa. Come on.
- What, are you in a fraternity?
- Are you insane?
You could have hit somebody.
What was that?
- I'm asking a question. You in a frat?
- No.
- Are you Steve Jobs?
- What?
Hold on a second. Are you the billionaire
owner of Apple Computers?
- No.
- Oh.
Okay. Well, in that case, you got no right
to wear New Balance sneakers ever.
- Come on.
- Mm... Oh...
Okay. All right.
One of the best parts
about being a guy your age...


                                 Page 15/58

Frankly, there aren't many, so you
should really take full advantage of it.
Uh-huh.
Is that you can rebuild your entire
wardrobe with like 16 items.
Credit card.
What?
You see, the problem
is that your head has like...
Like the proportions
of a Styrofoam peanut.
The skin under your eyes is starting
to look like Hugh Hefner's ball sac.
It does.
Where are your wallets?
- I'm set for jeans.
- You're not set for jeans.
- These are fine.
- They're not fine.
- You have a mom butt.
- Why don't we just go to the Gap?
You know what? They have a s... Okay.
What are you doing?
Cal, be better than the Gap.
Be better than the Gap.
Say it.
I'm better than the Gap.
- Come on.
- God.
- Stop slapping me. Really.
- Okay.
You're beautiful.
He likes to slap me in the face.
- What are you doing later?
- Ha, ha. I don't know.
- I do.
- Do you?
- I know exactly what you're doing.
- Oh, ha, ha.
Seriously? Seriously?
- You ask her out like that?
- Yeah.
And that worked?
Yeah.


                                 Page 16/58

Feeling kind of stupid, but...
Wow.
Look at you.
Feel like I'm going skiing.
- Would you sleep with him?
- Jesus. God.
- Yeah, probably.
- Wha...?
You would?
That's... What?
What are you even saying?
You see what just happened, Cal?
Soon as you opened your mouth, Tiffany
started doubting whether she wanted to.
That's the meanest thing
anyone's ever said to me.
No. This is.
Your wife cheated on you because
you lost sight of who you are as a man...
...as a husband, and probably as a lover.
You're right, that's meaner.
Let's talk about how many women
you've been with.
- Sexually?
- Yeah, no. I mean break-dance fighting.
One.
No. Not at one time.
How many total?
Don't say it. Don't say it.
We met in high school, okay?
Oh, boy. You're kidding me.
One woman? That's great.
- Emily is beautiful.
- I guess.
She was gorgeous.
She was one of those women...
...that could be wildly sexy
and unbelievably cute all at the same time.
We had a little blip senior year...
I literally stopped listening at ""Emily.""
I think we should start approaching
women tonight.
Are you ready to go?
I miss my wife.


                                 Page 17/58

- Hi.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?
I'm great. I'm Jacob. What's your name?
- Oh. Amy Johnson.
- Amy Johnson.
- I'm Jacob Palmer. How you doing?
- Uh, great.
- Good.
- I'm Cal.
No. Not yet.
- Sorry. Amy, can I buy you a drink?
- Uh-huh.
Keep her company?
- I'd be happy to.
- Lf he gets handsy, let me know.
I wouldn't touch you
if my life depended on it.
- Uh, what was your name?
- Cal Weaver.
- Cal Weaver.
- No relation to Dennis Weaver.
- Uh... Uh...
- McCloud.
McCloud was a show in the '70s
that...
You're not talking about McCloud
again, are you?
Here we go, huh?
To all of our fallen homeys.
Well, I'm the fourth of five sisters.
- No. That's boring.
- Oh.
Not for your sisters,
but for my purposes, it's not gonna work.
- Okay.
- I have this friend.
And he thinks that you're way too pretty
to be interesting and that's hogwash.
- All right. You wanna get out of here?
- Uh, sure.
Giddyup.
Am I boring you? I'm totally boring you.


                                 Page 18/58

I'm...
How are you doing this, like...
...wildly sexy but unbelievably cute
thing that you're doing?
- Uh...
- It's weird.
- You wanna get out of here?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Cool.
So Molly, who's 6 at the time,
can't find Mr. Bobo.
We're looking all over.
It's in the kitchen.
Mr. Bobo was in the kitchen the whole time.
Wanna get out of here?
Have a good night.
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
- Let's get out of here.
- Absolutely.
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
Shit.
- You have a second?
- Hey, David. No. Because I'm swamped.
- You've been avoiding me.
- No. I haven't.
You ran in the other direction when you
saw me coming down the hall yesterday.
- You're very fast, by the way.
- I ran track in high school.
That must be it.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry
about you and Cal.
- No, you're not.
- No, I'm not.
I like you, Emily.
Do you have any idea
how much I like you?


                                 Page 19/58

Hey, David, you know,
I really have a lot to do.
I had no intention of falling
for a married woman...
...but all of a sudden we're having
lunch and I'm this accountant...
...who's waking up every morning
excited to go to work.
And that just does not happen
for accountants. Ever.
I checked with other accountants.
David, you know what?
You've been a great friend.
You noticed last month when I got
my hair trimmed and that was huge.
But look, trust me. You know...
I am saving you from disaster, because
you're asking to pre-board the Titanic.
Do you really want any part of this?
Do I really want any part of this?
- Emily? Your report's ready.
- Okay.
Okay, people. Here it is.
The Scarlet Letter
by Nathaniel Hawthorne.
A romance set in Salem in the 1600s.
It is about sin.
Forced to wear the scarlet A
to punish her adulterous behavior.
Dimmesdale's A is inflicted upon himself
in the form of a...
Mr. Weaver.
Mr. Weaver.
Are we interrupting?
You wanna talk about
The Scarlet Letter, Ms. Tafferty?
All right.
Well, the A they're both wearing...
...I think it stands for ""asshole.""
Wanna know why?
Because they fell in love...
...and love is for stupid assholes.
And this book is just about
a bunch of assholes...


                                 Page 20/58

...who fell in love, like assholes...
...then had to die, like assholes.
I'm sorry about all the ""assholes.""
You know what else might work?
A swear jar.
You know, a quarter per curse word.
Yeah, we'll definitely try that.
All right. Could help.
- Take care.
- Thanks.
- Seriously?
- Sorry.
Hey, I have to go back to the office.
You're gonna have to wait for me there.
Fine.
They're still making kids read
The Scarlet Letter, huh?
Yep.
You'd think somebody would have
written something better by now.
I guess I should take that down, huh?
I guess.
So how is he? You know.
I mean, l... Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Forget it. Just ignore me.
- Forget I ever...
- He's out a lot.
- A lot?
- Yeah.
Like...
Like ""a lot"" a lot,
or just like a little?
A lot.
Well, that's good. That's really good.
- Wanna get takeout tonight, honey?
- I mean, he's sad.
I can tell that he's sad.
Even though he looks better...
...I can still tell that he's not happy,
you know?
Yeah. Well, you know. Yeah.
I guess I'm pretty sad too.
I know.
I heard you crying the other night.


                                 Page 21/58

Didn't know what to do.
Oh, Robbie, baby, you're 13,
you're not supposed to know what to do.
I tried Googling it.
- You did not.
- Yep. I did.
- Well, what did you Google?
- I searched ""Mom crying in bed.""
What did Google say?
Just a bunch of weird videos
of moms in bed.
Ugh. Oh, God. Okay.
All right, that's enough. No more.
Do those parental controls work at all?
They work for me.
Because you're a disgusting teenager,
that's why.
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.
- Bill wants to see you before you take off.
- Oh. Uh, David, this is my son, Robbie.
Robbie, this is David.
- Um, we work together.
- How you doing, buddy?
- You all right to wait a little bit?
- Yeah.
Okay. Thanks, David.
So, Robbie, I hear
you're quite the soccer player.
So, David, I hear
you broke up my parents' marriage.
- You are David Lindhagen, right?
- Lindhagen.
- Yeah. Here's the thing, Lindhagen.
- Hagen.
Whatever.
In the end, she winds up
back with my dad.
He's a better guy than you are
in every category.
And she still loves him.
He's not gonna give up on my mom...
...like I'm not gonna stop
sending Jessica messages...


                                 Page 22/58

...that make her feel uncomfortable.
Hey. You ready to go, honey?
- Can we order Chinese for dinner tonight?
- Yeah. Sure, honey.
Hi, David. Get your stuff.
- Bye, David.
- See you.
You're not gonna be able
to feel your arms.
I'll be fine.
Jesus Christ.
Look, let's face it, Cal, all right?
The war between the sexes is over,
and we won, okay?
We won the second women started doing
pole dancing for exercise.
But even though we won,
they still deserve our respect.
Make them feel beautiful, listen to
their problems, open the door for them.
Would you put on some clothes, please?
- I'm sorry, is this bothering you?
- No, it's not.
My schwantz is in your face.
If it's not bothering you, we got a problem.
- Okay, it bothers me.
- I don't care.
You gotta take control
of your manhood, pal. You know?
You want something, you take it.
You don't like something, you say it.
I take what I want.
David Lindhagen certainly took
what he wanted, didn't he?
And I can guarantee you this:
He is opening the car door
for your wife right now.
What, you passing out?
Oh, boy.
- I think you're ready, pal.
- For what?
To talk to a pretty lady,
and take her home and show her your gift.
No. No, I'm not.


                                 Page 23/58

You're ready as you're ever gonna be.
You play your strengths, pal.
That's all any of us can do.
I'm mysterious.
I'm, you know, good in bed.
And you are a, uh...
...you know, stable and employed adult.
Jesus.
You see this lady over here at 9 o'clock?
You want me to hit on her?
No, I wanna hit on her.
The one behind her.
Oh.
- She's a fox, right?
- Mm-hm.
You think she came to a crowded bar
to have a quiet drink alone? She's hunting.
She's just looking for an opportunity to
settle for a responsible and stable adult.
And I'd like her to settle for you.
Oh. Well, thank you for the ego boost,
but you know what?
Just because I've watched you
pick up women...
...doesn't mean I know how
to pick up women.
- Ever see Karate Kid?
- What does that have to do with anything?
When he's teaching him to wax on and off
but really to fight?
You want me to fight someone?
What's the first thing I do
when I go up to a girl? I buy her a drink.
Yes, always. Without fail.
You buy her a drink.
Even if she doesn't want one,
you insist.
- And do I talk about myself?
- Never.
Never about yourself, always her.
- Because bar banter?
- Is boring.
So you put the impetus on her.
She has to be the interesting one.


                                 Page 24/58

""Impress me.
Impress me with how interesting you are.""
It's a big game. Game.
Creepy, creepy little game you play.
- That's judgmental, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.
At the end of the night
do I ask them to come home?
No, you tell them to come home.
They have no choice in the matter.
It is your choice and they are so overjoyed
to have had the opportunity...
...to make sweet, sweet love to you.
Oh, my God.
You did, you Miyagi'd me.
Honk.
Take your ring off. Let's go.
Just no talking about your kids, your job,
David Lindhagen, don't you dare.
Shut up, shut up. Just shut up.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Hi. Hi.
- Who are you?
- Hey. I'm Kate.
- Kate, you mind if I introduce you to my...?
- I'm Cal.
- I got this. Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.
And this is my friend Jacob.
He was just leaving.
- Oh.
- Oh.
So that's one way to treat people.
So can I buy you a drink, Kate?
- Oh. No, thank you.
- I'm gonna buy you a drink anyway.
Grey Goose, right?
Rocks. Two limes?
I'm five years sober.
- What can I get for you?
- Nothing. Nothing.
Go away, we're good.
Please don't come back ever.


                                 Page 25/58

- Ahem. So, what do you do, Cal?
- I don't know. What do you do, Kate?
- I asked you first.
- I asked you second.
Seriously, what do you do?
Seriously, what do you do?
Are you really not going to tell me
what you do?
Ah...
- Uh, okay, I'm a teacher.
- Boring.
Come on, you gotta keep it interesting.
Interest me.
Uh...
- I studied at Oxford for five years.
- Boring!
Wow. Teacher with an alcohol dependency
who studied at Oxford.
Blah, blah, blah. Bleh.
England. Yuck.
I think my friends just got here.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Okay, I'm in corporate insurance.
- Oh, God.
I have children, plural.
My wife was cheating on me
with Lindhagen...
...which I wasn't supposed to tell you.
Nice to meet you.
- What were you supposed to tell me?
- I don't know. I don't know.
I was supposed to say that you are the
perfect combination of sexy and cute...
...which is actually something
that I used to say to my wife.
But now it's become corrupted.
And I have 18 layers of clothes on.
I'm wearing a shirt and a tie
and a sweater and a suede jacket...
...that just seals in all the heat.
Seals in all the juices.
It's all sweat under here.
This is just sweat from here down.
This sweater, this is called slim cut,


                                 Page 26/58

but it feels like a scuba suit.
And I'm looking at your breasts.
What's that about?
You think I'm the perfect combination
of sexy and cute?
That's what you picked up
from what I just said?
Mm, mm.
- So this is my crappy apartment.
- Oh. Ooh.
Dumpy. That I had to move into
after my wife left me.
I love how you're being so honest.
- You like that?
- It's so different. It's so hot.
Okay. Okay.
- Aah! Ha, ha.
- Wow! Wow!
- More.
- Okay.
- Wanna hear something really hot?
- Mm-hm.
I've only had sex with one woman.
In my entire life.
- Honest or not honest?
- That's honest.
More! Tell me more.
I'm a little worried you have AIDS.
Just a little. Just a little bit.
It's okay, I'm not worried.
Oh, my God, this is so much fun.
What do you wanna do with me?
Oh...
I wanna show you off to my ex-wife
and make her really jealous.
Whoa, man.
Phew. Ha, ha.
You gonna call me?
Okay.
Yeah.
Wow, that is a great dress.
Where'd you get that?
Thank you. A store in Beverly Hills.
Really? Beautiful.


                                 Page 27/58

It was a gift from my grandmother.
- Really?
- It's a Krugerrand.
It's from South Africa.
I love it.
And I told him never to assume
anything.
And I've been to Maine, so that's a
sixth state. So I've been to six states.
- Oh, I love Maine.
- Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.
- Have you been to Waterville?
- I have, yeah.
Greece, Italy.
Greece, Italy?
Wanna get out of here?
- You're driving.
- I am.
I have never experienced that
in my life.
- Pretty great.
- Are most women like that these days?
- God bless technology.
- God bless it.
I went and met this girl the other night.
She was heckling me the whole time we...
I felt like I was doing it with the two
old guys from The Muppet Show.
- Ha-ha-ha. Statler and Waldorf.
- I was into it.
And she was like, ""Look at this frown
on your face. What is that?
You're so serious. What, it's serious
to kiss me? It's supposed to be fun.
Oh, my God, if it's gonna be hard work,
why don't you just stop?""
Hello?
Hey. Hot guy from the bar
who hit on you is here.
Tsk. Liz, I'm studying.
You should be studying the ceiling
of his bedroom.
I am eating a caramel apple.
In what world, honey?


                                 Page 28/58

Please, turn around. No.
Come on, take a break.
It'll be good for you to get out.
And by get out...
...I mean have hot guy from the bar knock
you into his headboard until you see God.
What is wrong with you?
You should be studying the curve
of his...
Okay, goodbye, Liz.
That too much? Hello?
Look, I gave him the cologne
like you told me to...
...and I don't think we should really
just dance on his grave.
I just thought you'd wanna know
what I heard about your old pal Cal.
What about Mr. Weaver, Mom?
Um, just, apparently, Mr. Weaver
has become a real ladies' man.
- What?
- Claire.
She should know. She babysits for him.
She's almost an adult. Lots of young
women in and out of his apartment.
She's too young for this.
I don't like this S-E-X talk in front
of the K-l-D-S.
First of all, they can spell.
Second of all, I'm just saying.
I think we were right in choosing Emily.
- Oh, um...
- Why are you following me?
Madison, I just had a question for you.
Okay, Jessica, what's up?
It's kind of on the personal side.
Yep, my lips are:
Seals. My lips are seals.
Okay. Um...
My question, and I don't mean to be blunt or
insulting, but let's just call it what it is.
You're always sleeping
with older guys, right?
- Always.


                                 Page 29/58

- Oh, um...
So my question for you, Madison,
is, um, how do you do that?
I mean, how do you get them to see you
as not just a kid in high school, you know?
But as someone that's mature,
and old, and that's...
Well, first off, I have a huge rack.
Uh, yes, you do.
You don't have a huge rack.
No.
- Wait, how old is he?
- Old.
Like really old?
- Like parent-old.
- Nasty, Jessica.
Yeah, because
that's what I was thinking, right?
- Rock on.
- Thank you.
- You are so dirty.
- Yes, I know.
Oh, okay. You gotta force his hand.
You know what I mean?
Go TMZ on his ass.
- Not following.
- A dirty picture.
- Oh. Oh.
- Make this face:
- Jeez, Madison. Stop.
- What?
You put that on his radar and he won't see you
as a little girl anymore, that's for sure.
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey. We don't know.
Behold.
Jessica Riley, you are my soul mate.
- The love of my life.
- Ha-ha-ha.
I have marked myself with a scarlet J
for you, Jessica.
Get down from there.
- Nathaniel Hawthorne... Are you mad?
- I am your babysitter. You get down.


                                 Page 30/58

Oh, my God.
- What are you thinking?
- Like the scaffold?
Took me like four weeks to make it.
It has wheels.
This has got to stop, Robbie.
- You'll learn to love me, I promise.
- No, I won't.
- Because I'm four years younger?
- Because I love somebody else.
Who is he?
He's older.
And I didn't want my parents to find out.
You know I'll kill him if he hurts you.
Yeah, I know.
Okay, Robbie, this has to stop.
Okay? No more.
Grow up.
I'll see you around.
Unh. Okay.
Okay.
So you're seeing Mom tomorrow
at my parent-teacher thing.
Yeah, no biggie.
What's with all the moping?
Uh, nothing. It's just...
There's a girl.
- A girl, huh?
- Uh-huh.
You like her?
I like Pringles.
I mean, this girl...
...she's incredible.
She's my soul mate, you know?
She doesn't even care.
But she's your soul mate, right?
Yeah.
Well, you just don't give up on her,
right?
Why not? You did.
I didn't give up.
Okay, it's more complicated than that.
I'm a different guy now.
You're not different.


                                 Page 31/58

You just have different clothes.
It's not that simple, kiddo.
- What kind of crap is that?
- Watch it.
You love her or you don't. I know you do.
I'm serious, Dad. I just need some
inspiration right now. All right?
Go get her back.
Wow, how old are you?
Wow.
You look great, Cal.
Oh. Ha, ha.
Well, it turns out I've been buying the
wrong size suit for like 20 years, so...
Oh, well, whatever.
You, um... You look great.
Thanks. You always look great.
Oh, thanks.
- So I spoke to Nanna yesterday.
- Yeah, me too. How'd she sound to you?
Um... Like Nanna. She worries about us.
What teacher is this?
Ms. Tafferty. She's the one he pulled
the Scarlet Letter asshole routine on.
Mm-hm.
God, he's such a weird kid.
- I kind of like him, though.
- Mm-hm.
Yeah, me too.
Glad we switched babies at the hospital.
Me too. That other one's in jail, probably.
So how's it going with David?
Oh, you know, it, um...
It wasn't, um...
That didn't mean anything.
- I mean, you know, if...
- No. No, I know.
You seeing anybody?
Me?
Mm-mm.
Oh, you know. Well, you hear things,
you know, so...
No. No. Not real...
You know me.


                                 Page 32/58

Yeah, well...
No.
I miss you, Em.
I made an effort when we were younger,
didn't I?
I mean, miniature golf and dancing.
You were such a great dancer.
I had to be.
You were such a good miniature golfer.
I just... I don't know. I guess I got lazy.
I got...
I got boring, is what I got.
No.
And I'm so mad at you.
I'm really mad at you for what you did.
But I'm mad at myself too.
Because I should not have jumped out of that car.
I should've fought for you.
Because you fight for your soul mates.
Least, that's what my 13-year-old son
tells me.
He's a really strange kid.
He scares the shit out of me.
I miss you too.
Mr. And Mrs. Weaver?
No way in hell.
- Cal, what are you doing here?
- Oh, you two know each other?
Yes. Yeah, right. We've met before, yes.
- ""We have met before""? Seriously?
- Mm-hm.
So I'd like to introduce you
to my wife, Emily.
Hi, I'm Robbie's mom.
She's your wife again. How convenient.
So shall we enter?
- Okay.
- Why don't we?
Yeah, let's do that.
I'm sorry. I'm playing catch-up.
How do you two know each other, exactly?
- Um...
- Um...
Maybe your husband should tell you.


                                 Page 33/58

We... I think we met at last year's
parent-teacher conference, wasn't it?
Did I miss it? Did I miss the
parent-teacher conference thing last year?
Yeah. I don't remember.
Why don't we just, uh, focus on Robbie?
Yes.
Yes, let's do that. Let's...
Let's focus on Robbie.
As you know,
Robbie's shining moment...
...was when he set a school record for
cursing in an eighth-grade English class.
Asshole. Ha-ha-ha.
You're familiar with this word,
Mrs. Weaver.
Yes, I am. And I've spoken to Principal...
Asshole. As in someone who tells
a woman that he'll call and never does.
Hmm.
Asshole. As in someone who uses
honesty to get a woman into bed with him...
...but is actually full of shit
like the rest of them.
- This is not about Robbie.
- Mm-mm.
Asshole. As in someone who allows
a woman to go downtown for 45 minutes...
...because he's nervous.
- All right, all right, all right.
- Ew. Ew. Oh.
You know what? Know what? No.
Here's the deal.
- She's an alcoholic.
- Aah!
- Oh, God. Okay.
- That's... I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. God.
- I gotta go.
- Aah!
- Oh, my God. Emily. God.
- Emily, Emily, wait.
- Leave me alone, Cal.
I'm sober five years, asshole!


                                 Page 34/58

Okay, yeah, I did. I did.
I slept with our son's eighth-grade
English teacher.
I know. I know.
And I cheated,
so I have no right to be angry.
Not the point. When we were
married you were the only woman...
...that I had ever slept with...
...and now I have had sex
with nine different women... God.
Nine?
Nine?
Wow.
You showed me.
I wasn't trying to show you.
I was trying to move on.
But I don't want to.
You've always been the only one.
Tell her she's the perfect combination
of sexy and cute, asshole.
You said that to her?
I did, yes.
Who are you?
I'm your soul mate.
What a clich.
You, get over here. Come on.
Yeah, yeah, give it up. Give it up for her.
Aw.
I'm so proud of you, baby.
I had my doubts, of course.
Hannah, I did tell you that tonight would
be a special night if you passed the bar.
So, Hannah...
...I would like to formally ask you...
...in front of all our friends
and colleagues...
...if you would like to become...
...a permanent lawyer at the firm
of Watkins, Goldberg and Schmidt? Huh?
How about that? Ha, ha. To you.
Whoo!
What?
- I ju... Um...


                                 Page 35/58

- What, what is it?
I thought that you were gonna propose
for some reason.
- What?
- Yeah. I know. I'm just...
It's just, uh, I'm a little thrown.
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize that you thought
that we were there.
Oh, no. God, no. Don't be silly. I just...
I need some time, I think...
...to figure out how I feel about us,
you know?
Brrp. Long-term.
You need some time?
You need some time to figure out
how you feel about us? Okay.
Honey?
- Wow. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha, ha. Wow.
- Ahem.
- Wow. Huh.
Wow.
This is actually really funny.
I'm just... Next level.
- Is this yours? Is this yours?
- Yes.
Mm. Mm.
Honey?
- Is this gin?
- Yes.
- There's, like, no water in that.
- Yeah.
- Great.
- Mm. Aah, I hate gin.
Wow, you know what?
Thank you, Richard.
Honestly, thank you very much
for your job offer. I will consider it.
Hannah Banana.
- Whoo! Ha, ha.
- Banana. Hannah.
- Do you wanna buy me a drink?
- Yes.


                                 Page 36/58

- It's nicer that way. Right?
- You.
You remember me?
Yeah.
- You still find me attractive?
- Yes.
Still wanna take me home?
Yeah.
Let's go.
Just one look
And I fell so hard
Here.
I really like this song.
This was a good choice. Yeah.
- Good song. You never hear this song.
- Mm-hm. Mm-mm.
Love this song.
Cheers.
How good it feels
Ugh.
That's not my drink.
Your love
Mm. Mm.
Ugh.
It's not my favorite. Thank you.
Forever
And always
- So is this how it normally works?
- What?
You put on the perfect song,
you make them a drink.
And I knew
And then you sleep together.
That you
Um...
Yeah.
I'm very nervous.
I'm getting that.
Okay. Because I know I seemed confident
back at the bar...
...but that was mostly just
because I was cold and wet...
...and trying to be dramatic
a little bit.


                                 Page 37/58

You're adorable.
No.
I am sexy.
- I am R-rated sexy.
- Mm-hm.
Okay, I know what happens in the PG-13
version of tonight, all right? I know.
It's that I get really drunk
and then I pass out.
You cover me with a blanket,
kiss me on the cheek, nothing happens.
But that's not why I'm here.
I am here to bang the hot guy
that hit on me at the bar.
- Jacob.
- Jacob.
- Are people still saying ""bang""?
- I do.
We are gonna bang. Hmm?
This is happening.
- Take off your shirt.
- Why?
Please, will you take off your shirt?
I can't stop thinking. I need to just...
- Okay, okay, okay.
- All right, okay, okay, okay.
Fuck.
Seriously? It's like you're Photoshopped.
Can l...?
Aah. You have cold hands.
- Now you take off your dress.
- No.
- Yes.
- No. Not with that going on. No, thank you.
Is there dim lighting somewhere?
Oh, God.
Okay, so then what do we do?
What happens now? Like, logistically?
- What's your move?
- What do you mean, what's my move?
- What's your move? Your big move?
- I got lots of moves.
- What's your big move?
- I'm not telling.


                                 Page 38/58

- Tell me your move.
- You're not ready for the big move.
- Yes, I am.
- You can't handle the big move.
- Tell me your big move.
- I work Dirty Dancing into the conversation.
Dirty Dancing?
- Can I sit down, please?
- Yeah.
- Can I put back on my shirt?
- No.
Why Dirty Dancing? What do we do?
Do we watch it?
You know the big move at the end where
Patrick Swayze picks up Jennifer Grey?
- Yeah.
- I can do that.
- Okay.
- So I tell girls I can do the move.
I put on the song ""Time of Your Life.""
I do the big move.
And they always wanna have sex
with me.
Oh, my God. That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.
I agree. But it works every time.
That would not work on me.
Oh, God, this is ridiculous.
I don't wanna do it.
Come on.
This is beyond ridiculous.
- Run and jump.
- No.
- Yeah. Come on.
- No, thank you.
Thank God I'm drunk. Here we go.
'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I owe it all to you
I've been waiting for so long
Now I've finally found someone
To stand by me
Ahem. So do you prefer to do it here
or in the bedroom?
The bedroom is preferred.


                                 Page 39/58

Mm-hm. Yeah, okay. Let's go there.
This pillow...
...forms perfectly
to the shape of my head.
Yeah.
Is this one of those foam pillows
from Brookstone?
Yeah.
- Yeah? Oh.
- Yeah.
I always wondered
who buys those kind of...
The hot guy from the bar buys these.
Of course.
- Jacob.
- Mm-hm, Jacob. Sorry about that.
Good.
I'm sorry, continue.
You don't have one of those ridiculous, um,
massage chairs, do you?
- You do?
- No.
- Yes, you do.
- Yeah, I do.
- Ha-ha-ha. Oh, my God.
- I don't. I don't. I do.
Who would have that?
I would. I have that.
- How much was it?
- Five thousand dollars.
Ask me how many times I've used it.
- How many times have you used it?
- Twice.
That's $2500 a massage.
Twice.
- Where is it?
- It's in the garage.
Can I sit in the massage chair?
I hate it.
The Home Shopping Network. But I'm addic...
I buy... I'm just the worst.
- Do you have a Slap Chop?
- Yes.
- The knife that cuts through the penny?


                                 Page 40/58

- Yes.
- Ha-ha-ha. What else do you have?
- Coin Bears.
Coin Bears?
You don't have Coin Bears.
I have a whole set from each state.
You have 50 Coin Bears?
- They have a coin in their foot.
- You stay up nights.
I am wildly unhappy.
I'm trying to buy it,
and it's not working.
- Were you smart in school?
- A little bossy, yeah.
But I won a spelling bee
and my dad cried at the spelling bee.
- No way. That's nice.
- Mm-hm.
- What word did you win on?
- It was so stupid.
I love curling up with
a rich cup of coffee.
What, you think coffee and sleep
don't mix?
Well, they do if it's High Point.
It's decaffeinated.
And the flavor is marvelous.
Do you have that mold that makes cakes...?
I have calf pants.
I have pants just for my calves.
Calf pants.
Oh, my God.
Could you do me a favor?
- What?
- Will you do me a kindness?
Mm.
Will you ask me something personal
about myself?
Hmm. Okay, fine. I'll do it.
And then we bang.
Yes.
What's your mother like?
My mom is very beautiful.
Um... Very vain.


                                 Page 41/58

Very smart.
Cold.
And your dad?
Um...
He died a long time ago.
He was such a sweet guy.
He was probably too sweet.
Very successful in business.
He made a lot of money,
which is why I have all this stuff.
But he was soft.
Just too soft, too sensitive.
And, you know, Dad,
he couldn't really handle my mother...
...and didn't really make an effort.
Hey, Jacob, it's Cal.
Where are you?
Remember the first woman I picked up,
that teacher?
Well, I have a story to tell you
about her.
It's been a week. I haven't heard
from you. Should I be concerned?
I am imagining you suffocating
under a pile of women. Call me.
Oh. Yeah, hey, it's me again.
Left like a hundred messages.
Listen, if this is a Miyagi thing,
I'm not getting it, so...
Call me back, please. Thanks.
- Been to St. Louis?
- No, I haven't.
I always dreamt of playing shortstop
for the St. Louis Cardinals, actually...
...but I couldn't hit a curveball,
so I did the next best thing.
Yeah, you became an accountant.
Right. Exactly.
I mean, the money's not as good,
but there's less travel.
Mm. Ha, ha.
- I was gonna be a ballerina.
- Really?
So tell me, what is it with women


                                 Page 42/58

and ballerinas?
I just pictured myself in the ballet.
It's not like I had
a lot of training or anything.
I mean, I actually never really
had a lesson...
...and, um, haven't seen a ballet.
You've never been to the ballet?
- Mm-mm.
- Wow.
- I'd love to take you to the ballet.
- You'd love to go to the ballet?
I didn't say that. I'd love to take you
to the ballet. I'd drop you off.
Later on I'd pick you up
and we could go to a ball game.
Oh, I get it.
- Ha, ha.
- I had a lot of fun tonight.
You like sushi? I know this really
great little sushi place...
I don't eat sushi.
That we're never gonna go to
because I hate sushi.
Oh, hi. Hi, Jess.
Uh, this is my work friend, David.
David is an accountant.
David, this is Jessica, my babysitter.
Uh...
So, you know, everything looks great.
Spreadsheets.
Spreadsheets.
See you at work.
Yeah, see you at work.
So how was dinner?
- Oh, well, you know, it was just for work.
- Yeah.
- That's a really pretty dress.
- Thank you. What do I owe you?
Do you know that your kids
are the only ones that I babysit for...
...that wanna stay awake so that they
can see their dad when he gets home?
Yeah, I mean, they fight with everything


                                 Page 43/58

they have to keep their eyes open.
And don't get me wrong...
...no, your kids are really excited to see
you when you get home too, Ms. Weaver...
...but not a lot wanna stay up for Dad.
Honey, what are you trying to say?
Batshit crazy.
Jessica, uh, what...?
- Let me give you...
- I don't want your slutty money.
Sweetheart, what's the pro...?
What's wrong?
""Slutty money""?
Kids.
Kids. Ice cream.
- I knew it. I knew it.
- Yeah. I'll be right back.
Oh, shit. Oh, God.
Hello?
- Hi, Cal.
- Hi.
Um...
So...
...I'm just calling, um...
...because I'm in the basement...
...and I'm trying to get
the water heater working, um...
...because the pilot light's out
and I don't know how to relight it.
So I'm sorry to bother you.
No, no. It's fine. That's fine. Call me...
I'm glad you called about this.
- I'll just walk you through it, okay?
- Okay.
All right, so there's a gray door.
You see the gray door?
- Yeah.
- Okay, just slide that down.
Okay.
There's a red button
with the word ""push"" on it.
I wrote the word ""push"" on it?
So you push it.
And you turn it to the right.


                                 Page 44/58

I got it.
And then just put the match in.
Oh, there it goes.
Just have to slide the gray door
down again and you're good to go.
Oh.
Well, thanks, Cal. I appreciate your help.
Oh, you know what? Just call anytime
with stuff like that. That's...
Oh, yeah. Uh...
Yeah. Oh.
Sure.
So I'll talk to you soon.
Yeah, and, um...
Thanks again.
No, that's... My pleasure.
Don't want you to blow up the house.
Bye.
Bye.
- Dad, can we go to McDonald's?
- Uh, no.
Why not?
Check it out.
Only reason they play them
is they're catchy.
- Thank you.
- Here you go, sir.
Now, does it come in sheets...?
Oh, yeah, it's a 4 by 8.
Standard 4 by 8, your 3/4 inch stock. Yeah.
- Now, this is for my wife.
- Oh. That's nice.
It has curtains.
- Oh, hey, Cal.
- Hey, Bernie.
- Hi, Mr. Riley.
- Hi, Mr. Riley.
- How's it going?
- Oh, good.
I'd love to catch up,
but I'm doing something to the house later.
Kind of in a rush.
Thanks for the cologne.
Do you know if this is chintz?


                                 Page 45/58

- Hello?
- Cal.
- Jacob.
- Oh, my God, it's alive.
Hey, sorry I kind of dropped off
the grid there, pal.
You left me in my hour of need,
my friend.
Yeah, well...
...I'm in a bit of a situation.
A pickle, if you will.
- I got no one else to call.
- Ha, ha.
- I met a girl.
- Oh, really?
I'm spending all this time with her
and she is a game changer.
She's a game changer? No way.
So much so I'm going to meet
her mother right now.
A mother and daughter. That's very
Wilt Chamberlain-esque, even for you.
- What is the matter with you?
- Ha, ha.
I don't know what to do.
I need some advice.
You might actually have to answer
some personal questions about yourself.
You gotta smile a lot.
You've gotta be charming.
Definitely don't be yourself.
That's what you've got for me,
don't be myself?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Great. Thanks for nothing.
Do you wanna get a?
Do you wanna get a beer next week?
You have my number.
And, you know, don't worry about tonight.
You'll be fine.
- Good for you, by the way.
- See you, buddy.
Honk. You gotta get that fixed.
- Okay. All right.


                                 Page 46/58

- Let's go.
Va-jay-jay.
... out of this fourth inning
with just one run in.
He's right on the verge of a big hit
knocking him out of the game here.
He's staying in there,
very competitive today.
No, no, no. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.
No, leave him. Let him go.
He can handle it. Let him go.
Honey! Get out of my purse.
Stay out of my purse!
Do not take those keys! Do not take those
keys! I'm not letting you take those keys.
You're not following your father!
Stop it!
No! No! Let your father handle it.
You're not to see that man again!
That man's a pervert!
- Stay out of it!
- No!
Is that pervert sexting you?
Hey, baby.
What are you wearing?
Dad's here. I have to blindfold you.
- Why? What's he doing?
- Just come on.
Hate this. Bad.
Is this something
I'm gonna have to clean up?
Mom, no, don't worry about it. Keep going.
- Honey, honey, I really can't see.
- Mom, I got you.
Two. Right now we're on the ground.
One more step.
- Three.
- Three. Yay.
Mom, no more steps.
We're on the ground.
Mom, relax.
It's your husband, not al Qaeda.
Hi, Em.
Oh, hey. Can I take this off now, please?


                                 Page 47/58

- Nope, not yet.
- Oh, what's this?
- I hear you, gigglepuss.
- Do it.
May I have your attention?
Many years ago, in the hallway
of Woodside Middle School...
...Cal Weaver saw Emily Boyle
for the first time.
Cal, are you seriously gonna do this
in front of the kids?
Mm-hm.
If anything goes wrong I'm supposed to
take her upstairs and put the TV on loud.
All right. Well, we may as well wait
for your daughter.
- She's right here.
- No, no, no. I mean our other daughter.
- Hello?
- Nanna.
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- What's going on?
Oh, I don't know. Some game.
He won't let me take this dumb blindfold off.
- Cal?
- Is that him?
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- Wait, do you guys know each other?
- What's going on?
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, Nanna.
- Hi, Robbie.
- Hey, Nanna.
- Hi, cutie.
Jacob, it's so nice to meet you.
I've heard so many wonderful things
about you from Nanna.
- I'm sorry, what's a Nanna?
- I am.
I couldn't say Hannah.
How do you know my dad?


                                 Page 48/58

She couldn't say her H's at all.
Okay. I'm having trouble understanding
what's going on right now.
- Dad, this is Jacob, my boyfriend.
- No, it's not.
- I was bringing him over to meet Mom.
- No. No. No, no, no.
- I wanna see the boyfriend.
- I can't breathe.
Can I take this off?
Cal, what are you doing
with a daughter that's grown up?
I was 17. That's why we had to get
married so young.
- You should have told me.
- Never wanted me to talk about my children.
- Um, I'm gonna go watch TV now.
- That's fine. Why don't you go do that?
- Yeah. Can I come?
- No.
So you guys, like,
really know each other, then.
Oh, screw it. This is ridiculous.
- Honey, he's really cute.
- No, he's not.
Look at you. You're really a mother?
I don't believe it, sister.
Let me get this straight.
So you guys are a thing.
You guys are a couple, right?
You guys are together?
- Yeah.
- No way. Break up right now.
- Daddy?
- Please don't call him that.
- Cal, that's not gonna happen.
- Then I will mess you up.
- Dad.
- Cal.
- Cal.
- Jessica?
Bernie?
Daddy, no.
I let her babysit for you,


                                 Page 49/58

you son of a bitch.
- She's only 17 years old.
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, God.
- No idea what you're talking about.
- Aah!
- Bernie.
Daddy, no. No, no, no. Stop it.
- Dad.
- Jacob! Oh, God.
Stop it. He didn't do anything.
- He doesn't know.
- Is your back okay?
- Know what?
- Know what?
Is this some kind of a skit?
Because I'm lost.
- Argh!
- No.
- Aah!
- No, no, no. Daddy, Daddy.
He didn't even know
that I'm in love with him.
- With who?
- With him.
- You pointing at me?
- You pointing at him?
She's pointing at him? Oh.
Wait. My dad is the older guy
you've been seeing?
- I knew it. You...
- He doesn't know about the naked photos.
- What?
- Jessica.
You made him naked photos? Seriously?
- I'm gonna beat you till your brains fall out.
- Timeout, timeout. Hold on.
- But I love her.
- Jessica's the one you're in love with?
Excuse me, Emily?
- You left your sweater in my car.
- Oh.
- Who are you?
- David Lindhagen.


                                 Page 50/58

- David Lindhagen?
- David Lindhagen.
Okay.
- Is this a bad time?
- Yeah.
- Unh.
- Jacob.
Know how much pain and suffering
you caused my friend?
- Stay the hell away from my daughter.
- Ow.
You stay away from my daughter.
- I don't even know you.
- Stop it.
Oh, my God. That is not...
What are you grabbing?
- Really? Really?
- Come on.
Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me!
- Come on, she's my daughter.
- Stop it. Stop it.
I'll kill you.
So...
Okay, wait. Which one of you
is Lindhagen again?
Hagen.
I'm just gonna write,
""Domestic disturbance, all clear.""
Thank you, officer.
Just simmer down, okay?
We all have arguments.
But if you're gonna fight, just do it inside.
Keep it in the family, okay?
I will kill you.
Let's go.
- Daddy?
- Now.
- Daddy?
- Now.
Cal.
Come on.
Honey.
This guy is a lowlife,
he is a womanizer.


                                 Page 51/58

- That's ironic.
- Excuse me?
I know him.
I have witnessed him in action.
- And you are not to see him anymore.
- Dad, I'm not gonna stop seeing him.
Okay. Okay. Well, then we have
nothing more to talk about.
- You're being unreasonable.
- Get out of my house.
This is not your house anymore.
Well, you made damn sure of that,
didn't you, sweetheart?
- Bye, Nanna.
- Bye, cutie.
She's all yours, David.
- Fantastic.
- Nice.
Go big or go home, right, bud?
Go home, Dad.
- Did you see the headline today?
- What?
It says that you should call your dad.
No, it says,
""Let's move on child obesity."" Ha, ha.
No, it doesn't.
- I'm not gonna call him.
- No, it says you really should.
Can I get you another?
- What time is it?

- 2:
In the afternoon.
""Two-thirty"" would have been sufficient...
...but thank you for the judgmental tone,
cocktail servant.
I'm sorry...
Sorry for being a dick.
Nice sweat suit.
What do you want?
- Uh, can I sit down?
- I don't know, can you?
Are we gonna be adults about this,
or we gonna...?


                                 Page 52/58

""Are we gonna be adults about this?""
- It would mean a lot to me if we could talk.
- Are you still seeing my daughter?
- Yes.
- Then I have nothing to say to you.
Been hanging out here a lot?
Sometimes.
- You been missing a lot of work?
- I have a lot of vacation days.
You know what? You have a lot of nerve.
Do you wanna do your shot?
She probably spit in it,
so, no, thank you.
Your kids miss you, Cal.
You're hanging out with my kids?
That's great.
Teach Robbie how to objectify women.
He'll love that.
You know it's his eighth-grade graduation
next week.
You gonna go to that?
Of course I'm going.
I just didn't know. You haven't really been
around. I don't think he knows either.
I haven't been around for him?
That's what you're telling me?
You know,
he's not my biggest fan right now.
- He thinks I stole his soul mate.
- He worships you, Cal.
- Is the parental advice over? Because if so...
- I'm in love with her.
I love her.
I don't know what I was doing
before this.
And I don't know what to do about it.
It's not something I can really stop.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- You love her? You love Hannah?
- Yes.
Tell me about it.
Tell me how much you love her.
I'm just...


                                 Page 53/58

Look, Cal, it's not something
that I wanted, okay?
I looked at people who were in love...
...and I thought
the way that they were behaving...
...and the things that they were doing
and saying...
...they appeared pathetic, honestly.
And I spent all this time with you,
I'm trying to make you more like me...
...and it turns out I just wanna be...
I need that drink.
You gonna make me do this?
I gotta really do this?
I had Hannah when I was 17.
I taught her how to ride a bike.
I taught her how to drive a car.
And I'm glad for you.
I'm happy for you, that you've changed.
I think it's fantastic
that you're a better man.
But I've seen too much already.
- No. I know. I know too much.
- I know. I know.
And it's Hannah.
And she's too good for you.
I agree.
I'm never gonna give you my approval.
You're a good dad, Cal.
Yep. Yep.
She spit. She spit in that.
Guys, I need you to pay attention.
Do not cut the line. I need everyone
to stay in your positions, okay?
Guys, check your ties.
Make sure everything is nice and neat.
Ladies, when you're on stage...
Mommy, look. Robbie's name.
Excuse me. Is this open?
- How close?
- Yeah, that's fine.
Good afternoon.
Welcome, parents, family and friends.
We're so pleased to have you here


                                 Page 54/58

to celebrate this graduating class.
And now, to introduce
our first student speaker...
...our very own Kate Tafferty.
- She's pretty.
- Ugh.
Our first speaker is not only
the class salutatorian...
...but is also...
...one of the most spirited young men...
...I've ever had the pleasure of teaching.
Ladies and gentlemen, Robbie Weaver.
- Whoo!
- Robbie!
Welcome, class of 2011.
Our time as middle schoolers
has come to an end.
We can't fight it anymore.
We're getting old.
All my life I wanted to grow up.
I wanted to grow older
so people would take me seriously.
It all sounded so good to me.
Growing up, getting a job,
getting married.
But...
...it's all a scam.
And love?
That's the biggest scam of all.
I was in love.
And I know that makes some of you laugh
because I'm only 13...
...but whatever. I was.
And I used to think, and really believe...
...that there was one true love
for everyone...
...and if you fought hard enough
for that person...
...your one true love
would always work out.
It sounded good to me when I was younger,
but it just doesn't work that way.
- There is no such thing as one true love...
- Stop.


                                 Page 55/58

Shit.
- Oh, boy.
- Okay.
All right. Ahem. Excuse me.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
I was wrong, Dad.
There's no such thing as...
I, uh...
Um...
Oh. Well, here's the thing:
My son's graduation speech sucks.
That's not a joke.
In fairness, I didn't know
where he was going with that.
But I think we can all agree...
...it was headed
in a kind of depressing, um, way.
My son... Not him, my actual son.
Believes in grand romantic gestures.
He believes in the existence...
...of one's soul mate.
And it's easy to just look
at a 13-year-old and say:
""You don't know what you're talking about.
You are wrong.""
But I'm not so sure.
I met my soul mate
when I was 15 years old.
We went out for ice cream.
After, my dad started teasing me
about my first date, the way dads do.
And I told him, ""Dad, it's no big deal.
I'm gonna be going out with a lot of different
girls on a lot of different dates.""
And that is the first time
that I ever lied to my father.
I met my soul mate
when I was 15 years old...
...and I have loved her
every minute of every day...
...since I first bought her
that mint chocolate chip cone.


                                 Page 56/58

I have loved her through the birth
of my three perfect children.
I have loved her
even when I've hated her.
Only married couples
will understand that one.
And I don't know if it's gonna work out.
I don't know what's gonna happen.
I'm sorry, Robbie, I can't give you that.
But I can promise you this:
I will never stop trying.
Because when you find the one...
...you never give up.
Do you have anything you'd like to say?
I still love you, Jessica.
And I love you, Emily.
I loved you ever since you first
changed my sister's diaper.
I loved you when you came into
my bedroom and I was under the covers...
- Stop him.
- No, no.
- What's he talking about?
- I'm not ashamed of it.
Okay, we're good, we're good.
Oh, there's your mom. Let's go say hi.
Hey.
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
There she is. My perfect girl.
Hi.
Okay.
So I bought a firearm...
...from a shady Internet site...
...and I am prepared to shoot you with it.
Come here.
Take care of her.
This is gonna be fun.
This is gonna be fun.
I'm gonna talk to my friends.
Go hang with the other high schoolers.
Go ahead, see if I care. I don't care.
I'm really glad you came.
So am I.
You were a really good babysitter,


                                 Page 57/58

Jessica.
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.
- I thought you weren't giving up.
- I'm not.
But I just figure...
...you like my dad...
...and in a few years I'll look like him.
I'll come for you then.
That's not a bad plan.
But...
Well, until then...
...just a little graduation gift
to get you through high school.
Thanks.
So...
Can you...?
- Why...?
- Take care, Robbie.
Holy crap.
- He looks pretty happy.
- Yeah.
- God, I hate that haircut, though.
- Ick.
- I know. He looks like a sheepdog.
- Mm-hm.
Oh, my eyes! My eyes! My eyes!
It's been a really hard year.
How so?
Yeah, there were a couple little blips,
I guess.
- I know.
- I guess I just, you know...
Really what I want to say...
...is that I'm so glad you bought me
that ice cream.
Me too.

Defending Your Life
      By Albert Brooks




          Page 1/49

I was thinking this morning:
In two months,
I will have been here ten years.
And you're like my real family.
Isn't that tragic?
My mother called
and wished me happy birthday...
...and hinted to the fact I wasn't making
enough money.
If you can call, ""Still making
the same salary, honey?"" a hint.
My ex-wife used to say that too,
but she never used the word ""honey.""
-In three years, can I double my income?
-Good luck.
-Four years?
-Maybe.
You're great people
and this is a great present.
I wish I could squeeze all of you
into one pretty woman.
If you'd like to go into my office, I'll try.
Thanks a lot.
I'll be home soon.
I'm taking Daniel to get his new car.
-What'd he get?
-BMW convertible.
Oh, my God. Leather?
-Leather?
-Oh, yeah.
-I want one.
-All right. Kiss Alex for me.
-I want one.
-She says, ""happy birthday.""
These are great. Thanks.
-Just stuff I like.
-It's great.
Why do you drive this?
I see people driving these.
What, is a flood coming?
Hoover Dam broke?
I like this car.
It's a battering ram.
This is what Patton drove.


                                 Page 2/49

""Hey, you, soldier, forward.""
In an 8.5 earthquake, you'll beg for a Jeep.
In an 8.5 earthquake, I'll beg for a coffin.
-What are you doing tonight?
-Taking a long drive.
-Alone?
-Unless someone comes with the car.
You don't want to be alone
on your birthday.
What better day to be alone?
I don't have that hang up
about birthdays and parties.
You're born alone, celebrate it.
Celebrate aloneness.
That's what birthdays are for.
Never thought of that.
It's a pitiful theory.
I've had these cars before
and there's something wrong.
The smell is making me sick.
That's a normal smell.
That's a protective coating,
it's not oil burning.
-You look fantastic. You lose weight?
-Did I what?
I was talking to someone else.
-Did any lights come on the dash?
-I don't think so.
That means you're okay.
If there's any trouble, they come on.
We have a saying around here.
""If you smell something
and don't see lights, try dry cleaning.""
Try what?
She has no sense of humor.
Dry cleaning?
If it smells on Monday, bring it in.
-I'm sure it's nothing.
-I'm sure it's something.
Trouble with a new car?
She's a lunatic. Boy, you have lost
a lot of weight!
A lot of weight?
You saw me three days ago.


                                 Page 3/49

You look different. Why?
I don't know.
I just wrote you a check for $39,000.
That's it. That's the look. $39,000 lighter.
Let's go get it.
Let's get her.
What's in the box?
-It's my birthday. I got a CD player.
-Happy birthday.
-You got a CD player in the car.
-No, I don't.
You paid for it.
You wanted the best.
The best radio comes with a CD.
You'll love it.
There she is.
It's gorgeous!
Look at it. It looks huge! It's beautiful!
That's not it. That's a 750. That's it.
What a cutie.
Try not to show the 750 first.
My car looks like a turd now.
If I had to choose between this car
and yours, I'd take yours every time.
You're an idiot, Jim.
Do we all have to hear that?
Come to me.
Good afternoon,
and welcome to Judgment City.
You just had quite a journey,
so relax and enjoy the ride.
Considering your recent transformation,
you won't have any choice.
If we've done our work correctly...
...you should all be from
the western half of the United States.
Even though this isn't the Earth...
...our surroundings should seem pleasing
and very familiar to you.
Why you're here...
...and what you'll be doing
will be explained later.
No need to worry about that now.
Soon we'll be dropping you off


                                 Page 4/49

at your hotel.
You'll sleep tonight and when you awake...
...you'll feel wonderful and raring to go.
You'll find many activities to enjoy
in Judgment City.
How many like to play golf?
You won't be able to get
your hands up yet...
...but we have
three championship golf courses.
Sit back and have fun.
You'll be here for five days
and we want you to enjoy yourselves.
Those staying at the Continental Hotel
will be escorted from the tram.
The rest of us will depart momentarily.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
My name is Stan.
Because of what you've been through,
you'll want to go fast asleep.
You're already checked in.
Nothing to worry about tonight.
Everything will be explained tomorrow.
Have a good rest.
If you have any questions, I'm here to help.
Thank you.
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Miller, this is your room.
Make yourself at home.
I'll be right back.
All the clothing you'll need for the time
you're here is in this closet.
We call these tupas.
They're like caftans. They fit everyone.
Would you like to shower,
or are you too tired?
Too tired?
I understand. There are five channels
of programming on the television.
Channel 3 tells you about Judgment City.
Have a wonderful night's sleep.
If I can do anything, I'm at your service.
I'd be surprised if there's anything in there,


                                 Page 5/49

but I appreciate the attempt.
Sleep well.
Good morning, Alan.
Good morning, Philip.
Glad you could make it, Leonard.
-Good morning, Susan.
-Good morning, Mr. Diamond.
-Who's prosecuting?
-Lena Foster.
She'll have a field day with this.
She lost last Thursday.
Really?
There is a God.
Okay, call him up, please.
-Hold on for Bob Diamond, please.
-Who?
Daniel?
Diamond here. How are you? Good sleep?
-Yes.
-Amazing, isn't it?
Listen, you're going to get up, shower,
put on those nice clothes...
...and take a tram downtown
and come see me this morning.
Do you know what's going on?
No.
In a nutshell, you're here
to defend your life. And I'll help you.
Defend my life?
Soon, you'll be smarter than anyone
you've ever met.
Sound exciting?
I guess.
It is, believe me.
Did you eat breakfast yet?
No.
I've got good news for you.
It's not only the best food you'll ever have,
but you can eat all you want.
I can what?
As long as you're here, you can eat
all you want. You won't gain weight.
So pig-out. Eat 30 hotcakes.
I'll see you at 11:00.


                                 Page 6/49

Eat all I want?
Eat everything. Take care.
I've loved you from the day I met you.
When did you meet me?
Do you remember?
Don't do this to me.
Of course, I remember.
What's my middle name?
-You never told me.
-It's the first thing I told you.
In which life?
In which life?
That's it, Lenore. You tried,
and you failed. The game is over for you.
Stay here and someone
will come and get you.
Stu, the decision is yours.
Do you want to stop here,
or face your fear?
I'll face the fear.
He's facing his fear!
You might just get a hole in one.
Want to eat a lot?
Ted's House of Buffet says you can have
everything you see, plus more.
Our chefs will cook it, but they won't look.
Like to horseback ride?
Judgment Stables, open till sunset,
welcomes you.
If your trial's through early,
come ride with us.
Good morning.
Good morning.
""Take the eggs, I pray thee.""
What's good here?
Everything is sensational.
-How's the cheese omelet?
-Sensational.
-I'll take it and some orange juice.
-I'll be right back.
Was this made for somebody else?
No, just for you.
That fast?
Fast and delicious. Eat all you want.


                                 Page 7/49

-Delicious.
-That's nice.
A red tram is leaving right now
that will get you into town by 11:00.
To make sure you're on time,
you should leave now.
These are the best eggs I ever had.
Of course.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the lnner City Transport System.
Please remain seated
until the tram comes to a full stop.
Never exit the tram once it's moving...
...because of the electronic field
surrounding the moving vehicle.
So young. AIDS?
Car accident.
Oh, my God!
-But you feel okay now, don't you?
-Yes, I do.
Me, too.
Isn't it amazing? ls this what you thought
it would be? I certainly didn't.
I don't know what it is yet. Do you?
No, I guess I don't.
You make me think of my little poodle.
Do you have a dog?
I did have a dog.
I'll tell you about my dog.
I had a little...
-Have you got a while?
-Yeah, go ahead.
They let us on the train in those days.
We didn't have to put him in baggage.
Every time the conductor came around,
he knew it.
And he would crawl down
in the corner of the bag.
-Did you have a dog?
-You asked me that twice.
-What did you say?
-Yes.
-What did I say?
-It's wonderful.


                                 Page 8/49

Well, it is.
Mr. Miller, welcome. I'm Helen,
one of Mr. Diamond's assistants.
Come with me, please.
-Looks familiar, right?
-I was just thinking that.
It was designed to be as stress-free
for you folks as possible.
If we can do anything to make it
more like Earth, we have suggestion boxes.
We'd like your opinion.
If you want to make it more like Earth,
you should build some mini-malls.
It's funny you should say that.
Six just opened up outside of town.
I hear they're lovely.
I never go because I don't like yogurt
and I do my own nails.
Mr. Diamond will be with you shortly.
Daniel, Bob Diamond.
Come in.
How are you?
Sit down, my friend.
What's wrong?
You look good in that tupa.
Some people don't, but you do.
It's flattering to you.
So, is this what you thought it would be?
Thought what would be?
Where am l? Heaven?
No, it isn't heaven.
-Is it hell?
-No, it isn't hell either.
Actually, there is no hell. But I hear
Los Angeles is getting pretty close.
Daniel, let me tell you what's going on.
When you're born into this universe,
you're in it for a long time.
You have many different lifetimes.
After each one...
...there's an examining period,
which you're in now.
Every second of every lifetime
is recorded...


                                 Page 9/49

...and as each one ends,
we sort of look at it.
Look at a few of the days, examine it...
...and if everyone agrees,
you move forward.
-What do you mean ""move forward""?
-Continue onward.
The point of the whole thing is
to keep getting smarter.
To keep growing...
...to use as much of your brain as possible.
I use 48 percent of my brain.
How much do you use?
I'm sorry?
I use 3 percent of my brain?
Don't worry. Everybody on Earth
uses 3 percent of their brain.
3 to 5 percent.
That's why they're there.
3? 3 percent?
No one on Earth uses more than that?
When you use more than 5 percent
you don't want to be on Earth.
Though your take-out places are lovely...
...there are more exciting destinations
for smarter people.
Being from Earth as you are,
and using as little of your brain as you do...
...your life is devoted to dealing with fear.
It has?
Everybody on Earth deals with fear.
That's what Little Brains do.
What are ""Little Brains""?
That's what we call you folks
behind your back.
Forgive me.
Who are you?
I'm just like you.
I was on Earth a long time ago.
But I advanced, I moved forward.
I got over my fears.
And I got smarter.
Did your friends' stomachs hurt?
-Everyone of them.


                                 Page 10/49

-It's fear.
Fear is like a giant fog.
It blocks everything.
Real feelings, true happiness, real joy.
They can't get through that fog.
But you lift it...
...and you're in for the ride of your life.
God, my 3 percent is swimming.
-What are you reading?
-You wouldn't understand.
Just numbers.
-You read numbers?
-Yes, sir.
I'm on trial for being afraid?
First, I don't like to call it a ""trial.""
Second, yes.
-What happens if I'm guilty?
-Don't think ""innocent"" or ""guilty.""
Worse comes to worse,
you'll go back to Earth and try again.
You keep going back until you get it right?
Not forever.
Eventually, they'll throw you away.
-Have I been to Earth before?
-Yeah.
-How many times?
-Approaching 20.
-Is that a lot?
-I was there six.
My God! So I'm the dunce of the Universe.
We've had people
who have been there 100 times.
I wouldn't want them as friends,
but we've seen them.
If you're defending me,
is there a prosecutor?
Damn good one. Lena Foster.
We call her ""The Dragon Lady.""
That's our prosecutor?
-Who does she work for?
-The Universe.
The Universe is like a big machine,
and we are parts.
If a bad part gets through


                                 Page 11/49

before it's ready...
...the whole machine breaks down.
We're here to make sure you're ready.
-What do they look at exactly?
-I can't tell you that exactly.
But I can tell you
it's nine days from your life.
Nine days.
So my trial goes on for nine days?
No. All the trials last four days.
We look at nine days, or episodes,
from your life.
-Tell me which days.
-I'm not allowed.
Is that a normal number? High? Low?
ls that a good number?
You're very concerned about normal.
Kind of cute.
I'd prefer seven, but nine's fine.
Some have twelve.
-Hungry?
-Starving. I didn't have time to eat.
Well, Mr. All-You-Can-Eat, let's stuff.
Come on.
We have about 400,000 residents here.
We service half of the US's dead.
About 2,500 people a day.
Do children come here?
Children don't have to defend themselves.
When a child is taken,
they automatically move forward.
Isn't that nice?
Any teenagers?
Too much trouble. They go elsewhere.
We tried, but they damaged the tupas.
Too rowdy.
How is your chicken?
Delicious.
-What are you eating?
-You wouldn't like this.
What does it taste like?
You're curious, aren't you? I like that.
-Want to try?
-Yeah. Looks so weird.


                                 Page 12/49

-Oh, my God!
-Like horseshit, huh?
As you get smarter,
you manipulate your senses.
This tastes different to me than to you.
This is what smart people eat?
So talk to me. Tell me about your life.
You feel you had any problems?
Sure. I had some problems.
Everybody has problems, don't they?
Everybody on Earth.
Did you give a lot to charity?
A lot?
A lot of money. Did you donate things?
This isn't a good or a bad thing.
I'm merely curious.
I'm sure I could have given more.
I gave a lot to street people,
but you never get a receipt.
How much do you have to give?
What's the total?
Don't worry.
Relax.
There was one person
you were really cheap with.
Over and over again.
I wish you'd been more generous with him.
Who?
You.
-I got to go.
-Where do you go now?
You wouldn't understand.
That's not an insult. I mean it literally.
Get out tonight. Have some fun.
You know what you might try?
Get over to the Past Lives Pavilion.
What is that?
It's where you see
the people you've been before.
You see yourself in other lives?
Most people love it,
but some it makes nauseous.
Don't worry about it.
Take care.

Want to take that chicken with you?
They love putting things in bags.
If you need to talk to me at any time,
just call.
-I never sleep.
-Never?
I do have a question.
I'll call you later.
You're already checked in. You have
nothing to worry about tonight.
Everything will be explained to you
in the morning.
If I told you how old this man was,
you wouldn't believe me.
Should I tell them?
We're talking light years.
Light years. He looks good though.
No prostate, but he looks fine.
You're looking at me like stunned sheep.
Come on!
What is this, a white sale?
I'm going to tell you a story.
About a year ago,
this Little Brain comes in here.
I'm talking...
...half a percent of his brain at the most.
He orders a piece of pie,
he forgets what it is.
He looks down, doesn't know what it is.
It's a piece of pie.
I say, ""What are you doing?""
He says, ""I'm waiting to make a call.""
I say, ""Does that look like a phone?""
He says, ""It is a phone.""
The joke is on me.
He picked up the pie and called his mother!
Folks, come on, please.
Stay with me here.
You're on trial, not me.
-Hi. What's your name?
-Arthur.
-Hi, Arthur? Where were you from?
-Denver.
-Lovely city, Denver, Arthur. Did you ski?


                                 Page 14/49

-No.
No.
-How'd you die?
-I was in a coma.
I'm sorry. How long were you in a coma?
I really don't know.
Let's play a game.
-Elvis. Living or dead?
-Living.
Long coma, Art.
Long coma.
Have a nice day.
-What's your name?
-Ernie.
Hi. Having a good time in Judgment City?
It's fun. The food's good.
It is. Have you been to the stables?
Like to horseback ride?
Not very much.
There's a nice-looking young man.
Hi. How'd you die?
On stage, like you.
Funny. Maybe you should come up here.
No, thank you.
Of course, he doesn't want to.
This is very hard work, but I love it.
And I love you, Little Brains.
Have you heard any Little Brain jokes?
I know you, right?
I hope so. Who are you?
-I'm Julia.
-Hi. I'm Daniel.
-You know me?
-I thought I did.
You weren't in the bus, were you?
-What bus?
-I hit a bus.
No. I don't think so.
Sit down.
I'm sorry, you really look...
-...so familiar to me.
-Really?
Maybe because I'm the only man
under 100.


                                 Page 15/49

That could be it.
I want to tell you a true story.
Three months ago,
six dead people came in.
Obviously, humor has nothing to do
with brain size.
Obviously.
Do you want to take a walk
or do you want to stay and see the show?
I have to. That's my dad.
I'm kidding.
-That would be so sad for me.
-Awful.
So, the moral of the story is,
if you got to fart, go outside.
Let's go.
Folks, please.
-Please, you don't want to miss the song.
-We'll get the record.
Please.
Ed and I'd like to do a beautiful song.
One of your favorites.
We'll do it a bit different.
This is from me...
...to you.
""That was life
""That's how you lived it
""And now you Little Brains
are here to defend it""
I'm glad we stayed.
Let's go.
""You'll do just swell and if not
""You'll go to hell"" Just kidding!
-What's that?
-What?
I don't believe you.
You'll make a great baby in the next life.
Didn't anyone ever tell you,
you carry yourself very stiffly?
Leave me alone. I'm dead.
-How many days are you looking at?
-My lawyer says nine.
-You call him a ""Iawyer""?
-What do you call yours?


                                 Page 16/49

Sam.
You call him by his first name?
It never occurred to me to do that.
I bet you called everybody
by their first names.
What was your butcher's name?
Pete.
-What about your mailman?
-Jesse. What was your mailman's name?
No idea.
He was coming to my house
for over a decade and I couldn't tell you.
-Didn't you get him a Christmas present?
-Liquor. I just put it in the box.
-I don't suppose you had a butcher?
-Steve.
-Steve Rubin.
-Seriously?
He wasn't a professional butcher.
He was a buddy who liked to cut meat.
You'd bring him a steak, he'd cut it.
-How many days are you looking at?
-Four.
That's all?
That means you'll go on.
I hope so.
-Sam thinks so.
-Sam does?
Yeah.
I hope you and Sam are very happy.
I'll write to you from hell.
I like this.
-Were you married?
-Yes.
-Children?
-No.
What about you?
I had a girl and I adopted a boy.
How old were they?
Stephanie was 7 and Adam was 9.
I bet they miss you.
I'm sure they do.
I miss them.
But I feel okay about it. Don't you?


                                 Page 17/49

I didn't know them that well.
It does, it feels okay.
They say they make it that way so we
can look at our lives without distractions.
My lawyer Bob told me the same thing.
But wouldn't you call this...
...a distraction?
-But isn't eating all you want a distraction?
-Isn't it the best?
I had a dream that I'd go to a place
where I could eat all I want...
...and now I'm here!
You dreamed about this place?
I was dreaming
about the Sizzler near my house.
What about your husband?
Did you have a good marriage?
Parts of it were okay.
What about your wife?
I got married too young.
-How old were you?
-Seventy-one.
-What did she look like?
-Very pretty. Too pretty.
You should be with a person who's just
good-looking enough to turn you on.
Any excess brings problems.
She was much prettier than I needed.
Never heard that theory before.
So you like your lawyer?
He's brilliant.
You know how big his brain is?
I came from a world filled with penis envy
to a world of brain envy.
How big is his brain?
-What's this?
-It's my hotel.
-This is your hotel?
-Yeah. Where are you staying?
At the place for people who weren't
generous and didn't adopt anybody.
I'm at the Continental. Come over one day.
We'll paint it.
Tomorrow after the trials,


                                 Page 18/49

do you want to have dinner?
I can't tomorrow.
-You can't?
-No, I'm sorry.
You can't have plans here already?
Should I call you in two weeks?
Sam is having a small dinner party.
He said there'd be very smart people there
and asked me to go.
Sam again.
I hope you're not dating your defender.
I know in my heart it's wrong.
I'll call you after the dinner.
We can talk on the phone.
It'll give me time to have sex
with my prosecutor.
Good luck tomorrow.
Good night.
Champagne and caviar now being served
in the Blue Room.
Daniel! Right here!
How are you feeling, buddy?
Doing all right? Let's go.
-Nervous?
-No. Should I be?
I wouldn't be.
-What did you do last night?
-I met this amazing woman.
You met a girl? You're kidding me!
What are you laughing at?
It just sounds funny.
Two days after the car accident
and you're in love.
I've done this a million times
and every time it feels like new.
Here we are.
Ready?
Hello, Robert.
Well, well. If it isn't my old friend.
I heard we lost last Thursday.
-Leave it to you to greet me with that.
-Turnabout's fair play.
I'm going to get you.
I promise.


                                 Page 19/49

Don't make conversation.
Are you two feuding?
It isn't a feud. Feuding suggests
at one time you liked each other.
We never did.
-This should be a mistrial.
-It's not a trial.
Then it's a mis-whatever it is.
You two are already fighting.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
I'm sure your defender explained
the basics to you, but let me just say...
...even though this feels like a trial, it isn't.
It's just a process that helps us decide.
As imperfect as it may be,
we think it works quite well.
What you'll see on the screen...
...will look and feel so real to you,
you might be uneasy at first.
Just relax. After a while, I think
it will become pleasurable to you.
They tell me it feels something like 3-D.
Any questions, Mr. Miller?
You may begin.
Thank you, Your Honors.
Over the following four days,
I will attempt to show that Daniel Miller...
...while he is a quality human being,
is still held back...
...by the fears that have plagued him...
...lifetime after lifetime.
I believe that I can show
without a shadow of a doubt...
...that he must once again be returned
to Earth to work on this problem.
May we begin in childhood, please?
Could we go to...
...11-4-19?
By the way...
...this signifies you're 11 years,
four months and 19 days old.
-Is that clear?
-I think so.


                                 Page 20/49

In other words, if I said, 9-2-17...
...you would be nine years,
two months and 17 days old.
I understand.
Realistic, isn't it, Mr. Miller?
-Look what I found.
-Give me that.
Make me.
Why don't you make me?
You can't make me
because I'll beat the shit out of you.
You couldn't.
Hit him, Daniel!
Come on!
Chicken! Hit me right here.
Come on, chicken.
Hit him, Daniel!
Stick up for yourself, low-life chicken.
That's too bad.
Come over to my house later
and I'll help you glue it back together.
What were you feeling as you watched
that episode?
It felt strange to watch myself.
Is that what you mean?
I mean emotionally.
What kind of feelings did this bring up?
Frustration?
It's not a test. There's no right answer.
Is that what you felt?
Frustration?
I guess.
Why were you afraid?
I object.
How did we introduce the word ""afraid""?
From frustration to ""afraid""?
This is already pronouncing him guilty.
-Could we use another word?
-Which one?
What word would I use?
How about ""restraint""?
I think the little boy was dignified.
""Restraint""?
May I show you what I mean?


                                 Page 21/49

Be my guest.
Your Honors, may we go to 1-8-17, please?
What are you accusing me of?
Say it to my face!
-What?
-You never think about my problems.
-Lower your voice.
-Lower my voice?
Don't yell in front of the baby.
It's always the baby. What about me?
I live here, too!
I work hard to pay for this house!
-I know you do!
-The minute I earn it, you spend it!
You think I spend too much?
All I do is scrimp!
If you don't like it,
then why don't you leave?
Stop it! This happens when you drink!
Lecture time!
Just sit down and join the lecture!
Don't touch me!
In that brief moment,
when that baby and his father's eyes met...
...this child learned the meaning
of restraint.
He wasn't afraid. He was mature.
He was non-violent. Dignified, I call it.
My colleague may believe in
""Hit first, ask questions later""...
...but we're not all that way.
I resent that.
Let's ask Mr. Miller. In the schoolyard,
did you want to hit that child back?
I wanted to hit him back,
but I felt restraint.
You felt restraint. I see.
Is restraint always
the best course of action in every case?
No.
Wouldn't this have been a case
to not restrain yourself?
If you had stuck up for yourself...
...this event would not have haunted you


                                 Page 22/49

all your life.
You never forgot this.
You always thought about it.
Hold on. People think about lots
of things throughout their entire life.
You're isolating this incident?
Aren't we here to isolate incidents?
Or maybe I don't understand the job.
Your Honors, to save valuable time...
...l submit 11-4-19 as shown
without further comment.
I'm fully satisfied. I love watching this kid.
Anything you want to say?
I feel very good about the ""restraint"" idea.
Thank you.
You're up.
While we're still in childhood...
...l'd like to show something
absolutely extraordinary.
Could we go to 10-9-15, please?
I'm on probation for stealing books.
They're going to think I stole this.
I'll be expelled.
You won't.
Of course, I will. I'm already in big trouble.
Good afternoon.
Continue working
on the assignment you began last Tuesday.
Take these.
-I'll say I lost mine.
-You'll be in trouble.
Just do it.
Where are your supplies?
-I left them at home.
-Left them?
I lost them.
Did you lose them or leave them?
Both. I left them and lost them.
Where are your supplies? Do you know
how much such these things cost?
-Class, tell Daniel how much paint costs.
-$10.
-And the brushes?
-$3.


                                 Page 23/49

-What's the total?
-$13.
You can't be an artist without paint.
Like you can't swim unless you get
in the water. You must have paint.
This is careless behavior.
I have to call your father today.
Somehow, you must pay for this.
Yeah.
You got in quite a bit of trouble for that.
But you felt your friend would have been
punished worse.
At 10 years old, he showed
the kind of courage most adults never find.
I let the life stand for itself here.
Could we go to 10-9-15?
The evening of that same day.
-How will you pay for this?
-I don't know!
I'm very disappointed in you.
I'm sorry.
-We must punish you severely.
-We don't have to!
Yes, we do.
First of all, no television for a month.
I didn't do it! Steve did! It's Steve's fault!
What?
Steve lost the paints.
He probably stole them.
I didn't do it.
Punish him!
What happened to your friend Steve?
Do you remember, Mr. Miller?
What do you mean?
He was expelled from school
two days later, isn't that right?
I thought he left on his own.
What's the point?
I'm looking at the results
of what you call a courageous act.
Mr. Miller might have acted bravely
in class...
...but we just watched him crumble
a few hours later, and why?


                                 Page 24/49

At the threat of no television?
I was ten years old. Television is
everything to a ten-year-old.
It's like heroin. You can't just pull it away.
I never wanted to watch.
My parents made me because they wanted
to go out and I got hooked.
Miss Foster and I
have had this argument before.
I think the act itself is what's important.
She wants to keep enlarging it
until everything loses meaning.
If I fixed a flat tire on your car and
two years later I lose your garden hose...
...according to you,
I won't get credit for the flat.
I'm just the dummy who lost the hose.
Let me suggest this.
Did we ever consider that
this boy had a bond with his father?
It had nothing to do with his friend.
I just think Daniel couldn't lie to his dad.
That's all.
You're nodding, Mr. Miller.
Does that mean you agree?
I had a bond with my father.
I pretty much never lied to him.
You never lied to your father?
Would you like to see
at least 500 examples?
I said, ""pretty much.""
I didn't say, ""never, ever lied.""
You have to lie sometimes...
...in an emergency.
It doesn't mean that the bond is affected.
If you've got the bond,
the bond's always there.
Even if you lie sometimes,
you won't interfere with it.
You know, the bond can wait for a little lie.
In the end, it's there for you.
Sometimes in the middle of a lie...
...l found that the bond would kick in.
Maybe squeeze a little truth out.


                                 Page 25/49

Wrap it up.
I am through.
Very good day. I'm pleased.
She's tough, isn't she?
If I told you how tough,
you wouldn't sleep, believe me.
Well, I'm off. You call me if you need me.
You going out with that gal tonight?
I can't. She's busy.
Busy?
I'll be damned.
-How are you?
-Fine. And you?
Some sake.
How are you?
-What's good?
-Everything.
Everything.
What's this? It looks like a worm.
Our resident food.
How does it taste?
You'd throw up.
I'll have the tuna.
Very good tuna.
Very fast.
So I've been told.
Delicious!
Like it?
Thank you very much.
How many days?
How many days you looking at?
Nine.
Nine days?
Oh, my God! Nine days!
You better have more sake!
9 days?
I have 15.
My name's Frank.
Fifteen days?
-Is that a lot?
-I don't know.
How'd you die, Dan? May I call you Dan?
I got hit by a bus.
-And you?


                                 Page 26/49

-Got shot in the head.
Really? Murder?
Hunting accident.
Some putz thought I was an animal.
-How'd you make a living?
-Advertising.
-And you?
-Made a lot of money in adult books.
Selling them?
No, reading them.
Yes, of course, selling them.
Were you from LA?
-Know the night clubs by the airport?
-Those strip clubs?
I coined the phrase, ""All nude.""
-What do you mean?
-That was mine.
I bought two clubs.
They were only using the word ""nude.""
I put up ""Totally all nude.""
Doubled business in a month.
I got to piss. You?
Thank you very much.
I'm not leaving. I'm going to take a piss.
Take a piss!
-Hello.
-Mr. Miller?
I have a message for you.
You do?
Here it comes.
Hi. Where are you?
I'm going to sleep.
Tomorrow, when you're done...
...meet me by the main entrance.
I'll be there.
I miss you. Isn't that funny?
Good night.
This is wild.
Let me get this straight. You actually
had sex with Benjamin Franklin?
Twice.
How was he?
He was fat, Bob.
I couldn't believe it.


                                 Page 27/49

It's wonderful. I'd forgot all about it.
He was willing to sleep underwater.
Marvelous.
Good morning.
Good morning. I'm Dick Stanley.
I'm going to defend you today.
I'm going to defend you today.
Mr. Diamond couldn't make it.
He couldn't make it? You're kidding.
He'll be back tomorrow.
How can you? You don't know me.
Mr. Miller, I use 51 percent of my brain.
I know everything about you.
51 percent? That's clocked?
Clocked.
Impressive.
I'll lose. I can't start over again with you.
I operate differently than Diamond.
Without tooting my own horn,
I'm quite good at this.
I'm familiar with your life
and I want you to trust me.
I'll lose.
Thank you so much. That was so nice.
It was nothing.
Good morning. Your Honor,
my defender is not here this morning.
Under the circumstances,
this puts me at a disadvantage.
It's quite common.
Mr. Stanley will do fine. Begin.
Today I would like to begin
with an episode in the 24th year of life.
Mr. Miller had been out of school
and working for several years...
...and he had put aside $10,000...
...specifically to invest.
Do you remember?
One of Mr. Miller's good friends
from school...
...was the son of an executive
of the Casio Corporation...
...which at that time
was not doing particularly well.


                                 Page 28/49

Mr. Miller had dinner with this friend...
...at which he was given information...
...which comes along maybe once
every five or six lifetimes.
May we go to 24-2-16, please?
They're gearing up now.
They'll start production in three months.
-Buy as much stock as you can.
-This is fantastic.
Switzerland keeps the time, Charles,
not Japan.
-It'll change.
-I doubt it.
Why not?
Because you need a society
that is into precision.
Japan makes great radios,
but they don't know beans about precision.
You come here and tell me the Germans
are going to start making watches...
...and I'll invest.
What's the present value?
-Six.
-Here's my prediction.
When word hits the street, you're at three.
You watch. Remember who said it.
For the record...
...Casio is one of the largest producers
of time pieces in the universe.
I know who they are.
For the record,
his original investment of $10,000...
...would be worth $37.2 million today.
Wow!
I have nothing further to say.
I'm fine.
You're what?
He's not going to reply.
You aren't responding?
I'd like to hear you speak.
You are good.
Listen, I'm not as smart as everyone here.
Am I defective because
I didn't make money on this?


                                 Page 29/49

I can't believe that the whole point
of the universe is to make money.
I can't believe that.
This has nothing to do with making money.
It's a judgment you made.
Nobody dragged you from home,

saying:
You chose to do that.
You sought the investment.
We're just looking at that choice.
What did you finally invest in?
Do you remember?
I think it was cattle.
Cattle.
What happened?
I never got a straight answer.
All I know is, their teeth fell out.
I rest.
Mr. Stanley, you're up.
No counter at this time.
Wait a second.
You're not showing something in my favor?
Not at this time.
I think it's better to move on.
-Shall we move on?
-Sure, let's move on.
Your Honors, I would like to go to 29-4-5.
This is the evening
before Mr. Miller took the advertising job...
...he was to hold until his passing.
He asked his wife to help him
by playing a little game.
Remember?
You asked her to act the boss...
...so you could practice
getting what you wanted.
-Do this for me. It helps.
-I'm eating.
Do it.
-What do you want me to do?
-Be him.
-This is silly.
-It's not. It helps me.


                                 Page 30/49

Offer me $55,000. No more.
-How much do you want?
-What's the offer?
$55,000.
I can't work here for less than $65,000.
I can't pay you $65,000.
Then I can't work here.
$58,000.
$65,000.
$59,000.
$65,000.
-$60,000?
-$65,000.
$61,000.
Listen.
I cannot take the job for under $65,000,
under no conditions.
I would like to go to the next afternoon
and show you the real encounter.
-I'm prepared to offer you $49,000.
-I'll take it.
I'll get you a parking place.
I'm curious why you caved in so fast.
Why did you accept less money
and do it so quickly?
Here we go again.
Obviously, this is all about money.
I'm guilty.
I didn't make enough money, okay?
Call me a ""hippie,"" send me to hell.
You keep thinking it's about money,
but it's about fear.
Why didn't you stand up to your boss
the way you did to your wife?
First, it wasn't my wife.
It was a man in a suit.
The suit had an odor
and the odor said $49,000.
I like that very much.
Your nostrils said you were worth less,
is that right?
The process of accepting a salary
is a complicated one.
You don't know all my reasons.


                                 Page 31/49

We lived fine on that money.
That money was fine.
If you want to make it about money,
you may. But we're looking at fear.
-What was I afraid of?
-You tell me!
$49,000 is a lot of money!
I have nothing more to say.
Mr. Stanley?
I'm fine.
I can't believe it.
You didn't want to toot your own horn.
Would you like to show something?
I got a raise six months later.
Let us know if you want to show us.
Your Honors, I'd like to present
a compilation of general misjudgments...
...half of them fear-based, half just stupid.
I have assembled 164 misjudgments
over a 12-year period.
Congratulations.
This is so wonderful.
I am looking forward to tomorrow.
I missed you.
Meet Sam.
-Julia told me about you.
-Really?
She doesn't know me.
She could have fooled me.
I heard you had Dick Stanley today.
How'd you know?
Sam uses 54 percent of his brain.
Stanley is a good man.
Quiet, but excellent.
Very quiet.
Julia, see you tomorrow.
Thank you.
We have to go to the Past Lives Pavilion.
Everybody talks about it.
-Don't you want to see who you were?
-Some people don't like it.
You'll love it. They have great hot dogs.
The best hot dogs in town
are by the Hall of Records.


                                 Page 32/49

You sure love this eating thing.
To be able to eat all you want,
never gain weight and feel great. Please.
Look at this!
Let's get in line.
Reminds me of Disneyland.
Hope we're tall enough.
On Earth, did you ever feel like
you might have been other people?
-Ever see yourself in a past life?
-Never. You did?
I think so. I think I might have been
a heavyset man once.
Really? I doubt that.
You never saw yourself as anything?
Once I got stoned
and stared into a mirror for two hours...
...until I saw someone who looked Chinese.
But I think it was just me squinting.
Please take the first available booth
on the left.
The show will begin in 30 seconds.
Welcome to the Past Lives Pavilion.
In a moment, you will be asked to place
your right hand on the plate next to you.
An image of yourself in a former life
will soon appear.
When you have seen enough,
take your hand off the plate.
In order to accommodate everyone...
...you will be limited...
...to five past lives only.
Thank you.
Place hand on plate.
What the hell is this?
Elizabeth! Time for supper, darling.
Be there in a moment, Mumsy.
What the hell's going on here?
Come on, then! To the castle!
That's incredible!
Who are you?
I'm Prince Valiant!
Really?
-Who are you?


                                 Page 33/49

-Dinner.
I was a prince, I was a whaler,
I was a tailor!
God. It was so incredible!
You were a native?
And a dressmaker. That's all I saw.
That's so weird. You were a dressmaker,
I was a tailor. Interesting. Want some?
You're going to eat the stick, too?
I can't get you out of my mind.
Tell me about it.
The screenings are so tough...
...but when I see you, I instantly feel okay.
That's great, right?
I don't think it has anything to do with me.
It worries me.
You're doing it.
What? What am I doing?
I'm not sure.
But I read that you had to be okay
with yourself...
...before you were okay
with another person.
I feel okay with you.
But I don't know how okay I was
with myself before I met you.
So maybe you're making me okay.
You're not that okay.
I'm okay.
What's the score?
You're losing.
We're tied.
Beauty.
You know,
you never told me how you died.
I don't want to talk about it.
Why?
It's embarrassing.
What could be embarrassing?
I was hit by a bus.
I tripped.
Seriously? You tripped?
On what?
We were visiting friends for the weekend.


                                 Page 34/49

Everybody wanted to go into town...
...but I wanted to stay and go swimming.
So I went outside...
...tripped over the chair, hit my head
on the cement and rolled into the pool.
What did the East German judge give you?
Seriously, did you feel anything?
Were you unconscious? Scared?
I was pissed.
You died pissed.
I'm still pissed. I was a good swimmer.
Swimming is only part of it.
You must negotiate the furniture.
In the Olympics,
they're taking that part very seriously.
The Romanians are great at it.
If you make fun of me, I'll get you.
You've already got me.
-What time do you start?
-Early.

I start at 3:
Want to have dinner tomorrow?
I thought I'd start dating others now.
I have my eye on this 91-year-old.
I'll be at the entrance at 5:00.
I'll be there.
If you finish early, come
to my screening room and see my life.
I'd like that.
-Good night.
-Good night.
You'll sleep great.
I have three boxes of candy waiting for me.
Did they give you those chocolate swans?
They're cream-filled.
They're really delicious.
Swans.
I think I'm just getting breath mints.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
After you.
Thank you.
Now I have no attorney.


                                 Page 35/49

That's a very, very nice outfit.
Do you like it here?
I'll make you a promise.
When we're through, if you still want
to know about me, I'll tell you.
But right now, let's concentrate on you.
-Well, look who's here.
-Good morning. I missed you.
-How are you, buddy?
-What do you care?
Stop it.
You think I let you down, don't you?
Where were you? I'm just curious.
You wouldn't understand.
Don't treat me like a moron. Try me.
I was trapped
near the inner circle of thought.
-I don't understand.
-I told you.
Hi. How are you?
Good morning, everybody.
Let's begin. Miss Foster, you're up.
Thank you, Your Honors.
This morning...
...l would like to begin
in the 34th year of life.
Mr. Miller had a speaking engagement...
...to represent all of the West Coast
advertising agencies.
He was to give a very important speech
to the Ford Motor Company.
If he did well, it could have worked
wonders for his career.
Don't make this the end of the world.
May we go to 34-7-7, please?
It's packed like sardines. You ready?
I can't do it. There are too many people.
I can't go out there.
You've got to.
Something has happened to me.
This is way too many people.
I'm having horrible stage fright.
You got to. People are counting on you.
-I'll make a fool of myself.


                                 Page 36/49

-No, you're not.
I can't do it. My heart is racing.
I am having some sort of an anxiety attack.
You know this stuff.
I can't think straight.
Listen to me, that's too many people.
I don't want to go out there.
You have to cancel this.
You're on.
Give us a second.
You've got a full house.
It's packed. Let's go!
-You'll be fine.
-Don't make me do this.
Please welcome our speaker
from Foote, Cone & Belding, Daniel Miller.
I'll be right here if you need me.
Your attention, please.
Nothing serious.
We have a gas leak under this room.
We'd like you all to file out.
Be orderly. This is only a precaution.
I would have shown this day
to illustrate just how brave Mr. Miller is.
With all the pain,
panic and confusion in his mind...
...he still walked to the microphone.
He never said anything!
There was a gas leak!
But he never went back
and accomplished it.
He never got up in front
of a large audience again.
Maybe he didn't want to.
Mr. Miller accepted that engagement
with a great deal of excitement.
He wanted to be there.
If he had accomplished that moment...
...l'm positive his life would have gone
in a much better direction.
You're positive! She's wonderful!
""His life would have gone in a much
better direction.""
Just incredible!


                                 Page 37/49

I'd like to move on to something
I think we'll have a ball watching.
This is damned exciting stuff.
Daniel, where did this scene take place?
What are you showing?
I'm sorry. We're going down to 31-1-9.
The snowmobile.
Big Bear.
Big Bear.
Watch this, Your Honors.
Just dynamite.
""Where the buffalo roam
""And the skies are all cloudy all--""
Oh, my God!
How far did you have to go for help?
About three miles.
You broke your leg in two places?
-Yes, I did.
-I'm proud of you.
With no help, by himself, with as badly
a broken leg as I've ever seen...
...this man crawled three miles to get help.
You're kidding.
What have we just watched?
That is self-preservation.
He didn't risk his life, he saved his life.
You're not a hero if you save your own life?
A hero? No, you're not.
No one here is accusing Mr. Miller
of not having a survival instinct.
We're here to see if he can overcome fear,
not pain.
You don't see fear in this?
Fear of what?
How about death for starters?
I hope you realize it would be very hard
to be a brilliant public speaker...
...if you're lying dead in the snow.
For the record...
...you never rode a snowmobile again.
Hold on. Not because I was afraid.
Because I hated it.
You must believe me.
This is not about fear. This is hate.


                                 Page 38/49

This is a rotten contraption.
It heats up like a toaster oven.
I burned the hair off my thigh
from my knee to my crotch!
Singed it right off. I don't know...
...if the seat was leather or lined with fur...
...but years of rotting,
drying out and getting wet...
Mine smelled like an old sheepdog.
Also, it's very, very noisy.
You don't find that out until the
second hour when you can't hear anyone.
You get off and your friends
are in a silent movie.
Pardon me, but your balls vibrate
for three weeks afterwards.
I'm very proud of you. Very good day.
Very emotional day.
-What are you doing tonight?
-I'm seeing this woman.
-Julia?
-How'd you know her name?
Still don't get the big brain bit?
I'll see you tomorrow.
You did very well. See you.
Here it comes again.
Look at her go!
Going back for the cat is wonderful.
What kind of cat was it?
Persian.
I love Persian.
Sorry, but I just had to see it again.
That's all right. It was spectacular.
That's all for now. We'll meet once more.
For enjoyment's sake.
Let's make it at 1:00.
Daniel, nice to see you. How are you?
You have a good time tonight.
I'll see you tomorrow at 1:00.
Sam told me
about an amazing ltalian restaurant.
Exciting. It was like watching
a Mutual of Omaha commercial.
You're jealous.


                                 Page 39/49

You'll never know how much.
-Those portions are gigantic!
-I'm so hungry.
The residents love this place.
It has the best resident food in the area.
Good clumps?
Enjoy your meal.
What was your favorite food?
Turkey with stuffing.
-I couldn't eat turkey.
-Why not?
When I was a kid,
I had one as a pet and I named it.
You can't eat something you name.
I wish I'd known that.
I would have named ice cream.
Do you eat meat?
Sometimes. How about you?
-I like fish.
-Me, too. What kind?
Salmon.
And I like the kind that live
near the nuclear reactors.
-I forget their name.
-Glow fish?
They light up your house
when you cook them.
-How was your screening?
-Very, very good.
Some fine wine for yourselves?
-What's your name?
-Eduardo.
-How are you, sir?
-I'm fine.
You're going to eat a lot with us tonight?
What do you recommend?
You like pasta?
I'll bring you three pounds of it.
Best you've ever tasted.
You'll love it. What about you,
my friend? Do you like shrimp?
They're so fresh, they'll crawl up
onto the plate themselves.
Aren't they high in cholesterol?


                                 Page 40/49

I don't know what you're talking about,
but don't worry.
I'll be right back.
Is there a Jacuzzi in your room?
In yours?
Not in my room.
It's in the bathroom.
It may not even be a Jacuzzi.
I think it's just holes in the tub.
You don't have to protect my feelings.
If you have a Jacuzzi, I'm happy.
Okay, I do. I use it every night.
It's just wonderful.
I'm happy for you.
-I love it.
-A lot of bubbles?
Here we are. You're going to love this.
And you will love this.
There's 30 shrimp...
...and 30 more where that came from.
This looks delicious.
Broccoli?
With lots of cheese?
That's my girl. What about you?
Maybe just a touch.
You got it.
That's fine.
How many days you looking at?
Nine.
You like pie?
I love pie.
I like you.
I'll bring you nine pies to take with you.
A pie for every day.
I don't want any pies.
It's my pleasure. They'll keep.
Don't. Really.
Don't bring me anything.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
It's unbelievable.
My prosecutor just sat down.
Look. Don't look!
I can't eat here.


                                 Page 41/49

What? You're just eating dinner.
I'm eating 30 shrimp. I'm a pig.
Everyone eats like that here.
Yes, but everyone doesn't have
her watching.
She'll have a tiny resident portion
and I'm eating a fishing boat.
Let's leave.
You're silly. You're just eating.
You're right.
When will that end?
We're having fun. That's important.
See? This woman's looking at that.
This is causing me trouble.
Don't look! Back.
Okay. Suck that up.
It's long.
Bite down now, please. Please bite.
Bite.
Done.
She makes me nervous.
I'm going to the ladies' room.
I pray to God when I get back...
...you've changed.
You're Daniel's prosecutor.
I want you to know he's wonderful.
You are?
Julia.
Pretty name.
-Nice to meet you.
-What did I say?
So you don't forget, I bring these.
You've got nine pies in here.
-Will that be enough for you?
-I didn't want these.
You told me to make them.
I did not.
-You said that.
-No.
Yes, you did.
I have no place for these boxes.
You're embarrassing me.
You're shy.
I'll bring you some steaks.


                                 Page 42/49

No steaks!
Did Sam say what would happen to you?
He said I wouldn't come back
to the hotel after tomorrow.
That's all I know.
I must tell you something.
-I know you think I've got it together.
-You do.
No, not quite.
But one thing I do know how to do
is make things work.
I can take a situation
and just make it okay.
I've always been able to do that.
But it's work.
And this...
...this isn't.
I don't know what this is...
...but it's--
Effortless.
I've never, ever had that before.
Tell me about it.
I didn't think it would happen to me.
Where do we find it? ln the pit stop.
Thanks, God.
-Better this than nothing.
-I guess.
Want to spend the night with me?
More than anything in the world.
Good. Come on, let's go.
I don't think I can. I don't think I should.
Why?
Because.
This is already better
than any sex I've ever had. Ever.
I don't want to screw it up. Literally.
-How do you know what will happen?
-I don't.
Let's say it's the most amazing thing ever.
Then what will I do?
I doubt we're going to the same place.
So, I'll just have to miss it
forever and ever?
And what if it's not so good?


                                 Page 43/49

I won't be able to fantasize about it.
I love you.
If I had a fire scene like you,
I would feel differently.
I'd stay here. I'd never leave.
But I've been defending myself so hard...
...and I don't want to be judged anymore.
I have this wonderful feeling inside of me,
but I'm...
I'm just tired of being judged.
It's okay.
-I'll miss you.
-I'll miss you so much.
I love you, Daniel.
I'll miss you.
I should go.
Can you get me the Majestic Hotel?
Yes, Julia.
My God, I don't know her last name!
Excuse me?
I am in love with a woman in your hotel
and I don't know her last name.
What's her first name?
We have two Julias.
Both have ""Do Not Disturb"" signs on.
Can you ring through? It's important.
I'm not allowed to do that.
But it's very important.
I'm sorry.
Can I leave a message then?
For both of them.
Go ahead, sir.
Tell them both that...
...l love them more than life itself.
I've never met anybody like them...
...and I'll miss them forever and ever.
Is that all, sir?
That's all.
Has Mr. Miller overcome his fears,
Your Honors?
I believe my final summation scene...
...will prove to you that he has.
Your middle-thirties were not very good
for you, were they?


                                 Page 44/49

A bad divorce left you
with virtually nothing financially.
You had about $9,000 to your name,
correct?
Months before your divorce...
...you and your wife purchased tickets
to Hong Kong.
You were going to go together...
...but after the separation,
she cashed hers in.
What did you do with yours?
I used it.
He used it.
With only $9,000 to his name...
...with his life in a rut,
he didn't do the safe thing.
He could have cashed in his ticket.
But he said,
""To hell with it, I'm going to Hong Kong.""
That alone, in my book, takes a lot of guts.
But, Your Honors, it just begins there.
Let us go to 36-9-16.
Los Angeles lnternational Airport.
You're in seat 41 B.
Between A and C.
Yes, it is.
I'm sitting between people
all the way to Asia?
Yes, you are.
Is coach completely full?
Oh, yes.
Any space left in first class?
There's one seat left.
-What's the price difference?
-Round-trip?
It's an additional $3,194.
I'll take it.
This man just spent one-third...
...of his entire life savings
to be more comfortable.
What does that say?
As stressed out and crazy
as his life was at that moment...
...the little boy inside him cried out:


                                 Page 45/49

""I need this. Don't worry about money.
We'll get it back. Be nice to me.""
And he was.
I feel Mr. Miller is sufficiently past
the fears...
...that would keep him from being
a remarkable citizen of the Universe.
I wholeheartedly recommend
full onward movement.
I rest.
Miss Foster, you're up.
At this point, I would like to show
my final summation scene.
Proceed.
My scene takes place not there, but here.
We're showing something from here?
Yes, we are.
I was told we're not doing that anymore.
No one told you that.
What are we seeing?
Something from last night.
Please watch this
and tell me what you were feeling.
Want to spend the night with me?
More than anything in the world.
I don't think I can.
I don't think I should.
Why?
If I had a fire scene like you,
I'd feel differently.
I'd stay here. I'd never leave.
But I've been defending myself so hard...
...and I don't want to be judged anymore.
I have this wonderful feeling inside of me,
but I'm...
I'm just tired of being judged.
You genuinely feel for this woman,
don't you?
Why didn't you stay with her?
I was afraid.
Louder.
I was afraid.
I rest.
This is a new one on me.


                                 Page 46/49

Sex with somebody and move right on.
Is that how it works, Miss Foster?
You're not very understanding
about the world Mr. Miller came from.
It's filled with problems
you no longer have:
Deadly diseases,
confusing identities, changing attitudes.
Perhaps he was worried
about getting a disease.
Were you worried about getting a disease?
I didn't think she had a disease. No.
But you didn't know.
We're getting off the point.
We've never been near the point!
You're getting him both ways!
When he's brave and then does something
you don't like, you show the follow-up.
Or you blame him for not having any.
This is an example of something
he wanted to do. And he didn't...
...because he was afraid.
This was just last night.
You know what I think we just watched?
I think we just watched a man who was
caring of another human being's feelings.
He didn't know what this experience
would do to her, so he was careful.
But you blame him for it.
I praise him for it.
You call it ""fear."" I call it ""thoughtfulness.""
To be caring about someone else's feelings.
I'm sorry,
but I hope we all can have that quality.
Your final summation, please.
I think it was thoughtfulness.
I'd like to say something
about this disease.
Your Honors,
I didn't think Julia had a disease.
But right now on Earth...
...they're filling our heads
with these terrible things.
They tell you over and over


                                 Page 47/49

you're not sleeping with one person.
You're sleeping with everyone
they've ever slept with.
Now that I've been
to the Past Lives Pavilion...
...that could be 20 to 30,000 people.
As far as my life is concerned,
I truly believe I turned the corner.
I know I had a few fears left,
but I was taken very young.
I could've conquered them.
If you see fit to let me move forward...
...l promise you, I will do the best I can.
I will work very hard,
I'll do whatever is asked.
I'll do the best I can.
Honestly. I will.
I'll do the best I can.
Is that all?
Please just know that I'll--
Do the best you can?
Good.
That's all.
It was nice to meet you. Good luck.
That's it.
Let's go back to my office.
We'll know in 30 minutes.
Judgment's in.
It's early.
-Is that good?
-It's not good or bad.
They don't waste any time.
They must need the hotel space.
How do you like our city?
We do a pretty good job here.
How was the ltalian restaurant?
What does it say?
You're going back.
Can I say something?
Because they're sending you back
doesn't mean they're right.
They can make mistakes.
Don't let others get to you.
Just follow what's in here.


                                 Page 48/49

Come on. I'll take you to the station.
Trams 7 and 8 to onward destinations...
I'll never get over it.
The organization is amazing.
All these different trams going everywhere.
These are yours.
Your boarding card, various ID.
The things you'll need.
You won't remember any of this,
so you won't kick yourself forever.
Just take the opportunities
when they come, okay?
Passengers going back to Earth,
please board trams on your left.
Those moving onward,
board trams to the right.
This is it.
Good luck. I've got a lot of faith in you.
I can take that here.
Keep those and follow the yellow line.
All trams now operational.
Trams 7 and 8 to onward destinations...
...final boarding please.
Here, sir.
All personnel, please prepare for departure.
Daniel!
Julia!
What are you doing?
Sit down! You'll hurt yourself!
I love you.
I called, but I didn't know your last name.
I won't let you go.
I won't let you go.
Help! Help!
Hold on! Just please, hold on!
I love you.
I love you.
Open this up!
Damn it, open it!
Please open the door!
Julia! Wait for me!
Brave enough for you?
Open the door! Please!
Let him go.

Definitely, Maybe
      By Adam Brooks




         Page 1/60

Can I get you
to sign right here, please?
Okay. Here you go.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Hi, Will. Package for you.
I don't think anyone ever imagines
on their wedding day
they'll be part of the 46%
that doesn't live happily ever after.
Will?
Just heard we got the Quaker Oats account.
Way to go.
You must be completely psyched.
Then again,
I never thought I'd spend my days,
weeks and years working
in an advertising agency
trying to figure out how to get kids to eat
Cap'n Crunch instead of Froot Loops.
But Tuesdays and Fridays
are my favorite days.
I get out of work early, and I go pick up
my daughter, Maya, from school.
Now, it's a great feeling when you find
the right track to go with the day.
And today, I have found
the absolute perfect song.
Bitches, they can kiss my...
The other perfect song.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
But sometimes, no matter
how carefully you plan your playlist,
there is no right track for what awaits you.
- Come on, come on!
- Hey, what's going on?
Will, did you know there was gonna be
a sex ed class today?
Aren't they kind of young?
- Yeah! It was a total disaster.
- At least it got them reading.
There's a book!
""The 250 million sperm are ejaculated


                                 Page 2/60

""and begin their treacherous journey
towards the fallopian tubes!
""One hundred million are wiped
out instantly...""
I'm gonna find Maya.
Do you still have sex with Daddy?
- What are you talking about?
- Do you?
- You know, we will go home and talk...
- You do, don't you?
- We will go home and talk about this.
- I hate you, I hate you!
Stop pulling on me! I am trying
to get to the bottom of something!
We need to talk.
Which is when the man
removes his penis from his pajamas
and thrusts it into a woman's vagina...
Okay, but Mrs. Gallagher
didn't actually say ""thrust.""
- Yeah.
- Oh.
But what I don't understand,
Sammy Boigon's sister said
he was an accident.
I mean, how do you accidentally
thrust a penis into... Hi, Luis.
- Hey.
- How do you accidentally...
Stop saying ""penis"" and ""thrust.""
Just say ""tinkle part"" or ""wee-wee.""
Something cute.
- Explain how Sammy was an accident.
- That's complicated.
- Penis! Penis.
- Okay. All right, that's enough.
Okay, they...
It's not like his dad slipped
on a banana peel.
The accident was that Sammy's mom
got pregnant.
If they didn't want a baby,
then how come they had sex?
That's a very good question.


                                 Page 3/60

I guess you could say
that they were rehearsing.
- Was I an accident?
- No.
- I was, wasn't I?
- No.
You were completely and totally on purpose.
I knew exactly what I was getting into.
I think you should tell me
the story of you and my mom.
Why do you keep saying ""my mom""
like I've never met her?
Well, because now that
you're getting divorced,
she's mine, not yours.
- Is that so?
- Tell me how it happened.
And the real story, not the,
""Oh, we met, we fell in love,
""and we decided to take all that love
""and make a family,
and that's how we made you.""
You know something?
I'm gonna tell you the real, true story
of how me and your mother met.
- When I'm old enough.
- Yep.
- Look. I know love isn't a fairytale.
- Really?
Really.
Did you have another girlfriend
before you met her?
Come on, tell me the truth.
I had two serious girlfriends.
And then some other,
a smattering of other women that I dated.
You know.
What?
What's the boy word for slut?
They still haven't come up with one yet,
but I'm sure they're working on it.
You a vegetarian this week or not?
- Yeah, I am.
- Great.


                                 Page 4/60

I'm guessing
you weren't her first boyfriend.
Maybe it was some nerdy guy,
or maybe he was mean.
Or maybe
you were friends for the longest time,
and then just when you were
about to put your penis
into somebody else's vagina...
Okay. Good night, Maya.
...you realized Mom
was the only one for you!
Bedtime!
You still have to tell me
the story of why you fell in love with her.
I fell in love with her because
she was smart and beautiful and fun.
So now she's stupid and ugly and boring?
- Of course not.
- Then what's the problem?
- It's complicated, Maya.
- Everything with you is so complicated.
I bet that if you just told me the story,
you'd realize that it's not complicated at all.
That you just love her.
I know this is tough for you,
but what are you thinking?
That I'm gonna tell you this story
and it's gonna make everything better?
It doesn't work that way.
Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
Tell me and we'll find out.
No. Game over. It's time for bed.
No, it's not time for bed!
It's time for you to tell me the story!
- Maya.
- I need to know!
I need to know.
Fine! Fine!
I'm gonna tell you the story,
- but I'm not telling you who your mom is.
- Fine.
You're just gonna have
to figure it out for yourself.


                                 Page 5/60

- Good.
- And I'm changing all the names
and some of the facts,
but I just decided that right now.
- And then we'll see how smart you are.
- I like it. It's like a love story/mystery.
- Great. Sounds good. You ready?
- No.
No.
- Take your time.
- I will.
- I know you will.
- You go here.
- Princess pillow?
- Thank you.
- You bet.
- Okay.
I'm ready.
Once upon a time,
before e-mails and cell phones
and reality television shows,
in 1992 to be exact,
in a little town called Madison, Wisconsin,
there lived a young man
named William Hayes.
- Hey, Will, man, Happy New Year.
- Hey, yeah, you, too.
Now, this young man was deeply,
deeply in love with his college sweetheart.
Let's call her...
- Emily!
- Emily!
Emily!
- Hey.
- Hi.
Ten, nine, eight...
Hey, guess who's gonna be the luckiest guy
on planet Earth in about four seconds?
You.
two, one!
Happy New Year!
They were a perfect couple.
Except to really understand
how this young man


                                 Page 6/60

ended up marrying your mother,
you'll also need to know
that he had a very big,
incredibly embarrassing dream.
All rise
for the President
of the United States of America,
William
Matthew
Hayes.
You wanted to be President?
I'm just, I don't understand why you have
to work for Clinton in New York.
Why can't you just work for him in Madison?
Well, because they don't need me here.
They need me in New York.
They need him, Em. Will's the man.
I can't believe you're letting him go.
I mean, don't you know
about New York girls?
Besides being incredibly hot,
they have no problem with casual sex,
which by the way, I totally respect.
- What if Charlie's right?
- Charlie's never right.
- He's functionally retarded.
- I am worried New York's gonna change you.
- Change can be good.
- If we change together.
So, we'll change together.
Okay? It's two months in New York.
I'll be back before you know it.
Besides, we have a plan, right?
The other thing I can't believe is that
you'd risk leaving Emily here with me,
'cause I gotta tell you,
I've always had a thing for you...
And I have absolutely no scruples.
Wait! I almost forgot.
You have to give this to Summer.
She's the only girl I know in New York.
- I want you to meet her.
- Summer Hartley?
- Yes. Yes.


                                 Page 7/60

- That's her name?
She was on my exchange program
at Cambridge,
and all the guys wanted to sleep with her,
and you probably will, too.
Maybe you should mail it to her.
- That might be a better idea.
- No.
What is it?
Something I should have
sent her a long time ago.
I love you, William Hayes.
Okay. Go, go, go. Go be your brilliant self.
Emily sounds like she would
make a good mom.
- I just don't know if she's my mom.
- Why not?
Everyone knows that the girlfriend
in the beginning of the story
always gets dumped.
Which means maybe
Summer Hartley is my mother.
I'll never forget that day.
There I was, arriving in the city
I always dreamed about
to work on a campaign
that I believed in with all of my heart.
And on top of that,
I was positive that in just a few hours,
the campaign manager would realize
how brilliant I was.
And then I'd be writing speeches,
and then I'd be coming up with strategy,
and before long...
Will Hayes?
- Hey. Gareth Henderson.
- You're Gareth.
- Hey, how are you?
- Nice to meet you. We're walking, Hayes.
I brought my C.V. and a sample of some
speeches I wrote for Congressman Sweeney.
Fantastic. I cannot wait to peruse these
in my abundant spare time.
In the meantime, here's a sample


                                 Page 8/60

of the coffee and bagel order
I'll need filled immediately.
Wait!
You want me to get coffee?
At some point in our lives, we all get coffee.
Your time's now. Come on.
We're still walking, Hayes.
Have the coffee here by 10:00,
or Arthur's gonna kill me!
That means I'm gonna have to kill you.
I've killed before, Hayes.
- You should know that.
- What is this?
That is a cellular telephone
so I can get a hold of you wherever,
whenever, for whatever.
- Can somebody get me an aspirin, please?
- Watch it!
Glad to have you aboard, Hayes!
- Hi.
- What? Hi.
Four weeks from now,
voters of New York State
will select their next Democratic nominee
for President.
Now, if Bill Clinton wins,
I want you to all understand
that it's gonna be as a direct result
of the commitment and the energy
of every person in this room.
And I mean that. That's just a fact.
Now, that's how important the work is.
That each and every one of you is...
What am I doing here?
It's the new guy.
- Hey.
- Hey, is that the toilet paper guy?
- Can I get a pack of Morley Red, please?
- 3.25.
in Madison, Wisconsin.
So go back to Madison.
- Don't forget to write.
- That's right. Don't forget to write.
Hold it! Stop. Stop right there!


                                 Page 9/60

You smoked?
No. Yeah.
But I didn't mean to tell you that.
Listen. I was young, and I was stupid,
and I haven't smoked in years.
I promise you.
Is there anything else you should tell me?
Probably not.
- Can I get 10 copies?
- Put them on the pile.
No, they're for Arthur.
I need them like, 15 minutes ago.
So if you wouldn't mind...
You're the toilet paper guy.
Wait. Who's that?
- That's April.
Yes. I am, in fact, the toilet paper guy,
but feel free to call me
the bagel-and-coffee guy.
Or Todd in Accounting calls me Crystal,
which I'm pretty sure is a girl's name.
- How many copies?
- Ten. Please.
- These?
- Yeah, both of those.
What made you become
a Bill Clinton supporter?
I'm not. This is a money gig.
I get paid 12 an hour,
which is better than babysitting, which is
what I've been doing way too much of.
You're a Democrat, right?
Why does everyone have to be
a Democrat or a Republican?
I'm struggling with the copy machine.
No, hold on.
You're an Independent, aren't you?
I am nothing.
Why am I obligated to be something?
Why do I have to have an opinion
about everything anyway?
I mean, really,
what do I know about missile systems
or Social Security, or the tax code?


                                 Page 10/60

What about civil rights or women's rights?
A woman's right to do what she wants
with her body? What about that?
I do what I want with my body.
That's apathetic.
- I'm not apathetic.
- Yes, you are.
I'm not. I just know that these bozos
you're working for,
they don't care about anything more
than their own ambitions.
That's absolutely not true.
You think this guy, Bill Clinton,
is gonna make a huge difference?
- I do.
- He's gonna do what's already inevitable.
- Okay, that's where you're wrong.
- Don't make me staple your head!
You're wrong. He's gonna make
a difference with African Americans.
He's gonna make a difference with women.
He gets women.
- My God.
- I mean, look at his record in Arkansas.
Read his plans on health care.
Read his plans on education.
- Okay, or don't. You know, yeah.
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- I just fell asleep.
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah. That's fine.
Wake up to a new America.
- I believe you.
- This has been really interesting.
- Fine. You convinced me. You're nothing.
- I'm nothing.
So I'm here to repeat in front of all of you...
Hey! Listen up! Look up, everybody!
Yes, I was Bill Clinton's lover for 12 years.
Hey, somebody turn it up.
For the past two years, I have lied to the
press about our relationship to protect him.
The truth is, I loved him.


                                 Page 11/60

Now he tells me to deny it.
Well, I'm sick of all of the deceit,
and I'm sick of all of the lies.
Well, you're right about one thing.
He certainly gets women.
- This has been fun. Yeah.
- Bye, toilet paper guy.
Bye, copy girl.
Oh, my God. It never ends.
They just keep playing it
over and over and over again.
It's gonna blow over.
- Right.
People don't really care about this stuff.
- That's the thing.
- What I don't understand,
I've heard Bush has a mistress.
Everybody's talking about it, so why
is it okay for him and not for Clinton?
She's trashy.
I mean, her hair alone
is enough reason to go after Clinton.
Big deal. Everyone has their weaknesses,
you know?
Those chubby redheads
with the long, fake fingernails?
- That's what Daddy likes.
- That's just nasty.
Gareth, you are unfailingly repugnant.
Hey. That is a coincidence. I love women
that say ""unfailingly repugnant.""
You know what I love?
I love long-haired brunettes
with horn-rimmed glasses.
I have no idea why.
They're like kryptonite to me.
I got that one, too.
I got a thing for guys
who've got a thing for me.
You might wanna look at that.
I'm gonna propose a toast.
I am fine with that.
- To Bill and his weaknesses.
- Yes.


                                 Page 12/60

- To Bill.
- To Bill.
Hello?
Hey! It's me!
- Is that Emily?
- Is that Emily?
- Hi, Emily!
- Hi, Emily!
What's all that noise?
Nothing. That's just a couple of idiots
I work with making fun of me
because they don't have a beautiful
girlfriend that they're eternally devoted to!
You're drunk.
You're beautiful.
- You're horny.
- You might be right.
Emily? Come to New York.
You'll love it here.
It's the energy, the people. It's amazing.
Whoa, did you just say ""energy""?
Will, you did not just say ""energy.""
What?
You're never coming back.
Hey, come on, now.
I just want you to come for a weekend.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Did you call Summer?
No. I left her a message.
She didn't get back to me.
Hey. You okay?
Yeah. I'm just really lonely here,
and I miss you like crazy,
and it's really hard.
Yeah. I know what you mean.
- Hey. What are you doing up?
- Mr. McCormack.
Come on, you've been staring
at that package for about a week now.
How was the rest of your evening?
Successful, I take it.
Oh, my goodness. I'm in big trouble.
I love this girl!
You know, that's usually a good thing.


                                 Page 13/60

It's hard enough to get elected
the first black President
without having Julia Roberts
on your arm at the inauguration.
That is an impressive mental leap, Russ,
going from a one-night stand
to being sworn in as President.
Open it.
I know you're dying to know what's inside.
Just her name alone, Summer Hartley,
is driving me...
Look it! You got a tear right there! I see it.
Come on through. You can do it.
Thank you. Yes.
- It's a diary.
- Sweet Jesus. Let me see.
No! Stop! Stop right there.
We're not gonna read this. We can't.
""The boys' dorm is across
the quad, their windows visible from ours.
""The evenings are hot and sticky.
""We are all half-dressed,
pretending we can't be seen by the boys.
""Some of us are bold. My new friend
""Emily is sweet
""and embarrassed by it all,
always waiting to see what I will do.""
Don't stop! This is good stuff.
Where were you? Okay.
""It's our last night, and the plan has
been in place for days.
""Emily and I are the last to leave,
""and as we reach the stairs,
I grab Emily firmly by her wrist.
""She looks up at me expectantly
and I know what will happen next.""
- Do you?
- I think I have a pretty good idea.
Oh, my goodness!
What are you doing?
This is good stuff, man!
Wait a minute.
Is that your Emily?
Good night, Russell!


                                 Page 14/60

She is a freak!
Put the picture back!
Wow.
Who is it?
- Will Hayes. I called earlier.
You a Jehovah's Witness?
No.
Christ, you're tall.
Hi.
- Come in.
- Okay.
Close the door behind you.
Lock it!
Summer said to hang tight.
She'll be back. She wants you to wait.
- What do you got in there?
- I don't know. Are you Summer's father?
Yeah. I'm her daddy.
- Drink?
- No. No. It's a little early for me.
Early. You're fresh off the boat, aren't you?
So tell me about yourself. What's your deal?
What do you aspire to?
What are your dreams?
What are your fancies?
What do you want to be when you grow up?
- Sit down!
- Okay.
What do you do now? You...
Wait, don't tell me.
You work for your daddy.
- No.
- No, don't tell me!
Wall Street. No!
You kiss ass to some fancy uptown law firm.
- Actually...
- No! I give up. What do you do?
I'm working for Bill Clinton.
He's running for President.
No.
I know who Bill Clinton is.
Yeah, in fact, I know more about Bill Clinton
than his own mother.
- Really?


                                 Page 15/60

- Yep.
- What do you do?
- What do I do?
I drink!
Drink!
Be a man.
There you go! Isn't that better?
Swallow!
So tell me about Bill Clinton.
Hey. Wake up.
You want some aspirin?
- You must be Will.
- Hi.
I see you drank my boyfriend
under the table.
He's not your father?
- Is that what he told you?
Hmm.
He's my thesis advisor.
Oh.
What else did he tell you?
He was telling me how to be a real man,
as opposed to the sort of
- boy-man I seem to be.
- Did you learn anything?
Yeah, there's a lot of drinking involved.
Also cursing and fighting.
- Sex?
- Yes.
Although that's not what we real men call it.
What do you call it?
I have something for you.
This is from Emily.
- Haven't talked to her in ages.
- We'll be moving in together in the fall.
Uh-huh.
Oh, please! Daddy.
Oh, come on! No.
Oh, this is...
Did you read this?
I didn't.
- I read a page.
- A page.
- Two pages at the most.


                                 Page 16/60

- Two?
And the part about you and Emily
touching each other and kissing.
- Oh! That part, yeah.
- Incredibly descriptive. I felt like I was there.
You're a great writer. I mean...
I think you should keep it.
You should read it when you're lonely.
- I can't. It's your diary, so I can't do that.
- No, really, really. I just, I don't need it.
I've already got it memorized,
so I'll just leave it on the table.
Keep a hard copy.
That might be nice for me.
I wonder why Emily gave it to you
to give to me.
Hmm.
Hampton?
- Hampton?
- Are you gonna join us?
That's Hampton Roth.
He's an incredible writer.
- His book on the McGovern campaign is...
- Yeah.
- You...
- Yeah. We do.
Look, have you ever actually
had sex with a sexagenarian?
- I haven't.
- Well, then you shouldn't really judge.
Well, actually, I'm not judging. Look at you.
You're beautiful. You're sophisticated.
You're a very talented writer.
Thank you.
I mean, to please a woman like you,
it would obviously take a...
- Real man.
- Exactly.
- Hard to compete with that.
- Well, unless you're the competitive type.
- Yep, nice to meet you.
- Yeah, it was great meeting you, too.
I feel horrible about taking the...
Sorry.


                                 Page 17/60

I was just curious.
Hampton encourages me
to cultivate my curiosity.
He says it's the key
to being a good journalist.
Yeah.
Summer! Daddy's hungry!
- Speak of the devil. Better go. Yeah.
- Hmm.
Where the hell are you?
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.
Yeah, give us a call sometime.
We should all go out for dinner.
I'd... Yeah, I'd love dinner.
- Yeah.
- Hey!
- Are you gonna call her?
- Are you insane?
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- What am I gonna do?
I'm gonna keep my eye on the ball.
Emily and I have a future. We have a plan.
Which may involve
some type of threesome now.
Or foursome
if that old dude is still in the picture.
You're not helping.
I never should have opened that diary.
It's like Pandora's hot, sexy box.
What's a threesome?
- What?
- A threesome.
That's a game that adults play sometimes
when they're bored.
Whatever. So what happened with Emily?
Nothing. I wanted to wait
till she came for a visit,
and then I decided to do
something really dramatic.
It was just one week
before the primary, and I had graduated
from bagels and toilet paper
to signs and bumper stickers.


                                 Page 18/60

Jesus! Mercy!
Hold, please.
What am I doing here?
Move over! Another foot!
Go, another foot. Move over!
Over, over, over!
Just want to let everyone know
that the new signs are ready.
They're looking good.
I wrote three speeches
for Congressman Sweeney.
How's high school?
He's from Texas. His name's George Bush.
But he is not the President.
Instead, he's the eldest son
of George and Barbara
and considered a key
political advisor of the White House.
Bryant, well, you forgot to mention
the Texas Rangers.
Oh, okay.
Man, if this guy's smart,
he'll go back to baseball.
- No kidding.
- Anybody see Hayes?
- No.
- No.
Hayes! Where is Hayes? Hayes!
Is it true you graduated first
of your class at Madison?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Come on. We're walking.
- We're walking.
Here's a list of Madison graduates
in the New York area.
These people earn 200 grand plus a year.
We have a $10,000-a-plate fundraiser
on Monday with 15 empty tables.
I can't have that, Hayes.
I need you to sell five of them.
Hold on. No more coffee, bagels?
- We'll see how this goes, okay?
- Gareth.


                                 Page 19/60

- What?
- Thank you. I'm really happy right now.
- Okay, Hayes.
- Okay.
- There's the desk.
- Look at that. Yeah.
Yeah, that's funny, the toilet paper.
That's good because it's ironic.
Yeah, that's right, everybody. My desk.
Right here, I got a desk, and I got a list.
And I have a phone. And this empty basket.
No, no, no, I really don't agree
that the Governor has a character problem,
Mrs. Perleman.
Did you know that
marijuana use should be legalized?
Hello?
No, no, no, he wasn't a draft dodger.
Besides, did you know that
the majority of Americans believe
that the Vietnam War
was just a terrible idea?
Both legs.
Wow, I am sorry. You must miss them.
Yes, I understand your concern,
but I think you should remember
that the Governor comes from
a town called Hope.
And hope is exactly what he stands for, so...
No, no, I know it's corny, but I also think
that sometimes corny is exactly
what this country needs.
That would be wonderful. No, thank you.
Two seats.
Okay, great. Thank you, Mr. Bishop.
Yeah, the dinner's next Thursday.
Yes, when I spoke with Hillary this morning
she said that she wanted to get to know
our most important supporters.
No, I think you'd definitely
enjoy meeting her.
Yeah.
An entire table? No, that is very possible.
I'll put you down for one table, then.


                                 Page 20/60

That sounds great.
Okay, I look forward
to seeing you next Thursday.
Okay, thank you.
I just sold an entire table for $50,000.
That's my guy, Will. My guy.
Toilet paper guy! Toilet paper guy!
Good evening, gentlemen.
Pack of Reds, please.
Christ.
Tell us the truth, my friend.
- Did that Clinton inhale or not?
- What does it matter?
That's like if your girlfriend catches you
in bed with another woman, then you say,
""But we didn't do it.""
- What, is that gonna matter to her?
- Yeah, it does. Hi.
- Hello.
- Pack of American Eagles, blue, please.
for a pack of cigarettes?
They don't put as many chemicals in them.
- So those are healthy cigarettes.
- Something like that.
So if there's not as many chemicals in them,
they should cost less, not more,
don't you think?
They put saltpeter in your cigarettes,
which make them burn faster,
which make you smoke more.
Which means, at the end of the day,
your cigarettes actually cost more, not less.
Copy girl,
what I think you're actually paying for
is the picture of the eagle
and the pretty pastel colors.
Some reassuring idea about your lifestyle.
The rest is pretty much crap.
- You wanna bet?
- Sure.
- 20 bucks.
- I got 20 bucks.
Easiest 20 bucks I ever made.
- Really?


                                 Page 21/60

- Yeah.
That's funny.
In a minute, I'll have 40.
Okay, we have to inhale at the same time
for the same amount of time.
- Yep.
- Ready, steady, go.
- It's my birthday today.
- Happy birthday.
Why aren't you out celebrating?
My boyfriend, Lucas, was taking me out
for dinner and then to a party.
But at last minute, he gets a gig in Philly,
which, of course, he takes 'cause...
Truth is he's far more interested in being
the next Kurt Cobain
than being my boyfriend.
Who's Kurt Cobain?
You're kidding me!
What?
Smoke.
Oh.
- Look at that.
- Look at that.
- All right.
- No, come on.
The satisfaction of me being right
and you being wrong
is more than enough for me.
Well, I never welsh on a bet,
so I'll tell you what.
I'll take you out for dinner,
for a birthday dinner.
- What do you say?
- Like a date?
No, I didn't mean it like that.
Like an ""I feel sorry for you
""because it's your birthday
and you have no plans"" dinner.
- You know, one of those.
- Well, I'll tell you what.
You can take me to this party
I have to go to,
because there's no way


                                 Page 22/60

I can face going alone.
Yeah, I'm gonna go head over...
Whoa.
I think I'm a little out of my league here.
Yes, you are.
So Emily is what, like,
your college sweetheart?
- It's amazing how you do that.
- What?
The way you take the simplest statement,
and then you twist it with
a completely negative connotation.
- It's really, actually, impressive. I'm amazed.
- I didn't mean to do that.
- But I understand. I get it.
- I actually think it's very sweet.
- See, you did it again.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- I don't even know I'm doing it.
It's probably hard for you to imagine
a relationship based on mutual respect
without even the slightest hint of
whatever you call it, masochism.
Well, if your deal with Emily
is so gosh darn wonderful,
then why don't you just marry her?
What's stopping you?
Nothing.
- Wow.
- Wow.
She gets it tomorrow. I made a reservation
at some fancy French restaurant
on the Upper East Side.
Oh, my God. You're doing it
in front of a room full of strangers?
- Yeah, I am. What's wrong with that?
- No, nothing. I think it shows confidence.
What are you gonna say?
- I'm still working on it. I don't know.
- Oh, you should work on it with me.
You should practice with me.
I'm really good at that. I will be Emily.
I'm Emily, your college sweetheart.


                                 Page 23/60

Is there something you wanted to ask me?
- Emily...
- Wait! You've got to get down on your knee.
No, I'm not getting down on my knee.
She'll like it.
She'll like seeing you down on your knee.
- I'm not getting down on my knee.
- Such a mistake. Okay.
- Emily.
- Yes, William.
Don't make me laugh. Emily,
will you,
um,
marry me?
- No.
- Oh, my God.
Well, what do you mean,
""Will you, um, marry me?""
I haven't seen you in weeks!
You don't look happy or excited
about the prospect of our marriage!
You're asking me to give up my freedom,
my joie de vivre
for an institution that fails
as often as it succeeds?
And why should I marry you, anyway?
I mean, why do you wanna marry me?
Besides some bourgeois desire to fulfill
an ideal that society embeds in us
from an early age to promote
a consumer capitalist agenda?
Oh!
Oh, my God!
- You should've got on your knee!
- Just shut up!
Here.
I wanna marry you
because you're the first person
that I want to look at
when I wake up in the morning
and the only one I wanna kiss goodnight.
Because the first time
that I saw these hands,
I couldn't imagine


                                 Page 24/60

not being able to hold them.
But mainly, when you love someone
as much as I love you
getting married is the only thing left to do.
So will you...
Um...
marry me?
Definitely. Maybe.
I have to think about it.
Walk me home?
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- Yeah. I'd love one.
Hey.
How come you have so many copies
of Jane Eyre?
- It's a long story.
- Really?
It seems to be about 300 pages or so.
Seriously, why?
For my 13th birthday,
I wanted a pair of gold stud earrings,
and instead my dad bought me
a hardcover copy of Jane Eyre.
And inside, he wrote a beautiful inscription,
which I could care less about at the time
seeing as I was so pissed
about the earrings,
which was tragic as it turned out 'cause
it was the last present he ever gave me.
What do you mean?
He died three weeks later in a car accident.
Jesus. That's awful.
I'm sorry.
- Have you ever read it?
- No.
I read it every year or two.
Each time it's different.
It tells me different things.
Anyhow, when I went away to college,
my mom sold our house
and somewhere along the way,
Jane Eyre got lost.
Now, every time I pass
a second-hand bookstore,


                                 Page 25/60

I look for the copy that my dad
bought me for my birthday.
I know I'll never find it.
It's stupid, but it's become this,
like, weird superstitious little...
- It's not stupid.
- Thanks. Hobby.
What are all these?
Oh, these are the ones
I found that have inscriptions.
""With love and hopes and dreams
of second chances. Alice.""
What is this?
This is Kurt Cobain.
This is Nirvana. Do you like it?
Yeah, I do.
You think it's ridiculous
that I want to be a politician, don't you?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
No, no, I get the whole politician thing.
It's easy to like you.
That's true. That's very true.
I just wonder if you want people
to like you a little too much.
That's also true.
I should want them to hate me.
I'm gonna start working on that right away.
You got any tips for me?
No, but you're off to a great start.
- Yeah?
- I'm hating you already.
Good.
What do you wanna be when you grow up?
I mean, you're too smart
to be making Xeroxes
- and babysitting.
- No.
- I don't know!
- Whatever else you do.
I don't know,
and I don't know how to know. You know?
You know what I really wanna do
is I wanna go to all those places


                                 Page 26/60

that I know nothing about.
I've been saving money.
But I can't even get it together to do that.
Probably because I'm stuck in a rut
with this guy.
You should dump him.
I know that's none of my business,
but you're too good for him.
You are.
- You know what's really cool?
- I don't.
We can just sit here
and we don't have to worry about
- flirting or all the attraction stuff.
- All that stuff.
Very cool.
Yeah.
I got to go.
Dumbass!
- Oh, God.
- There he is!
- Told you he wouldn't be long.
- Hi! I wanted to surprise you!
- I took the red-eye!
- That's incredible!
I was just telling Emily how Arthur sent you
to Albany as part of the advance team.
- Advance team.
- Yeah. How'd it go?
- How'd it go? Man, it went great!
- Great.
- Great.
- Great.
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I was just getting a little exercise.
- I ran up the stairs.
- Okay.
I'm going to the office. It's...
Got a big day. Nice meeting you.
- And you.
- Okay.
Okay.
Good luck.
- Hi.


                                 Page 27/60

- Hi.
- Here.
- Yeah.
Hey.
- It's weird. Your tongue tastes different.
- What?
It tastes different, your tongue.
- That is weird.
- It's not bad. It's just different.
Maybe it's the tap water here.
Or the pH balance...
I don't know what I'm talking about.
Told you New York was gonna change you.
- Could we maybe go for a walk?
- Yeah.
- Just to get some air?
- Yeah, you could see New York.
I would love that.
So, did I ever tell you...
- I was gonna...
- Oh, sorry. No, go.
- What?
I was gonna say, did I ever tell you
about the day my dad proposed to my mom?
No.
Well, Dad was on his way
to meet my mom to propose,
and he runs into his ex-girlfriend,
Caroline Hopper.
And they're talking,
they're looking at each other,
and all these old feelings,
they start coming up.
And he's thinking,
""I could run away right now
with Caroline Hopper,
""be a happy man.
""All I have to do is kiss her.""
But instead, he looks up,
and he sees my mom
walking around the corner.
And that moment he knows
that he had no reason to be afraid.
You understand?


                                 Page 28/60

Am I Caroline Hopper in this story
or your mom?
Oh, my God! I'm your mom!
- Emily, when I saw you this morning...
- Will, please.
...I knew...
- Put that back in your pocket.
- Just stand up, Will. Stop.
...with absolute clarity.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- I have no reason to be afraid.
- Let's think about this.
- I'm not afraid of this.
It's just like the day that my...
Will!
I slept with Charlie!
I thought we had a plan.
Well, you had a plan, Will.
You have a really big plan!
- Pretty sure we both had that plan.
- I just can't keep pretending
- that I want to be part of it anymore.
- You were there
- when we made it.
- And I didn't know how to tell you.
How do you tell someone
that you care about
that you don't want the same things
- they want anymore?
- The best way?
Definitely having sex with the roommate.
It was cowardly, and I'm sorry.
Oh, good.
You're killing me.
No, I'm not. I'm letting you go.
'Cause if we stay together, Will,
we're gonna be miserable.
I'm gonna hold you back from all these...
- That's not true.
...incredible dreams that you have.
And then, eventually,
you're totally gonna hate me for it.
- No.
- Yes.


                                 Page 29/60

Will, I don't want that,
and you don't want that.
Trust me.
You're gonna be just fine, Mr. Hayes,
without me.
Wow.
Yeah.
Wow.
Here is Tom Brokaw in New York.
Good evening. Bill Clinton may have
been wounded in New York,
but the big question tonight is,
to what degree?
Because, after all, he is the big survivor,
indeed, the victor
in the New York primary
and by a comfortable margin.
Goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did
Hey.
Congratulations.
I hear they asked you to stay on.
You must be very happy.
Yeah, yeah, he did, and I am.
Very, very happy.
Really? Why do I feel
like I should hide the razor blades?
And the staplers and those scissors?
I'll be fine. But this song,
it's an excellent cure for the will to live.
I know. What about the dancing?
Make that end.
I'm sorry about the other night.
It's okay. I just didn't think
that Lucas would approve.
- Or Emily, for that matter.
- Well.
Besides, you and me,
it'd kind of be like cats and dogs.
Yeah. Yeah.
- Oil and water.
- Sandpaper and bare ass.


                                 Page 30/60

- That's gross. That's just gross.
- You'd be the ass.
Yeah. No, thank you.
- I'd be honored.
- Lennon and McCartney.
- They were good together.
- Yeah, while it lasted,
and then they couldn't even be friends.
- I think we can, at least, manage that.
- I think we could.
- Enchant.
- Yeah. Salud.
- Come on, let's dance.
- No.
- Why?
- Okay.
You ready?
- Yeah.
Guess that's it for Emily.
I can't believe that
she rehearsed with Charlie.
- I can't believe it, either.
- That leaves April. Maybe Summer.
- Anybody else?
- I was too busy.
I was too busy working on the campaign.
Anyway, when Clinton got elected,
Russell and I started our own
consulting firm,
and we worked on campaigns for everybody.
City council, state senate.
We even did one for the local dog catcher.
That's very interesting, Dad,
but what about girlfriends?
- What about Mom?
- Well, I started dating again.
- But nothing serious.
- What about April? What happened to her?
Well, a week after Kurt Cobain died,
she broke up with her boyfriend.
She went traveling.
She traveled all over the world,
just like she always dreamed of doing.
And she says


                                 Page 31/60

that it was because of something
that I said to her on her birthday.
Anyway, we started writing postcards.
We started writing letters.
And before I knew it, even though
we were separated by entire worlds,
we became great friends.
It was 1994,
and New York was full of new life.
More jobs, more money.
That was the start of the Internet.
And overnight, everyone in Manhattan
had a cell phone.
Can you hear me now?
Which they never put down.
And then, our old boss, Arthur Robredo
gave Russell and me our first big break.
- This just came for you.
- Thanks.
I had finally made it inside the room.
- Gareth.
- Hayes.
Good morning.
Hey, let's get this party started.
What's the word from upstate?
For the first time,
New York was coming to me,
instead of the other way around.
""The most endangered species in our nation
""isn't a big woodpecker
or some freshwater fish.
""It's the tongue in our heads!
""Listen to the truncated
bastard language of today.
""The average vocabulary is a third
of what it was 100 years ago.
""Words fall out of our mouths
and die at our feet!
""The landscape of vocabulary
is being hacked down
""and grubbed up by the dribble
of pop culture,
""poisoned by lazy obscenity...""
Will?


                                 Page 32/60

""... infantilized by
a youth-obsessed media...""
- Hey.
- Hey.
It's my favorite man-boy.
You look very manly.
Well, thank you, thank you. That's the aim.
- How's Emily?
- Emily.
She's starring in
somebody else's diary now.
Oh.
- How's the Professor?
- The Professor is wonderful.
- He's funny.
- He dumped me for a sophomore.
Told me it was for my own good.
Everybody seems to be
using that line these days.
What have you been up to?
I'm writing these really dumb items
for New York Magazine.
Waiting for my big break.
""And 'syntax' isn't
what Nevada brothels pay the IRS.""
- I'm gonna go listen to the Professor.
- Sure.
Nice glasses.
""Listen to your kids if you can.""
Thank you.
- Scotch, rocks, please.
William Hayes!
From... Don't tell me!
Wisconsin! Yes, the Cheese State.
Very nice of you
to come to our little shindig.
- I'll have another, please.
- Pleasure.
Yeah. Summer tells me you're writing
speeches now for Arthur Robredo?
- She tells me you're dating a sophomore.
- No. Actually, it's two freshmen,
which, on a good day,
add up to a sophomore, I suppose.


                                 Page 33/60

Walk with me. Why would you
wanna work for a hack like Arthur Robredo?
As I recall from our first encounter,
you're a man of principles and ideals, even.
Don't tell me you're just another
yuppie puppy in an Armani suit.
You were wonderful, darling.
Is he being nice? You being nice?
- Nice? Yeah, he can handle himself.
- Sure, I can handle myself.
First of all, Arthur Robredo is not a hack.
He's worked his way up from the streets.
He was a cop, an entrepreneur.
He's a putz.
This is exactly what my book is about.
Here. Read it. It's free.
Beauty, ideals,
love don't mean squat anymore.
- It's all about power and money.
- I've read every single one of your books,
and you're completely obsessed
with power and money.
That's because he doesn't have any.
Right, babe?
Babe, I am about the love.
- As you know.
- Yes.
That's why you keep me around.
To keep that rampant,
rapacious ambition of yours in check.
I have a thought.
Why don't you use that newly acquired
scintilla of power and influence
to get Summer here
to write an article about your man Robredo?
That way Summer gets a break,
and you get the word out.
- What do you get, Hampton?
- Yeah.
I guess it's the love. More of the love.
Yeah, that's what I'm about.
More love.
I knew Summer would be back.
- Did you?


                                 Page 34/60

You know what? At first,
I didn't want Summer to be my mom.
But now I'm kinda liking her.
Did you ask her out on a date?
Uh-uh.
I wanted to, but I couldn't
'cause she was writing the article.
- Wow. This is pretty good.
- Will, this is really good.
Are you sure
it didn't seem like a puff piece?
No, it's perfect. It's absolutely...
You know, there's one part, though,
that kind of bothered me.
""William Hayes,
""Robredo's chief speech writer,
is both intense and boyishly handsome.""
- Boyishly? I mean...
- Yeah.
You know, I originally wrote,
""William Hayes has seductive eyes
and the intriguing looks of someone
""whose clothes you wanna rip
from his very body,""
but the editor made me change it.
There's just no room for truth in journalism.
Did you always want to be a journalist?
No. Until I was 16, I wanted to be an actress.
I wanted to sing on Broadway.
Wow. Really?
Yeah, really. Is that hard to believe?
Well, aren't actresses needy and emotional
and, you know, insecure?
That sort of thing.
What are you saying? That I don't need?
That I don't have emotions?
- I'm an incredibly needy person.
- I'm not saying that.
- I'm a very needy person.
- You know what I'm saying?
I'm saying I would love to hear a song.
- I'm sorry?
- Give us a song.
- You want me to sing you a song?


                                 Page 35/60

- Why not?
- You have a favorite?
- Yes.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Okay.
How glad the many millions
Of Timothys and Williams would be
- I'm a William.
- Don't interrupt.
To capture me
But you had such persistence
You wore down my resistance
I fell
And it was swell
Wow.
Will you please put it on?
You know, it really isn't so bad.
You know what the funny part is?
It's $1,000.
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
Frank Sinatra, Linda Ronstadt.
- Why?
- A whole bunch of these.
Well, if you look on the back,
they all have one common song, which is...
- I've Got A Crush On You.
- Every one of them.
- How's it going?
- Still got a lot to do.
Yeah, me, too.
- Yeah, I'm about done.
- Yeah, me, too.
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on...
Was I snoring?
Uh-uh.
You know what I've never done?
What?
I've never spent the whole day in bed
with a really great guy.
Me, neither.
I'm serious.
I always think of something


                                 Page 36/60

more important to do.
I'm a workaholic.
It's really bad.
Will you spend
the whole day in bed with me?
We do nothing.
Oh.
Hi, this is Summer. Please leave a message,
and I will call you back.
This is Dr. Levenstein
from the Columbia Presbyterian
emergency room. We have...
Emergency room? Hello?
- Mr. Roth has had an aortal rupture.
- What does that mean exactly?
Think of it like a tire blowing out
on the highway
after going too fast for way too long.
How's that, Mr. Roth? Are you comfortable?
I make a living.
Come on, sweetheart, give me a smile.
I've waited my whole life to do that joke.
Poor Hampton.
Ow!
Summer's come.
- What's he doing here?
- Hello, Hampton.
Hello.
One thing they've left intact.
No, no, no, no, no, no,
don't mention grassroots.
Don't mention osmosis.
It's killing me
that you're going out with the kid.
Really? It's not the booze
or the cigarettes or the sophomores?
- That has nothing to do with this.
- Nothing to do with it.
Listen, I want you to know
I've donated my organs to medical science
except for one, which is for you.
- Sweetie, that's so kind.
- No, no, not that.
My heart, stupid.


                                 Page 37/60

Please tell me you're not in love with him.
I can't do that.
Can I have a cigarette?
Just a dying man's last request.
Not happening.
God, you're such a drama queen.
Nobody's dying.
What do you care
if I'm in love with him, huh?
You're the one who set us up, remember?
Yeah, well, I kind of figured
you'd chew him up and spit him out.
You're such a sweetie.
You're a sweet guy, you know that?
- I read the Robredo piece.
- Yeah.
The guy's been in New York politics
for over 20 years
and all you can dig up
is that his daughter had an eating disorder?
What are you saying, Hampton?
Do your job.
I can't believe
we're finally gonna meet the President.
- Look at that.
- Look at it.
We've come a long way
from that hotel room on 8th Avenue.
Thank you very much.
I don't believe it! I don't believe it!
Which idiot forgot to check the menus
and the programs?
There's no union seal
on the menus or the programs.
Are you serious?
The hotel workers won't let anybody
into the building.
The Teamsters
won't set up the satellite feed!
Has anyone seen Robert Klein?
I was with him like an hour ago.
Now he's gone.
I think he was completely plastered.
How are we supposed to know


                                 Page 38/60

where Robert Klein is?
You're not gonna believe this,
but there's a hailstorm in Chicago.
Who cares about Chicago?
We do.
The President's coming in from Chicago.
- Okay, okay.
- We can't worry about that right now.
Let me ask you a question.
How could you let this happen?
- What? What are you talking about?
- Why are you jumping down her throat?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys, guys, guys, guys, hey!
Hey, deep breath, okay?
Look, let's just ask the hotel,
see if we can use the Internet connection
and find a printer.
- I'll call Klein's agent.
- Great.
Gareth, have a drink.
You, I don't know who you are,
but your fly's down.
Be great if you wore underwear.
I'm gonna go check the weather in Chicago.
Table seven's up. Six pasta. Two fish.
Get it out the door, now!
He may not be in your union,
but he still happens to be
the President of the United States.
Remember him? So if I was you,
- I'd get your men off that truck and in this...
- Gareth!
You can't talk to a Teamster like that!
Come on.
- This guy...
- Everything's gonna be fine.
Look, look, check it out.
I downloaded a copy of the union seal.
If you could just please
paste it onto a menu,
make 500 copies, use a union shop.
We're gonna be home free, here.
Copies? You want me to make copies?


                                 Page 39/60

Well, at some point, we all make copies.
Your time is now.
That's not funny, Hayes. That's very...
Yeah, that's real mature.
Where are you going?
I'm walking! Back in half an hour.
What a dick.
- Yeah.
- William Hayes?
Speaking.
I'm watching you right now.
And I know all about you
and your friend Robredo.
In fact, I know so much,
I could bring you both down.
Really?
- Who am I speaking with?
- Why don't we meet, and you'll find out?
- Where are you?
- I'm close by.
I don't have a lot of experience with
whatever this is.
You're getting warm.
You're hot.
You're hot.
You are so hot!
I got you!
I thought you were gone
through the summer.
No, I thought so, too,
but this crazy thing happened.
I mean, I was camping
on this beautiful beach in Crete
with all these really cool people,
and there was this guy that I liked, Paco,
brooding and sexy,
monosyllabic and totally my type.
One night I'm dancing with Paco
and he kisses me,
- an incredible, deep kiss.
- Spare me the details.
- And what do I do?
- I don't know. What'd you do?
I start crying.


                                 Page 40/60

- I mean, tears are rolling down my cheeks...
- Of course you start crying.
...which he doesn't notice 'cause, of course,
his hands are all over my body,
which felt nice,
which made me feel even more upset,
'cause in a flash
I saw our entire relationship,
from present to future tense.
I mean, the incredibly hot start, with Paco
basking in my love and admiration...
- What are we doing here?
- I just got to pick something up.
Just take a second.
And then the inevitable moment,
and I don't know why it...
- Hello.
- Hi.
I don't know why it happens,
but it always does,
when all that love and admiration
would start to irritate him
and he'd find some way to hurt me.
I mean, sure, after, he'd be sorry.
So...
I decided to unlock his beautiful lips
from mine,
remove his hand from my ass,
- and I walked away.
- Good move.
- I walked away, Will! From Paco!
- Good move.
- No one walks away from Paco!
- I like the story.
And it felt life-changing.
And I realized I had to tell someone.
When I realized who that person was,
- it was so unexpected.
- Here we are, sir.
It's like when something is staring you
in the face
and it's like you're too blind to see it.
What's that?
I have some news for you, too.


                                 Page 41/60

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why are you so upset?
Don't you think it's a little weird we've been
writing each other for however long
and somehow you neglect to tell me that,
A, you've fallen in love,
and, B, you've fallen in love!
- I told you I was dating someone.
- Dating someone.
You just bought
a diamond engagement ring for someone!
I'm sorry.
I think I was just nervous to tell you.
Why would you be nervous to tell me?
I don't know.
I love this girl so much.
I'd just really like you to be happy for me.
I can be happy for you.
Of course I can be happy for you.
Poor April.
She's like the character in the story
who's always been the friend.
Then she realized
she doesn't just want to be the friend.
She wants to be the girlfriend,
except it's too late.
What do you mean?
Weren't you listening?
She came home for you.
There's union seals
on all the menus, my friend.
The weather cleared in Chicago.
The President will be here by 8:00.
Where's Russ?
Gonna meet you and Arthur
in the restaurant.
I'm funnier over here.
I can't stop my leg
You're early.
Good to see you.
- You look great.
- Thank you. You, too.
- That's a nice tie.
- Well, you'd know.


                                 Page 42/60

So, the magazine asked me
to do a follow-up on Robredo.
- Great.
- Yeah, it is great. It's also...
It's...
You just read it.
- You already wrote it.
- Yeah.
- He did this?
- Yes.
They actually got a friend an early parole.
You know what?
I think it happened such a long time ago,
and you're way ahead in all the polls.
Yeah, see, I don't think that's gonna matter,
because he's the tough-on-crime Democrat.
That's...
When people read this...
Summer, listen to me.
If you hand this in, we won't survive it.
I think it'll be a big deal for about a week,
and then the storm will pass...
I'm talking about you and me.
""Candidate Brought Down
by Speechwriter's Girlfriend.""
- Come on.
- I'm just doing my job.
I didn't do it the first time around.
And if I didn't write this,
somebody else would.
Let them.
Hey, don't hand this in, okay?
You already did.
Mr. Arthur...
Yeah, sure.
I really liked Summer.
I can't believe
she turned out to be such a...
- Heartbreaker?
- No.
- Opportunist? Double-crossing...
- Uh-uh.
- Bitch.
- Maya.


                                 Page 43/60

How could she do that to you?
It's like she said. If she didn't write it,
someone else would have.
And it was the truth.
So did she? Did she break it?
What?
What happened when the article came out?
You screwed up, man.
You really screwed up.
Please save it.
I don't need to hear this right now.
Whenever I figure out whatever
I'm supposed to learn from all this,
- I'll write you a letter!
- Yeah, can't wait.
So I lost my girl,
I lost my job, and I lost my friend.
And for a long time,
nothing seemed to matter.
But I wasn't the only one with problems.
I did not have
sexual relations with that woman,
Miss Lewinsky.
I never told anybody to lie.
- Hello?
- Are you watching?
These allegations are false.
April?
Yeah, April. Who'd you think it was?
Are you watching or not?
Of course I'm watching.
You think he did it, don't you?
I don't think, I know.
Look at the picture of her. I love her.
She's so his type.
So, what took you so long
to finally call me back there, red?
I thought I lost you.
- Feels like years.
- I'm calling you now, aren't I?
Yeah.
How are you? What's doing?
I got a new roommate, Olivia.
And I'm working at a bookstore.


                                 Page 44/60

But I've been thinking about
going back to school.
Cool.
Hey, did I tell you that I hate my job?
I used to love what I do,
and now I feel like a complete hack.
- Are you seeing anyone?
- Me? Am I... No, no. Absolutely not.
In fact, I haven't had sex
since Clinton was re-elected.
Why bother? He's having enough sex
for the entire country.
Easy. Easy now.
Hey, maybe you should
follow his lead and seduce an intern.
You know, it's funny
that you should mention that.
There's a fetching young intern
who just started a week ago.
Great. Ask her out.
I should, shouldn't I?
But I don't think I will.
You see, I don't want a fling.
I want the real deal.
Forget about the real deal.
You don't find it, it finds you.
What does that mean?
I don't know what that means.
It means that you get to a certain age
and then you're ready.
You know, you're ready for kids
or a commitment or, you know...
- Sir.
...a mortgage.
- Table's ready. Okay.
- Thanks.
You know what I mean?
And the person that you're with then,
they become the one.
So you're saying it's not who, but it's when.
- Exactly.
- Okay. All right.
So there's never been a guy, ever,
that made you think, ""This is it.


                                 Page 45/60

""This is him. This is the one.""
No.
Okay, then why aren't you out there,
you know, enjoying yourself?
I am.
- You are?
- Yes.
Right now I'm seeing this guy, Kevin.
- Kevin.
- Kevin.
Who the hell's Kevin?
Where did... How come you never,
you know, mentioned anything about him?
I'm mentioning him now.
Oh, God! They have fresh mint tea.
I love fresh mint tea.
I love beer.
It depends upon
what the meaning of the word ""is"" is.
If it means ""there is none""
that is a completely true statement.
Hey, this is April.
I want to talk to you about your birthday.
Call me.
Hello. I hope this is the right number.
It sounds like you.
It's Emily!
I'm in New York, and I was thinking
maybe we could get a cup of coffee
and catch up.
My number...
Hey, it's April. I still need to talk to you.
Please call me back.
I mean, don't make me come over there
and hurt you.
Okay, I'm coming!
God, I'm coming.
Yeah, I get it.
What are you doing in there?
- Is this what you're wearing?
- What?
It's your birthday party.
Everybody is waiting for you.
Oh, Christ.


                                 Page 46/60

Five minutes, okay? Five...
I'm down.
- Are you okay?
Yeah. I just need to lie here for a sec.
I see you've been eating noodles.
Hey, everybody, he's here!
Thanks.
Hi.
Oh, my God! I didn't think you'd be here!
I couldn't miss your birthday.
We came all the way up from Washington.
Happy birthday, gorgeous.
That is a beautiful woman right there.
You had your chance, pal.
Hayes.
Come on.
- It's great to see you.
- Yeah. You look...
Homeless, I know.
- Where's Kelly?
- She's right over there.
It's her first night out
since the baby was born.
Congratulations.
Iran-Contra. Arms for oil, no problem.
But a little ""oralness""
and you're headed for impeachment.
- No politics!
- Maybe he should be impeached.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait! Did he say that?
- Why not? I put my faith in him. We all did.
- You love him.
I thought he was gonna be different
than the other jokers,
but this guy,
he can't even define the word ""is.""
What happens if they give him
one of the hard words, like ""truth""?
- I'd vote for him again.
- In a heartbeat.
Will's a lot of fun.
Yeah, let's fill up the tub
and drop in a toaster.
That should be a good time.


                                 Page 47/60

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Will
- Where is he? Where's Will?
- I don't know. I was just talking to him.
You missed your birthday cake.
Uh-oh.
- And I baked it.
- You baked it.
Do you remember that song?
In your apartment?
Come as you are, as a friend
As a known enemy
- ""Memory,"" not ""enemy.""
- I know, I know, I know.
- Somebody had too much to drink.
- No, I didn't.
I didn't, I didn't. I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
- I did.
- God, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.
What?
The thing is...
The thing is...
Is that I like you.
I've always liked you.
""Like.""
That's pathetic. It's so puny.
""Love"" on the other hand...
You'd run away from a word like that.
I love you.
I'm in love with you, April.
- Why didn't you ever tell me?
- Come on.
You know exactly why I never told you.
You'd never be interested in me.
You're an idiot.
- Stop.
- What?
- Not like this.
- Like what?
Look at you, Will, you're a mess.
Why couldn't you have told me


                                 Page 48/60

when you had your shit together?
- My shit is together.
- Your shit is a mess.
You're a mess.
My shit is a mess?
That's interesting, coming from you, April.
You could do anything on earth,
and you work in a bookstore.
What's that all about?
At least I tried. I went out there and I tried.
Look, I'm just saying this as a friend,
and I swear, it's just as a friend,
but maybe you should go out there
and, you know, get some help.
Go to rehab or life rehab
or something like that.
I don't even know if they have
that sort of thing, but if they did...
Okay.
...you know, you could be
a prime candidate for that.
- I should go to ""life rehab""?
- Yeah.
Get off my front porch!
April?
You're right.
It is complicated, isn't it?
I mean, you're in love with April,
who used to be in love with Lucas,
and then she fell in love with you,
but you were in love with Summer,
who was always really in love with Hampton.
And now that you're in love with April,
she's in love with Kevin.
And no one's in love with you.
That's complicated.
Yep.
Then what happened?
Jane Eyre, Random House, 1943.
It's a beautiful edition,
known for the cover illustration.
But there's a really nice dedication inside,
with a quote from the book.
""To my darling daughter, April.


                                 Page 49/60

'The human heart has hidden treasures
- ""'In secret kept, in silence sealed...""'
- ""'In silence sealed
""'The thoughts, the hopes
the dreams, the pleasures
""'Whose charms were broken if revealed'
""From your loving father.""
- Hi, Olivia.
- Hi, Will.
- How you been?
- Good.
I haven't heard any of your long
sorry messages in a while.
Those were delightful, weren't they?
Sorry about that.
- April here?
- No, she's at school.
- School?
- Yeah.
- She started grad school at NYU.
- Great. Wow.
- If you want to wait, she'll be home soon.
- I'd love to.
Make yourself comfortable.
I have to finish this application I'm writing.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Hey.
How you doing?
Kevin.
Will Hayes.
I'm just waiting for April.
Are you the same Kevin
that she mentioned a while back?
I hope so. Unless she's collecting Kevins.
Kevin, phone!
Anyway, I'm pretty sure I am the only Kevin
who's actually living with her.
Do you know what you want yet?
- No.
- No?
Will?
William Hayes?
God.


                                 Page 50/60

- It is!
- Summer.
You look beautiful.
Believe it or not,
I've been meaning to call you.
- I'm pregnant.
- You're what?
- Really?
- Can you believe it?
- Please, sit. Congratulations.
- Thanks. Thanks.
Who's the lucky guy?
- Sam Knowles.
- Okay.
But he's basically out of the picture.
- He didn't make the cut, huh?
- Yeah.
Well, I don't need a guy. I never really did.
You were about the closest I ever got.
No, really, when I was with you,
I thought, ""This is it.""
But I screwed it up.
- No, you didn't.
- I did. I so did.
Listen,
I'm having a little party Sunday.
- I want you to come.
- Oh, boy.
Will you come? Please?
You know, I'll see if I can make it.
- I really want you to.
- I'll make it.
I want to make amends
with anyone I ever hurt.
And I figure it'll take about nine months,
which is perfect timing.
- And she's off. Bye.
- Bye-bye.
William Hayes.
- Dad, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
- What?
Telling me this story,
this mystery love story.
- What if I don't like who my mom is?


                                 Page 51/60

- Of course you'll like who your mom is.
And you don't have to wait long to find out,
because that very night...
It's Summer, isn't it?
And you're not my father.
No wonder you didn't want to be with her.
Take it easy, Maya. It's just a story.
And this one has a happy ending.
How does it have a happy ending?
You and my mom, whoever she is,
you're getting divorced.
What's the happy in that?
Okay, you know what?
I think we should stop now.
No!
Then how about a nice cup of tea?
If you want, I'll still continue with the story.
Does that sound good?
- Maya?
- Okay.
Dad?
I can't believe you smoked
and drank and were such a slut.
But I still love you.
Thanks.
All right. All right.
No, no. Don't eat it yet!
Not till we get to our bench.
You're in a good mood.
Well, I think I discovered
who my mom is in the story.
- Really?
- Really.
- Well, who is it?
- Not telling.
So the last time we saw William Hayes,
he had just discovered that
the woman he truly loved, April Hoffman,
was in love with another man.
I know. Shocking.
Meanwhile, he accepted an invitation
to the home of his ex-girlfriend,
Summer Hartley,
who, if she does turn out to be my mother,


                                 Page 52/60

I'm running away to Canada.
I'm not kidding.
- He died last year.
- Yeah.
- You heard?
- I read about it in The Times.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- God. Died in his office. Heart attack?
- Yeah.
I always imagined
that he'd make a more theatrical exit.
What they didn't say was he was
on the couch with the dean's daughter.
- Jesus.
- I'm kidding.
Actually, he was completely alone and
it was hours before the janitor found him.
- You want a drink?
- I'm sorry.
- You must miss him.
- I do, yeah.
These are for you.
- Oh, Will.
- Yeah.
They're beautiful.
So are you.
- Summer.
- Will.
Don't mess with me.
I can see where you're going with this.
In a second, you're gonna
say something impossibly charming.
- Really?
- Yeah. It's gonna be great.
And then you're gonna sweep me off my feet
and we all know where that's going.
- Can't a girl miss a guy?
- And you know that's gonna end badly.
Yeah, she can,
but I just don't really have time for the pain.
- So let's just skip all that, why don't we?
- Okay.
Fair enough.


                                 Page 53/60

Can we be friends?
- Yeah! Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Shake on it? Okay.
- Let's do that. All right.
You know what?
There's someone here I want you to meet.
Yeah. Come with me.
They're an old flame of mine,
and I think you guys are really gonna,
you know, hit it off.
Emily.
I'm gonna put these in some water.
- You look...
- You look...
You look great.
- Why are you in New York?
- I live here.
I took a job
with the city education department.
- I called you.
- I know.
- I've been meaning to call you back.
- Liar.
- I had lost your number.
- Of course.
- No, it's true. You know what?
- Will...
Okay, give me your number, right now.
I'm gonna put it in my cell phone,
and that way I'm never gonna lose it, okay?
My number is 212-664-7665.
Six, six, five. See? Now I got it.
And I'm never gonna lose it again.
- Oh, no, go ahead, go ahead.
- Sorry.
- Hello.
- Hey, it's Will.
I'm really sorry I lost your number.
I just had the weirdest flash
of a whole life,
one that never, ever happened.
What did happen to us?
- You slept with my roommate.


                                 Page 54/60

- Oh!
I'm sorry.
If I remember correctly,
I believe it was my ""plan,"" wasn't it?
- The plan. Remember that?
- Yes, the plan.
Who talks like that?
No, it wasn't the plan.
I was scared of you and your dreams,
and then after we broke up, I just felt lost.
I still feel pretty lost,
especially when it comes to relationships.
Yeah.
Yeah, I've been... Me, too.
Did you ever think
that maybe we just needed a different plan?
Wait! Stop! Stop right there.
Now, go back.
Okay, stop. Now go forward, slowly.
Now here it comes.
There! Right there!
That's it! That's how I figured it out!
That's what Mom does when I'm upset.
She fluffs up my hair
and tells me to be brilliant
or shine like the sun,
and it always makes me feel better.
- Sounds like a great mom.
- She is a great mom.
So you're absolutely positive,
walking toward us right now?
Absolutely.
Is it?
- Mom! Mom!
- Hey!
I'm so glad it's you.
- Well, who else would it be?
- Nobody.
- Good morning, Will.
- Hey, Sarah.
Mom, can Dad come with us to the zoo?
Yeah, if Dad wants to come, sure.
You know, I love the zoo.
Let's go to the zoo.


                                 Page 55/60

- Guess what, Mom?
- What?
We learned all about sexual intercourse
at school yesterday.
- Really?
- Really.
Really.
I love penguins.
Me, too.
Me, three.
Did you know that penguins mate for life?
Although, Mr. Monell told us
that sometimes the husband
and wife penguins get separated
'cause of their migraine patterns.
- Migratory.
- Migratory.
Well, sometimes they're apart for years,
but they almost always find each other.
Do you know
what the husband and wife penguins do
after they find each other after all that time?
Throw back their heads,
flap their flippers
and sing as loud as they can!
Okay. All right, munchkin. Let's go!
Hey, monster, that was fun today.
I'll see you on Wednesday, okay?
See you later.
Dad!
- Thanks for telling me the story.
- You're welcome.
- I forgot to tell you the happy ending.
- What is it?
You.
- Hey, I love you.
- I love you, too.
Go catch up to your mom, okay?
All right, bye.
Are you all right?
Yeah?
Mr. President! Hey, Mr. President!
Will Hayes, I worked on the '92 campaign.
Hi. I'm looking for April.


                                 Page 56/60

Check that they have
legal representation, okay?
- Right.
- Thanks, John.
I can't believe you're doing this.
- This is great.
- Thanks.
- Still smoking?
- I quit.
- Me, too. Still live in the same loft?
- Living in Brooklyn.
Always on the cutting edge.
- Dating?
- Not at present. You?
- I got divorced.
- I know.
I heard. I'm so sorry.
Why?
You always said marriage was overrated.
Yeah, and you never listened to me.
You were always with the rings.
- Is that why you and Kevin never...
- Oh, God, Kevin. No. Kevin...
Something always seemed
to be missing with Kevin.
I don't know.
It's weird. It was never quite right.
You know?
Yeah.
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.
I have something for you.
Thank you so much.
How did you find it?
I mean, where did you find it?
That's the difficult part to explain.
This is gonna sound bad.
I've had it for a while.
How long?
Years.
Many years.
I meant to...
I meant to give it to you.
I wanted to give it to you.


                                 Page 57/60

I just...
I couldn't. And I don't know why.
I dropped it off once. I mean, I tried.
Kevin was there and...
Hey, there is no excuse, and I'm sorry.
It's inexcusable.
- I think you should go, Will.
- April?
I think you should go.
You never gave it to her? After all that time?
I know. I know.
- But it was from her dad.
I know. I know.
And then you just left?
Yep.
How come you changed all the names
except hers?
What do you mean?
In the story, you know,
like Mom became Emily,
and Summer's that Natasha lady
who writes for that magazine.
But you didn't change April's name. Why?
Why are you so concerned
with all of this anyway?
Because I want you to be happy.
You know,
I'm happy.
Trust me, Dad. You're not happy.
Put your coat on.
- Taxi!
- Taxi!
She said something was missing
with Kevin,
which means
it might not be missing with you,
- which is good news, right?
- Could be.
Could be.
Did you know that 35 people try
to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge each year?
Most because of broken hearts.
I'll keep that in mind.
Hello.


                                 Page 58/60

- Hey. Hi.
It's me, Will.
April?
What are you doing here?
Uh...
Go on, tell her.
Who's that?
That would be my daughter, Maya.
That's kind of cheating, isn't it?
Bringing your daughter?
What am I supposed to do now?
Well, you could let us in.
I don't think she's gonna let us in.
I think you're wrong.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
A little while longer.
She's going to let us in.
Okay, kiddo, here's the deal.
I'm gonna count to 30, okay?
And if she doesn't let us in,
we're gonna go home,
and we're never gonna talk about this again.
- Deal?
- Yeah.
Ready?
- One, two, three...
- One, two, three...
...four, five, six...
...four, five, six...
...14, 15, 16, 17...
...14, 15, 16, 17...
If she lets us in,
tell her the story like you told me.
- And then she'll know.
- Know what?
I can't explain. She'll just know.
...25, 26, 27...
...25, 26, 27...
- Twenty-nine.
- Twenty-nine.
Twenty-nine and a quarter.
Twenty-nine and a half.
Twenty-nine and three-quarters.
What comes after that?


                                 Page 59/60

Time to go.
But this wasn't
what was supposed to have happened.
- I know.
- I really thought
she would have heard through the intercom
and let us in,
or run down the stairs and say...
What story?
What story?
- I kept the book...
- Yeah?
...because it was the only thing
that I had left of you.
- You must be Maya.
- You must be April.
So what happens now?
You invite us inside,
and we tell you the story.
Okay.

Four Weddings and a
      Funeral
      By Richard Curtis




          Page 1/49

- Good morning, Mrs. Statons.
- Morning, madam.
Late! Late!
At last.
Sorry we're late.
Put it in the back.
Oh, fuck! Fuck!
Fuck!
Oh, fuck!
Fuck! Right, we take yours.
It only goes 40 miles an hour.
What turnoff?
Better not be the B359.
It's the B359.
Fuck it!
Fuck!
Fuck.
Come on.
Fuck!
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Fuckity fuck.
Bugger.
You look fine.
Is it twisted?
Hello! You look lovely.
Hello, Charles!
There's a greatness to your lateness.
It's not achieved
without real suffering.
I am so, so sorry.
I'll kill myself after the service,
if that's any consolation.
Doesn't matter. Tom was standing by.
Thanks, Tom. You're a saint.
And a disastrous haircut.
You haven't forgotten the rings?
No.
Hate people being late.
Here we go.
Oh, isn't she lovely?
Scarlett, you're blind.
She looks like a big meringue.


                                 Page 2/49

Dear friends, what a joy it is to
welcome you to our church...
...on this wonderful day
for Angus and Laura.
Before we start the service,
let us all join together...
...in the first hymn.
And did those feet...
... in ancient time
Walk upon England's mountain green
And was the holy...
... Lamb of God
On England's pleasant...
... pastures seen
And did the countenance divine
Shine forth upon...
... our clouded hills
And was Jerusalem...
... builded here
Among those dark satanic mills
Scarlett.
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here...
...in the sight of God and in
the face of this congregation...
...to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony.
Which is an honorable estate...
...instituted in the time
of man's innocence.
- Back in a sec.
- If any man can show...
...any just cause or impediment...
...why they may not be lawfully
joined together...
...let him speak now or forever
hold his peace.
Do you promise to love her...
...comfort her, honor and keep her
in sickness and in health...
...and forsaking all others...
...keep thee only unto her for as
long as ye both shall live?
I do.


                                 Page 3/49

To love and to cherish...
Till death us do part.
...till death us do part.
Thereto, I pledge thee my troth.
And thereto, I pledge thee my troth.
Do you have the ring?
With this ring, I thee wed.
With this ring, I thee wed.
With my body, I thee worship.
With my body, I thee worship.
And with all my worldly goods,
I do thee endow.
And with all my worldly goods,
I thee endow.
If I speak with the tongues of men
and of angels, but have not love...
...I am become a sounding brass
or a clanging cymbal.
Good point.
You know I can't smile without you
Can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything
You see, I feel sad when you're sad
I feel sad
I feel glad when you're glad
If you only knew
What I'm going through
Great hat.
Thanks. I bought it specially.
There.
Get in position, please.
Thank you. Smile.
Splendid, I thought.
What did you think?
I thought, splendid.
What did you think?
Splendid, I thought.
Scarlotta, fabulous dress!
Ecclesiastical purple
and pagan orange...
...symbolize the magical
symbiosis in marriage...
...between heathen and


                                 Page 4/49

Christian traditions?
That's right.
Lovely. And again.
Any idea who the girl
in the black hat is?
Name's Carrie.
She's pretty.
American.
Interesting.
Slut.
Really?
Used to work at Vogue.
Lives in America now.
Only goes out with
very glamorous people.
Quite out of your league.
Well, that's a relief. Thanks.
See you there.
Off you go.
Right. Reception.
Bye! Bye!
Anyone else tread in a cowpat?
No, thought not. See you in a mo.
Do you think I'd hate him as much
if he wasn't my brother?
Don't want to blow chances for romance
by smelling of dung at the reception.
Oh, God. I never know what to
say in these wretched lineups.
It's a cinch. Give a big, warm
hug and say the bride looks pregnant.
Or stick with tradition,
""You must be very proud.""
Heaven preserve us.
You must be very proud.
Thank you.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hi, we've met. It's Richard Maples.
- Oh, yes.
Bastard.
- Hello, Bern.
- Hello, Chuck.


                                 Page 5/49

Two, please.
- You have fun, now.
- Take care.
Oh, hello.
Hi.
- You want one of these?
- Oh, thank you.
- I...
- Hello, Charles.
Hello, dear John. How are you?
Good. This is...
Carrie.
- Delighted. I'm John.
- Hi, John.
How's your girlfriend?
She's no longer my girlfriend.
Don't be too gloomy. Rumor is she
never stopped bonking Toby de Lisle.
She's now my wife.
Excellent.
Excellent. Congratulations.
Excuse me.
Any kids or anything, John?
Do we hear the patter of tiny...
...feet?
No.
Well, there's plenty of time for
that, isn't there? No hurry.
Hi. How are you?
My name's Fiona.
I'm Gerald.
What do you do?
I'm training to be a priest.
Good lord!
Do you do weddings?
No. No, not yet.
I will, though, of course.
Jolly nerve-racking.
Yes, rather like the first time
one has sex.
Well, I suppose so.
Rather less messy, of course.
And far less call for condoms.
Who's that boy


                                 Page 6/49

over there in the gray?
His name's David.
Something of a dish, isn't he?
Well, I've always thought so.
Why are they?
- The dish can't hear.
- Oh!
Gosh.
Yeah, silent...
...but deadly attractive.
Bang, bang, bang. That's it.
Into the marquee, please.
Dinner is served.
How do you do?
Hello, Tom. Splendid to meet you.
Very exciting.
Hi.
My name's Scarlett.
Don't let me drink too much,
because I'll get really flirty.
How do you do? My name is Charles.
Don't be ridiculous.
Charles died 20 years ago.
Must be a different Charles.
You're saying I don't know
my own brother?
No, no.
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to
drag you from your desserts.
There are one or two little things
I feel I should say as best man.
This is only the second time
I've ever been best man.
I hope I did the job okay
that time.
The couple in question are at least
still talking to me.
Unfortunately, they're not actually
talking to each other.
The divorce came through
a couple of months ago.
But I'm assured it had absolutely
nothing to do with me.
Apparently, Paula knew Pierce slept


                                 Page 7/49

with her sister...
...before I mentioned it
in the speech.
The fact that he slept with her
mother came as a surprise...
...but I think was incidental to
the nightmare of recrimination...
...and violence that became
their two-day marriage.
Anyway, enough of that. My job
today is to talk about Angus.
And there are no skeletons
in his cupboard...
...or so I thought.
I'll get to that in a minute.
I'd just like to say this:
I am as ever...
...in bewildered awe of anyone
who makes this kind of commitment...
...that Angus and Laura
have made today.
I know I couldn't do it...
...and I think it's wonderful
they can.
So back to Angus and those sheep.
So, ladies and gentlemen,
if you'd raise your glasses.
- The adorable couple.
- Yes!
The adorable couple!
The adorable couple!
Get one for me, Angus!
The first time I saw
Gareth on the dance floor...
...I feared lives would be lost.
She's a pretty girl.
The one you can't take your eyes off.
Love at first sight?
No, it's the bloke she's dancing with.
I played rugby with him at school.
I'm trying to remember what
position he played.
Though, let's say for
the sake of argument...


                                 Page 8/49

...one did take a fancy to someone
at a wedding.
Do you think there are people
who can just say:
""Hi, babe. My name's Charles.
This is your lucky night""?
If there are, they're not English.
Quite.
Three weeks is about
my question-popping minimum.
You know I love you,
Jean, don't you?
I love you.
I love you.
And Mike, I've never met you before...
...but I love you very much.
I really do.
Ignore her, she's drunk.
At least I hope she is.
Otherwise, I'm in real trouble.
How's it going, Lyds?
Bloody awful.
Oh, dear. What's the problem?
I was promised sex.
Everybody said it:
""You'll be a bridesmaid, you'll get
sex. You'll be fighting them off.""
But not so much as a tongue in sight.
Well, I mean, if you fancy...
...anything.
I could always...
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Bernard.
- I'm not that desperate.
- No, right. Of course.
Fair enough.
It's a good point.
Bye!
Have a lovely, lovely time!
Bye!
Where are you staying tonight,
Charles?
Scarlett and I are at some pub.
The Lucky Boat, something like that.
Aren't we all?


                                 Page 9/49

No. Slight change of plan.
The others are coming
back to my place.
Nansy's there. Might cook us eggs and
back over a late-night Scrabble.
Wondered if you'd like to join.
Yeah, great. Thanks very much.
Is there room for Scarlett?
Oh, absolutely.
Tommy, are you the richest man
in England?
No, no!
I believe we're about seventh.
The queen, obviously.
And that Branson bloke's
doing terribly well.
Well, excellent news.
I'll go tell Scarlett.
Yeah.
That's...
...unless you get lucky first.
Forget about it! Get out of it!
Get out. Go on!
Hi.
Hi. Hi! I thought you'd gone.
Not yet. I was just wondering
where you were staying tonight.
Well...
I was staying at some pub called
The Lucky...
...Boat or something like that.
- Boatman.
Right.
But now I'm going to stay at some
friend's house with some friends.
Well, I think enormous castle is
a more accurate description.
That's too bad because
I'm at The Boatman.
Well, it was nice...
...not quite meeting you.
It was a great speech.
Thanks.
Well, I'm going now.


                                 Page 10/49

No! No, no, don't go.
We can meet now.
The evening's just getting going.
We both know that's a big lie.
Fuck.
The castle beckons, I think, Tom.
Are you sober?
Absolutely. Orange juice all night.
Come on.
Bye, everybody!
Bernard!
Stand by your man
Wah, wah, wah, wah
And tell the world
You love him
And give him
All the love you can
Stand by...
Tom, can you stop the car?
Stop the car!
Sorry. Sorry.
I just think I might...
...stay in that pub after all.
Why on earth?
No, seriously. I'm researching
pubs with ""boat"" in the title.
I hope to produce the definitive work.
- Please yourself.
- It's a silly thing, you know?
Right.
Odd decision.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
Turned out there wasn't
room for all of us.
You said it was a castle.
No, it is a castle.
It's just a very, very small one.
Tiny. Just one up,
one down, which is rare.
Drink, sir?
Yeah. I'd like a glass
of whiskey, please. Thanks.


                                 Page 11/49

- Do you want?
- Yeah, sounds good.
- Make another one for the lady.
- Doubles, sir?
Thanks.
You here too? How are you?
Hello. I'm fine.
- Haven't seen Carrie, have you?
- Who?
Carrie. American girl.
Lovely legs.
Wedding guest. Nice smell.
No. Sorry.
Damn. Blast.
I think I was in there.
If you see her, could you
tell her I've gone to my room?
Yeah, yeah.
- Your whiskey, sir.
- Thank you.
And one for the...
Road. Lovely.
I think I might have one.
Mind if I join you?
No. It'd be lovely.
Another glass of whiskey
and a cigar.
Hold on. Make that a bottle.
We might as well settle in. Let's
see if we can push on till dawn.
- Lovely wedding.
- Yes, yes.
I was at school with his brother
Bufty. Tremendous bloke.
He was head of my house.
Buggered me senseless.
Taught me things about life.
Where you know him from?
University.
Splendid. Splendid. Yep.
I didn't go myself.
I couldn't see the point.
When you're working the money markets
what use is Wordsworth gonna be?


                                 Page 12/49

Excuse me. Your wife says,
""Could you come upstairs at once?""
Room 12, in case you can't remember.
- My wife?
- Yes, sir.
Oh, my wife! My wife!
You are drunk. You can't
remember you got a wife.
Yeah, yeah.
- Do you mind if I?
- No, no. Off you go.
- Best of luck.
- Thanks.
Lucky bachelor me, I'll have another
search for that Katie creature.
- Carrie.
- That's the one. Damn fine filly.
I think I'm in there.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Sorry about that.
That's fine.
He was hard to get rid of.
Yeah.
So...
Maybe we could just...
...skulk around here
for a bit, and then...
...go back down.
Now that's a thought.
I don't usually skulk a lot...
...but I suppose I could skulk if
skulking were required.
Do you skulk regularly?
No. No, I don't normally...
...think of myself as a skulker,
but...
Well, why don't you come in
and skulk for a while...
...and we'll see.
I noticed the bride and groom
didn't kiss in the church...
...which is kind of strange.
Where I come from, kissing is


                                 Page 13/49

very big.
Is it? Yes, well, you're right.
We probably are more reserved.
""You may now kiss the bride,"" isn't
in the book of common prayer.
I always worry I'll go too far
in the heat of the moment.
How far do you think
too far would be, then?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe...
That would be all right.
That would be fine.
In fact, it might be
a bit dismissive.
Maybe this...
...would be better.
Yeah, I think it would be dangerous
to take it any further.
I mean...
You know...
That might be taking it
a little far.
What about this?
You think the vicar would think things
had slipped a bit out of his control?
I think he might.
This kind of thing is really
better suited...
...to the honeymoon than
to the service itself.
Why do you think
it's called a honeymoon?
I don't know. I suppose it's...
...""honey"" because it's sweet
as honey.
And ""moon"" because it was
the first time...
...a husband got to see
his wife's bottom.
What's happening?
I have to go.
- Where?
- America.


                                 Page 14/49

That is a tragedy.
Just before I go...
...when were you thinking of
announcing the engagement?
Sorry. Whose engagement?
Ours.
I assumed since we slept together,
we'd be getting married.
What did you think?
What?
I...
Gosh, you know, that...
...takes a lot of thinking about,
that kind of thing.
Obviously, I'm...
You're joking.
God! For a moment there, I thought
I was in Fatal Attraction.
I thought you were Glenn Close and I'd
find my pet rabbit on the stove.
No.
But I think we've both missed
a great opportunity here.
Bye.
Oh, fuck!
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuckity, fuck.
Fuck. Fuck!
- Car or taxi?
- Taxi. We could never park.
Car seems a good idea.
- Fuck.
- Fuck.
Leave it. No one will notice.
Well...
...sorry I'm late. Traffic.
Yeah.
Who is it today?
One more, please.
They're ready to go.
In the name of the Father...
...and of the Son...
...and of the Holy Spirit.


                                 Page 15/49

Amen.
Let us pray.
Father, you have made the bond of
marriage a holy mystery...
...a symbol of Christ's love
for His church.
Hear our prayers for
Bernard and Lydia...
...through your son, Jesus Christ
our lord...
...who lives and reigns with you...
...and the Holy goat.
Ghost.
One God, forever and ever. Amen.
It's his first time.
He's a friend of the family.
- Excellent.
- Bernard and Lydia...
...I shall now ask if you freely
undertake the obligations of marriage.
Bernard, repeat after me:
I do solemnly declare...
I do solemnly declare...
...that I know not of
any lawful impediment...
...that I know not of any
lawful impediment...
...why I, Lydia...
...why I, Bernard...
Sorry.
Why I...
...Bernard Godfrey
Saint John Delaney...
Why I, Bernard Geoffrey
""St. John"" Delaney...
...may not be joined
in matrimony...
...to Lydia John Hibbott.
...may not be joined
in matrimony...
...to Lydia Jane Hibbott.
Lydia...
...repeat after me:
I do solemnly declare...


                                 Page 16/49

I do solemnly declare...
...that I know not of any
lawful impediment...
...that I know not of any
lawful impediment...
...why I, Lydia Jane Hibbott...
...why I, Lydia Jane Hibbott...
...may not be joined in matrimony...
...may not be joined in matrimony...
...to Bernard Geoffrey...
...""St. John"" Delaney.
...to Bernard...
...Geoffrey...
...St. John Delaney.
I call upon those persons here
present to witness...
I call upon those persons here
present to witness...
...that I, Bernard...
...Delaney...
...that I, Bernard Delaney...
...do take thee,
Lydia Jane Hibbott...
...do take thee,
Lydia Jane Hibbott...
...to be my awful wedded wife.
...to be my lawful wedded wife.
That's r... That's right.
May almighty God bless you all.
The Father, the Son and the
Holy spigot... Spirit.
Amen.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Bravo!
Thanks.
- We're coming, Bernie.
- Up here!
Sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.
That way? Yes, of course.
- Sorry. Could you two...
- Tom, don't go away.
Sorry.


                                 Page 17/49

I've got a new theory
about marriage.
Two people are in love, they live
together, and then suddenly...
...one day they run out
of conversation.
Totally. They can't think of
a single thing to say to each other.
That's it. Panic.
Then suddenly...
...it occurs to the chap that there is
a way out of the deadlock.
- Which is?
- He'll ask her to marry him.
Brilliant. Brilliant!
They've got something to talk about
for the rest of their lives.
You're saying marriage is a way
to get out of a pause in conversation.
The definitive icebreaker.
Tom, how's the speech coming along?
It's pretty good, I think.
Something for everyone.
Tears, laughter.
Excellent.
I think it's a very good
theory, Gareth.
There is another argument that it
has something to do with true love.
Now there's a thought.
Can I help you, sir?
Can I have three glasses
of brandy, please?
Hi.
Hello.
How are you?
Fine. Fine.
Yeah. Sorry, I'm overwhelmed
to see you.
Look, don't go back
to America. Please.
- Be back in two secs, okay?
- Okay.
Hi, Fi.


                                 Page 18/49

That's yours and yours.
See you in 5 hours.
- Something happened?
- Yes. This is a bloody great wedding.
Hi.
Well, you look perfect. In fact,
you probably are perfect.
- Well, how are you?
- I'm really well.
Charles, I'd like you
to meet Hamish, my fiance.
Excellent.
Excellent.
How do you do, Hamish?
Delighted to meet you.
Charming to find Carrie back here.
It took lots of persuading.
Come on, darling, I told James
I was getting you.
He'll think I've totally lost
control over you already.
I'll see you later.
How are you doing, Charles?
Not great, actually, suddenly.
I don't know.
I mean...
What the hell's going on here?
Why am I always at weddings...
...and never actually
getting married, Matt?
It's probably because
you're a bit scruffy.
Yeah.
Or it could also be because you
haven't met the right girl.
But you see, is that it?
Maybe I have met the right girls.
Maybe I meet them all the time.
- Maybe it's me.
- Oh, nonsense.
My lords, ladies, and gentlemen:
Dinner is served.
Come on. Odds on you meet
your wife at dinner.


                                 Page 19/49

Yes.
Oh, my God.
Charles?
Hi.
- Hello, I'm Alistair.
- Great.
And I believe you know Veronica.
Yeah. Hi, V.
Nicki.
Great.
Tell me, are you married?
No.
Are you a lesbian?
Good lord!
Well, what made you say that?
It's one of the possibilities for
unmarried girls.
It's a bit more
interesting than saying:
""Oh, dear. Just never found
the right chap.""
Quite right.
Why be dull?
Thank you.
The truth is, I have met the right
person, only he's not in love with me.
Until I stop loving him,
no one stands a chance.
Bad luck.
Yes, isn't it?
I was a lesbian once at school...
...but only for 15 minutes.
I don't think it counts.
There are 400 different
kinds of tea...
...and that's not including all these
so-called fruit teas.
I took Veronica to India to
look at the plantations.
Excellent.
I believe you and her
went there once.
That's right.
Charles was vile.


                                 Page 20/49

He insisted on cracking jokes
while I was ill.
I was cheering you up.
You're that Veronica!
Which Veronica?
Charlie?
Remember Bombay?
When Charles and I were going out,
he told me he'd had...
...this interesting journey
around India...
...with Vomiting Veronica.
I think that was it.
I don't remember ever mentioning it.
Maybe I did.
Oh, come on, Charles.
I don't think I've been out
with anyone less discreet.
That's a bit of an exaggeration.
It is not.
I remember you going on
about this girl. Helena was it?
Her mother made a pass at you.
I remember this!
You couldn't work out if it would be
impolite not to accept her advances!
That's right!
Helena was Miss Piggy,
so her mother was Mrs. Piggy.
I think perhaps it was...
We've both lost a lot of weight
since then.
Ah, great. The speeches.
My lords, ladies, and gentlemen...
...pray silence for the best man.
When Bernard told me he was
getting engaged to Lydia...
...I congratulated him, because
all his other girlfriends...
...had been such complete dogs.
May I say we are delighted to have
so many of them here this evening.
I'm particularly delighted
to see Camilla...


                                 Page 21/49

...who many of you
will probably remember...
...as the first person
Bernard asked to marry him.
If I remember rightly,
she told him to sod off.
And lucky for Lydia that she did.
It's very disappointing.
We had the most adorable girl
at our table called Carrie.
Apparently her fiance's awfully
grand and he owns half of Scotland.
- How are you?
- I'm stuck in the wedding from hell.
Ghosts of girlfriends
past at every turn.
If I see Henrietta,
the horror will be complete.
Hello, Charles.
Hello, Hen. How are you?
Oh, Hen, I...
Why can't you leave her alone?
Haven't you hurt her enough?
Excuse me. I think I'd better be
where other people are not.
Hello.
Taxi!
Good night, sir.
Thank you.
I know. It's all right.
Oh, God, this is wonderful.
Please.
Oh, wait a minute. This is no fun.
I want to see my lovely husband!
Who's a very bad bridegroom,
indeed?!
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- Yes.
- What's his name?
- Dolph. He's good at table tennis.
What about you?
No. Afraid not.
Why not?
I don't know.


                                 Page 22/49

Because most of the blokes I fancy...
...think I'm stupid and pointless...
...and so they just bonk me
and then leave me.
And the kind of blokes that do
fancy me, I think are drips.
I can't even be bothered
to bonk them...
...which does sort of
leave me a bit nowhere.
What's bonking?
Well, it's kind of like
table tennis...
...only with slightly
smaller balls.
So good!
I love my wife!
And I love my husband!
Think we'd better be
getting back?
Or we could just wait a few minutes
and have another go.
Naughty...
...naughty little rabbit.
Found it.
Charles. Charles, we must talk.
Right. You're right.
The thing is, Charlie, I've spoken
to lots of people about you.
And everybody agrees
you're in real trouble, Charles.
Am I?
You see, you're turning into
a serial monogamist.
One girl after another, yet you'll
never love anyone...
...because you never let
them near you.
On the contrary, Hen...
You're affectionate to them
and sweet to them.
Even to me, although you thought
I was an idiot.
- I did not.


                                 Page 23/49

- You did.
I thought U2 was a type of submarine.
Well, their music
has a naval quality.
Be serious, Charles. You must
give people a chance.
You don't have to think,
""I must get married.""
But you mustn't start relationships
thinking, ""I mustn't get married.""
Most of the time I don't think at all.
I just potter along.
Oh, Charlie!
Oh, God, the way you used
to look at me!
I just misread it, that's all.
I thought you were going to propose
and you were working out how to leave.
No, no. I wasn't.
Oh, God. This is ridiculous.
- Hen...
- No.
No, Hen! Hen!
No!
Having a good night?
Yes, yes.
It's right up there with my father's
funeral for sheer entertainment value.
I thought you'd gone.
No. Hamish has to take
the Edinburgh sleeper.
I'm off now. Keep me company?
Here, please.
You want to come up
for a nightcap?
You sure?
Yes. I think we can risk it.
I'm pretty sure I can resist you.
You're not that cute.
Sorry. Yeah, great.
Morning, Charles.
Breakfast's up.
Well, it's a bit burnt.
Excellent.


                                 Page 24/49

What are you up to today?
Oh, yeah.
I'm taking advantage of the fact that
for the first time in my life...
...it's Saturday and I don't have a
wedding to go to.
All I have to do
is not be late for David.
I'm gonna go for a job.
A shop called Spank
wants a sales assistant.
I think I'd be great.
They sell all this funny
rubber stuff.
Oh, no.
Another wedding invitation...
...and a list. Lovely.
Well, they say rubber's
mainly for perverts.
I don't know why. It's
very practical, actually.
You spill anything on it,
and it just comes off.
I suppose that could be why
the perverts like it.
You all right?
Yeah, yeah.
It's that girl, Carrie.
You remember...
...the American.
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.
Do you have the wedding list
for Banks?
Certainly, sir.
Lots of beautiful things for around
about the 1000 mark.
What about, things around the sort of
50 mark? Is there much?
Well, you could get
that pygmy warrior over there.
This? Excellent.
If you could find someone to chip in
the other 3950.
Or our carrier bags


                                 Page 25/49

are 1.50 each.
Why don't you just get
Yes, well, I think
I'll probably leave it.
Thanks very much.
You've been very...
What'd you get?
Blimey!
Well, I never.
Nothing yet. I'm just,
you know, deciding.
It's nice to see you.
It's nice to see you.
This present thing is great.
I should've gotten married years ago.
Did anybody go for the pygmy?
The young man was thinking about it.
Oh, no!
Just get me an ashtray.
Are you free for about a half-hour?
Yeah. I'm supposed to meet my
brother, but I can be a bit late.
Good, come with me. You have
an important decision to make.
It's crucial that you mustn't laugh.
Okay, right.
What do you think?
Divine.
Bit of a meringue?
Oh, don't worry.
We've only just begun.
What do you think?
You're kidding.
It would be wonderful, wouldn't it?
Maybe next time.
What do you think?
I knew it.
But with a staff, you
could mind sheep.
Don't be rude.
It's a bit sexy, this.
Well...
...if I were your husband,
I would die of pride.


                                 Page 26/49

You're right. It is dangerous.
There's nothing more off-putting than
a priest with an enormous erection.
One strange thing is thinking you'll
never sleep with anyone else.
You don't think
you'll be unfaithful?
No. Not once I'm married.
I told Hamish I'll kill him if he
does, so I better stick to that.
Quite right.
Anyway, I reckon I've had
my fair run at it.
What is a fair run these days
down your way?
Oh, I don't know.
More than one.
Well, come on.
Tell me.
I've seen the dress.
We have no secrets now.
Well...
The first one...
...of course not easily forgotten,
was kind of nice.

Two:
Three, four, five...
Six was on my birthday
in my parents' room.
- Which birthday?
- 17th.
We've only reached 17?
I grew up in the country. Lots of
rolling around in haystacks.
Okay, seven.
Eight, unfortunately, was
quite a shock.

Nine:
Very uncomfortable. Don't try it.
I won't.
Ten was gorgeous.
Just heaven, just...


                                    Page 27/49

Wonderful.
I hate him.

Eleven:
disappointing.
Twelve through 17:
The university years.
Sensitive, caring, intelligent boys.
Sexually speaking, a real low patch.
Eighteen broke my heart.
Years of yearning.
I'm sorry.

Twenty:
believe I've reached 20.

Twenty-one:
Twenty-two kept falling asleep.
That was my first year in England.
I do apologize.
Twenty-three and 24 together.
- That was something.
- Seriously?

Twenty-seven:
Now that was a mistake.
Suddenly, at 27,
you make a mistake?
Well, yes, he kept screaming.
It was very off-putting. I nearly
gave up on the whole thing.
But Spencer changed my mind.
That's 28.
His father, 29.
His father?
Thirty...
Thirty-one, oh, my God.
Thirty-two was lovely.
And then my fiance. That's 33.
Wow!
So I came after your fiance?
No, you were 32.
So there you go.
Less than Madonna, more than


                                    Page 28/49

Princess Di, I hope.
And you? How many have
you slept with?
Christ. Nothing like that many.
I don't know what the fuck I've been
doing with my time, actually.
Work, yeah, that's it, work.
I have been working late a lot.
I wish I'd rung you...
...but then you never rang me.
You ruthlessly slept with me twice
and never rang me.
Oh, bollocks!
Help me, please. Please.
Carrie, this is David, my brother.
Hi.
I was just telling him about
you marrying Hamish...
...and he said it couldn't have
happened to a nicer fellow.
- Where are you doing it?
- Scotland.
He says that's a beautiful place.
Hilly.
You should come to the wedding too.
I want many friends there to make
up for the stiffs that Hamish knows.
Well, you better go in.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Fuck it.
Look.
Sorry, sorry.
I just, well...
This is a really stupid question...
...particularly in view of our recent
shopping excursion.
But, I just wondered
if by any chance...
Obviously not, because I'm a git
who's only slept with nine people.
But I just wondered...
I really feel...


                                 Page 29/49

In short, to recap in a slightly
clearer version...
...in the words of David Cassidy,
in fact...
...while he was with
The Partridge Family...
...I think I love you.
I just wondered whether by any chance
you wouldn't like to...
No, no, no. Of course not.
I'm an idiot, he's not.
Excellent. Excellent. Fantastic.
Lovely to see you. Sorry to
disturb. Better get on.
Fuck!
That was very romantic.
Well, I thought it over a lot.
I wanted to get it just right.
Important to have said it, I think.
Said what, exactly?
Said...
...you know, what I just said about...
...David Cassidy.
You're lovely.
It was ordained for lifelong faithful
relationship of conjugal love.
It was ordained for the welfare
of human society...
... which can be strong and happy...
... only when the marriage bond
is held in honor.
Into this holy estate...
...these two persons now desire
to enter.
Wherefore if anyone can show
any just cause...
...why they may not lawfully be
joined together in marriage...
...let him now declare it.
Sorry.
Please rise.
Do you, Hamish...
...take this woman, Caroline,
to be your wedded wife?


                                 Page 30/49

And do you, in the presence of God
and before this congregation...
...promise and covenant to be to her,
a loving and faithful husband...
...until God shall
separate you by death?
I do.
Do you, Caroline...
...take this man, Hamish,
to be your wedded husband?
And do you, in the presence of God
and before this congregation...
...promise and covenant to be to him
a loving and faithful wife...
...until God shall separate you
by death?
I do.
Fuck-a-doodle-doo.
- Awfully nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
Hello.
You look beautiful.
- Not a meringue in sight.
- Thanks.
Blimey.
It's Brigadoon.
It's bloody Brigadoon!
Dear old things, as you know...
...I've always been proud there isn't
a wedding ring between the lot of us.
Over the passing of years, it's
suddenly beginning to distress me.
I'd like to go to the wedding of
someone I really loved, for a change.
Don't blame me. I've asked
practically everyone I know.
You haven't ask me.
- Haven't I?
- No.
Oh, Scarlett.
Would you like to?
No, thank you. It was very nice
of you to ask.


                                 Page 31/49

Well, anytime.
Quite right, Tom. That's the spirit.
Tonight, these are your orders:
Go forth and conjugate.
Find husbands and wives.
Excellent plan.
What do you think, Fifi?
Spot a potential hubby
in the throng?
- Bugger off, Tom.
- Quite right.
A toast before we go
into battle.
To true love.
In whatever shape
or form it may come.
May we all in our dotage

be proud to say:
""I was adored once too.""
- True love.
- True love!
Apparently, an enormous number
of people...
...actually bump into their future
spouses at weddings.
Which is interesting.
Yes, I met my husband
at a wedding.
Good lord, I seem to have finished
my drink. If you'll excuse me.
Hello. My name's Scarlett.
Named after Scarlett O'Hara,
but much less trouble.
What's your name?
My name's Rhett.
No.
Not really!
No, not really.
In fact, it's Chester.
You kidder.
I always imagine Americans are going
to be dull as shit.
I mean, of course


                                 Page 32/49

you're not, are you?
Steve Martin's American, isn't he?
Yes, he is.
You're lovely.
Come on!
Hello, Charles.
Oh, Hen. Hi.
I'm sorry. I couldn't
really bear a scene today.
I know we probably
got tons to talk about.
Did I behave that atrociously
last time?
- Remember the shower scene in Psycho?
- Yeah.
Scarier.
Oh, God, I'm depressed, Hen.
How are you?
I'm cheerful, actually.
I weigh almost nothing.
And I've got a divine new boyfriend.
- Perhaps we should've married.
- Good God, no.
I'd have had to marry your friends.
I'm not quite sure I could take Fiona.
Fiona loves you.
Fiona calls me duckface.
Well, I never heard that.
Look, darling, come to lunch soon.
Give me a ring, okay? Oh, still cute!
How's duckface?
Good form, actually. Not too mad.
Ladies and gentlemen:
The bride and groom.
You like this girl, don't you?
Yes.
Yes, it's a...
It was a strange thing
when at last it happens.
And...
...she's marrying someone else.
How about you, Fifi?
You identified a future partner
for life yet?


                                 Page 33/49

No need, really.
The deed is done.
I've been in love with
the same bloke for ages.
Have you?
Who's that?
You, Charlie.
It's always been you.
Since first we met...
...oh so many years ago.
I knew the first moment.
Across a crowded room.
Or lawn, in fact.
Doesn't matter.
There's nothing either of us can do.
Such is life.
Friends isn't...
...bad, you know? Friends is
quite something.
Oh, Fi.
It's not all easy, is it?
No.
Just forget this business.
Not to be.
Matthew, darling.
Where's Gareth?
Torturing Americans.
How thoughtful of him.
Do you actually know Oscar Wilde?
Not personally, no.
But I do know someone who could get
his fax number for you.
Shall we dance?
Well, any rings on fingers?
Oh, Gareth, you don't know
how lucky you are.
Finding someone to marry is
a very tricky business.
It's hell out there. Matthew's
trapped with a Minnesotan evangelist.
Come down, sweet Jesus,
and cast out the devil!
My lords, ladies, and gentlemen...
...please charge your glasses.


                                 Page 34/49

First, and rather unusually,
we have the bride.
Excellent. I love this girl.
Thank you.
I'd like to thank all of you
who flew in from the States.
I'm really touched.
For you others, I'd have thought lots
of frightful Americans flying in...
...was an excuse for staying away,
so I thank you too.
If my darling dad
had been here today...
...he would have been speaking now.
I know he would have said:
""Great dress, babe...
...but why in the hell are you
marrying the stiff in the skirt?""
And I would have given him
the same answer that I give you:
""Because I love him.""
As John Lennon said, who died
the same year as my dad:
""Love is the answer.
And you know that for sure.""

One more thing:
Someone told me here, that if
things with Hamish didn't work out...
...that he'd step in. So thanks,
and I'll keep you posted.
Bravo!
And now, my lords, ladies

and gentlemen:
Anyone involved in politics
for the last 20 years...
...has gotten used to being upstaged
by a woman.
I didn't expect it to happen to
me on my wedding day.
However, I must also say...
...that I'm quite happy
to be upstaged by this woman...


                                 Page 35/49

...for the rest of my life.
Some barracking at the back again?
Something we politicians are used to.
- Shit. Find a doctor.
- Right. Okay.
First, I want to extend my
compliments to the bridesmaids.
You did your duty superbly.
I intend to use you every time
I get married from now on.
I want to thank all those wonderful
ladies of the parish...
...who did the flowers in the church.
The stern old building took on
a look of flushing youth today.
I remember the first time
I laid eyes on Caroline.
I thought to myself, ""If by any chance
she's shortsighted...
...I might just be happy
for the rest of my life.""
I thought I could see my future
for the first time.
It was a joyful one...
...for years and years to come.
For he's a jolly good fellow
For they are jolly good fellows
For they are jolly good fellows
And so say all of us
Good morning, and a warm welcome
to you all on this cold day.
Our service will begin
in a few minutes.
But first we have asked Matthew...
...Gareth's closest friend,
to say a few words.
Gareth used to prefer
funerals to weddings.
He said it was easier to get
enthusiastic about a ceremony...
...one had an outside chance of
eventually being involved in.
In order to prepare this speech, I rang
people to get a general picture...


                                 Page 36/49

...of how Gareth was regarded
by those who met him.
""Fat"" seems to have been a word
people most connected with him.
""Terribly rude"" also rang
a lot of bells.
""So very fat and very rude"" seems to
have been the stranger's viewpoint.
On the other hand, some of you have
rung me to say that you loved him...
...which I know he would have been
thrilled to hear.
You remember his fabulous
hospitality.
His strange experimental cooking.
The recipe for duck la banana...
...fortunately goes with him
to his grave.
Most of all...
...you tell me of his enormous
capacity for joy.
And when joyful...
When joyful, for highly vocal
drunkenness.
But I hope joyful is how
you will remember him.
Not stuck in a box in a church.
Pick your favorite of his waistcoats
and remember him that way.
The most splendid...
...replete...
...big-hearted...
Weak-hearted, as it turned out.
- And jolly bugger
most of us ever met.
As for me, you may ask
how I will remember him.
What I thought of him.
Unfortunately, there
I run out of words.
Forgive me if I turn from
my own feelings...
...to the words of another




                                 Page 37/49

splendid bugger:
W.H. Auden.
This is actually what I want to say:
""Stop all the clocks.
Cut off the telephone.
Prevent the dog from barking
with a juicy bone.
Silence the pianos,
and with muffled drum...
...bring out the coffin.
Let the mourners come.
Let the airplanes circle,
moaning overhead...
...scribbling on the sky the message:
He is dead.
Put great bows around the white necks
of the public doves.
Let traffic policemen
wear black cotton gloves.
He was my north, my south,
my east and west.
My working week and my Sunday rest.
My noon, my midnight,
my talk, my song.
I thought that love
would last forever...
...I was wrong.
The stars are not wanted now...
... put out every one.
Pack up the moon
and dismantle the sun.
Pour away the ocean
and sweep up the wood.
For nothing now can ever
come to any good.""
Bye, now.
I'll take you home, Scarlett.
It's good of you to come.
Must have been the shortest
honeymoon in history.
No, it's fine.
We'll do it some other time.
That thing you said in the street?
Yes. I'm sorry about that.


                                 Page 38/49

No, I liked it.
I liked you saying it.
Charlie, I'll take Scarlett
home, all right?
Yeah.
Darling Fi.
Walk, Charlie?
Yeah. Yeah, that would be grand.
Never felt like that. I mean,
something vaguely similar for Jilly...
...when I was young.
Jilly?
Labrador.
Yes, it's odd, isn't it?
For years we've been single
and proud and never noticed...
...that two of us were, for all intents
and purposes, married all this time.
Traitors in our midst.
You know, in a way, I think death
is hardest for the parents, don't you?
I hope I die before my children.
Tom...
...there's one thing I find really...
It's your total confidence
that you will get married.
I mean, what if you never
find the right girl?
Sorry?
Surely, if that service
shows anything...
...it shows that there is
a perfect match.
If we can't be
like Gareth and Matthew...
...maybe we should just let it go.
Some of us are not
going to get married.
Well, I don't know, Charlie.
The truth is, unlike you...
...I never expected the thunderbolt.
I always just hoped that I'd meet
some nice, friendly girl...
...like the look of her.


                                 Page 39/49

Hope the look of me didn't
make her physically sick.
Then pop the question...
...and settle down and be happy.
It worked for my parents.
Well, apart from the divorce
and all that.
I'll give you six months
at the outside, Tom.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Maybe all this ""waiting
for one true love"" stuff...
...gets you nowhere.
What the fuck is going on?
I thought we better make
absolutely sure we weren't late.
Excellent wedding hairstyle.

Matthew:
man in the world.
Listen...
...thank you for doing this today.
Of course.
I wish Gareth was here.
Bet he does too.
I'm sorry I was so late.
The others are just parking the car.
I thought we'd all go with Tom.
Late? So late?

Yeah, it's 9:

- 9:
- Yep, 45 minutes till ""I do.""
Bloody Tom! I told him
to set the alarm for 8:00.
Fuck it!
Fuck!
Scarlett.
- Oh, hi.
- You ready?
Absolutely.
Give me 20 seconds.
- Time?


                                   Page 40/49

- Honestly?
Yes! Time?!

About 10 to 9:
Bastards.
Jessica, stop jumping
up and down, please.
This is splendid tuck.
Yes, I think I might say
a little word.
As many of you know, I've closely
observed Charles' love life for years.
Recently, I'd started to despair
and fear that he was married to us.
Apart from the fact that we won't
have his babies.
I don't know about that.
Fortunately, it's
turned out splendidly.
The girl in question
is sadly crazy...
...but perhaps that's why
he loves her.
I'd like to propose a toast to
my Charlie and his beautiful girl...
...on this tragic day.
So be happy and don't forget us.
Thank you.
To Charles and duckface.
To Charles and duckface!
- What do you think?
- You look divine.
It does work, doesn't it?
Yes.
I thank Fiona for those charming
words about my future wife.
I'd like to take this opportunity...
...to read a little message
from her to you all.
This is exciting.
She says, ""If any of you come near the
house, I'll set the dogs on you.""
I think that's rather a nice touch.
""I'll set the dogs on you.""


                                 Page 41/49

John, hi.
You made it. Good.
I hope me damn sister turns up.
Not much of a wedding without a bride.
Bit of a poor show, you not
having a stag night.
We did. We did.
We didn't think it was a very good
idea in this day and age.
Really?
Fi, you do look lovely today.
Yes, as you can see I've abandoned
my traditional black.
Yes, so you have.
From now on, I shall be all
the colors of the rainbow...
...and fall in love with someone who
fancies me for a change.
Darling Fi.
- Look.
- What?
Lipstick everywhere.
That won't do at all.
Hi. Hi.
Good luck.
Hello. Glad you could come.
How are you?
Groom's on the right. Bride's, left.
Groom on the right.
Bride on the left.
Oh, my God!
I thought you'd gone back to Texas.
Without you, never.
Good luck.
The bride or groom?
Bride or groom?
It should be perfectly obvious
I'm neither.
Great God!
Bride or groom?
Bride.
Yes...
...fine.
I've got a feeling we've met before.


                                 Page 42/49

We have. About 25 years ago.
I'm second cousin Harold's daughter,
Deirdre. You're Tom.
Good lord!
- So you're family.
- Yes.
Only very distant.
Well, yes, of course.
You said you were bride?
Yes.
Well, do sit.
Do sit here, Deirdre.
Golly.
Thunderbolt city.
Hello, Matthew.
- Hello, Charles.
- Bernard, how are you?
Exhausted, actually.
- That's funny. Charles.
- Hello, Lyd.
Hi.
Hi.
You look lovely.
But I always did like you
dressed for weddings.
- And on time!
- Yep! Extraordinary thing, isn't it?
How's Hamish?
Oh, he's fine, I believe.
You believe?
Well, yes, he wasn't the man
for me after all.
You left him?
We left each other.
When?
A few months now.
March was hell. By April,
it was sordid.
That's the last time I marry
someone three times my age.
Charlie? Charles, time to travel.
Yeah. Yeah.
Coming. Good.
Good.


                                 Page 43/49

So why didn't you
get in touch, then?
I did think about it.
I wanted to, but...
I was in a state.
So anyway, I don't want to keep you.
And I'll see you afterwards.
Yeah. Fine, excellent.
Wait.
I'll show you to your seat.
Just showing her to her seat.
Our timing's been
really bad, hasn't it?
It's been bad, yes.
It's been a disaster.
It has, as you say, been...
...very bad indeed.
God, it's lovely to see you.
Well, good luck.
It's pretty easy.
Just say ""I do"" whenever anyone
asks you a question.
Could you just give me a sec, Matthew?
Yes, of course. Freshen up at will.
Dear lord, forgive me
for what I'm about to...
...say in this magnificent
place of worship.
Bugger!
Bugger!
Bugger! Bugger! Bugger!
Bugger!
Can I help at all?
Huh? No. Thanks.
Sorry.
Vocal exercises. Big church.
Excellent. Often do the same myself.
Not exactly the same
vocab, obviously.
Rather more hallelujahs.
I'll leave you.
Bride's arriving.
Fabulous! We seem to have
lost the groom.


                                 Page 44/49

Stall her, and I'll see
if I can find him.
Roger. Wilco.
Charles.
It's good to see you.
Yeah. Yeah.
Matt, what do we think about marriage?
Gosh.
Well, I think it's really good...
...if you love the person with
all your heart.
Well, exactly.
Quite.
All these weddings. All these years.
All that blasted salmon and champagne.
Here I am on my own wedding day...
...and I'm still thinking.
Can I ask about what?
No.
No, I think best not.
I'm sorry, there's a delay. A
problem with the flowers.
Flowers? What?
Unfortunately, there are a high
proportion of hay fever sufferers...
...who've been stuck right by
the damn flowers.
So we're moving the congregation.
Don't want the vows
obliterated by sneezing.
Would it be out of place for me to say
time's ticking by?
Should've started by now.
I think I've fooled them so far.
If you have a reputation for being
stupid, people are less suspicious.
Hello.
Here you are.
Ready to face the enemy?
Are we?
Yes.
Excellent.
Not so tight, Dad!
Dearly beloved...


                                 Page 45/49

...we are gathered together
here in the sight of God...
...and in the face
of this congregation...
...to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony...
...which is an honorable estate...
...instituted of God in the time
of man's innocence.
Signifying unto us
the mystical union...
...that is betwixt Christ
and His church...
...and therefore is not
by any to be enterprized...
...nor taken in hand unadvisedly,
lightly, or wantonly...
...but reverently, discreetly,
advisedly...
...soberly, and in the fear of God.
Therefore, if any man can show
any just cause...
...why they may not
lawfully be joined together...
...let him speak now
or else hereafter...
...forever hold his peace.
I'm sorry, does someone have
something to say?
Yes? What is it?
One second.
What's going on?
- He wants me to translate.
- What is he saying?
He says, ""I suspect the groom
is having doubts.
I suspect the groom would
like to delay.""
""I suspect the groom...""
What's he saying?
He says...
...he suspects the groom...
...loves someone else.
And do you?


                                 Page 46/49

Do you love someone else?
Do you, Charles?
I do.
Get out of my way!
Let me kill him!
Blimey.
At least it's one we won't forget.
A lot of weddings just blend
into each other.
Oh, for God's sake.
This one will stick out
in the memory.
For not actually including
a wedding service.
Poor girl.
No, I mean it, poor girl!
She's not my favorite person...
...but what you did today
might be unforgivable.
I can't bear to think about it.
Poor Hen.
Though, let's face facts.
If you weren't sure
you wanted to marry her today...
...of all days, i.e.,
your wedding day...
...then it must be the right
decision, mustn't it?
Quite right, Tom.
It was a lovely dress.
Useful for parties.
What did he say, Charles?
Says he blames himself.
Absolutely not.
No, you mustn't, David.
No, no. If there's
music to be faced...
...I should be facing it.
Hello.
Hi! You're soaking. Come in.
No, no. I'm fine.
Comes a point you can't get wetter.
- Okay, I'll come out.
- No, please don't.


                                 Page 47/49

I just wanted to check
you're okay.
Not busy killing yourself
or anything, but...
But you're fine, so...
I shouldn't have come to the church
this morning. I'm sorry.
No! No!
Wait. It was all my fault.
I mean, I'm the bastard here.
And it definitely sorted out one
thing, which is, marriage and me...
...we're very clearly not meant
for one another.
Sorted out another big thing as well.
There I was, standing there
in the church...
...and for the first time in
my whole life I realized I...
...totally and utterly
loved one person.
And it wasn't the person standing
next to me in the veil, it's...
...the person standing
opposite me now...
...in the rain.
Is it still raining?
I hadn't noticed.
The truth of it is...
...I've loved you from
the first second I met you.
You're not suddenly going
away again, are you?
No. I might drown,
but otherwise, no.
Okay, okay. We'll go in.
But first, let me ask you one thing.
Do you think...
...after we've dried off...
...after we've spent
lots more time together...
...you might agree...
...not to marry me?
And do you think...


                                 Page 48/49

...not being married to me might
be something you could consider...
...doing for the rest of your life?
Do you?
I do.

          by

     Woody Allen




                   Shooting Script, 1986

As the last credit appears, the song ends in a crescendo and
the screen fades to total black.

Immediately, a new melody begins, an uptempo jazz number, as
a title appears on the screen.

""God, she's beautiful...""

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A full face of Lee, wearing a gray sweater and leaning against
the dining room doorway. She gazes into the camera with a
half-smile on her face as Elliot speaks over the screen.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          God, she's beautiful.

Lee glances over her shoulder, then turns from the doorway
and walks away. The camera follows her, moving across a
book-and-photograph-filled bookshelf that obscures her from
view as she walks into a crowded, comfortable vestibule.

People, some holding drinks, some just entering the apartment,
surround her. Everyone is talking at once, carrying on easy,
familiar conversation.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          She's got the prettiest eyes, and
          she looks so sexy in that sweater.

Lee smiles at the various people, exchanging greetings.

                      LEE
          Hi, how are you?

Two more guests enter the apartment; the vestibule is full
now. Still walking, Lee lightly hugs one of the children as
she continues on her way towards the living room. Elliot's
voice, as well as the jazzy music, is heard.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          I just want to be alone with her and
          hold her and kiss her...

Lee walks into the living room, turning her head back for a
moment to talk to the child she has just hugged.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          ...and tell her how much I love her
          and take care of her. Stop it, you
          idiot. She's your wife's sister.
          But I can't help it.

                                                            2.

The camera is still moving with Lee as she smiles and stops
to chat with her mother. Elliot's voice, as well as the
music, continues over the low din of warm conversation.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          I'm consumed by her. It's been
          months now. I dream about her. I-
          I, I think about her at the office.
          Oh, Lee.
              (sighing)
          What am I gonna do?

Lee starts to walk off again, finishing her conversation
with her mother. She passes several other guests, then turns
to greet April, giving her a warm, brief hug.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          I hear myself mooning over you, and
          it's disgusting. Before, when she...

Elliot's voice-over continues as he is actually seen, standing
in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing, rotund
man. Both are holding drinks as Lee, carrying a tray of
hors d'oeuvres and two drinks, walks between them. The space
is very tight; the men hold up their drinks to make room for
her.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          ...squeezed past me in the doorway,
          and I smelled that perfume on the
          back of her neck...

Elliot watches Lee walk off; the other man, oblivious,
continues to talk. Elliot reluctantly returns to the
conversation, but he can't help turning his head to gaze at
the offscreen Lee as the other man chatters on.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          ...Jesus, I, I thought I was gonna
          swoon! Easy...

The camera resumes following a smiling Lee. She has just
put down the tray and drinks near April, and briskly and
obliviously, she walks past a doorway where Elliot, still
ruminating, watches her, entranced.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          You're a dignified financial advisor.
          It doesn't look good for you to swoon.

The camera stays with Elliot, who is still watching the
offscreen Lee. In the background, guests continue to chatter
warmly with each other.

                                                         3.

Hannah, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres, walks up behind
the distracted Elliot.

                      HANNAH
              (nibbling on an hors
               d'oeuvre)
          Elliot? Elliot?
              (rubbing his shoulder)
          Sweetheart?

Elliot returns from his reveries with a start.

                      ELLIOT
              (turning to Hannah)
          Mm-hm?

                      HANNAH
              (pointing to the tray)
          Have you tried these? These are
          wonderful.
              (nibbling, swallowing)
          Holly and her friend made them.

Elliot, taking one of the hors d'oeuvres, starts nibbling as
well as he and Hannah walk past the bookshelf into the living
room.

                      ELLIOT
              (swallowing)
          They're fantastic.

                       HANNAH
              (overlapping, still
               eating)
          Aren't they great?

                      ELLIOT
          Your sister is an unbelievable cook.

                      HANNAH
              (swallowing)
          I know! I know!

Elliot and Hannah, eating and talking, walk past a hallway
and offscreen as Holly appears, walking down the hallway.

She holds a drink and a plate of hors d'oeuvres; she stands
at the entrance to the hallway, eating and looking at the
offscreen guests.

                      HANNAH
              (walking offscreen)
          She has all the cooking talent.

                                                            4.

                      ELLIOT
              (walking offscreen
               swallowing)
          No, she doesn't, either.   You've got
          tons as well.

                      HANNAH
              (offscreen)
          Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.

Holly, standing in the hallway onscreen, swallows loudly.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen, overlapping
               Holly)
          Holly, why don't you open your own
          restaurant?

                      HOLLY
              (turning to the
               offscreen Elliot and
               Hannah, trying to
               swallow)
          Mmm, we practically are. Well...
              (holding her hand to
               her mouth)
          not a restaurant, but...
              (swallowing)
          April and I are going to do some
          catering!

                      HANNAH
              (offscreen)
          What? You're kidding!

                      HOLLY
              (nodding)
          No, no, we decided!

Holly takes a sip of her drink as Hannah and Elliot walk
over to her.

                      HANNAH
          Perfect!

                      HOLLY
              (nodding and swallowing)
          Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for
          our friends, so
              (gesturing)
          we thought until an acting job comes
          through, we could just make some
          extra money, you know, doing a few
          private parties.

                                                            5.

                      ELLIOT
              (nodding)
          Great idea.

                      HANNAH
              (agreeing)
          I know.

                      ELLIOT
              (overlapping Hannah)
          That's where your talent lies.

                      HOLLY
              (swallowing and nodding)
          I know.

Holly and Hannah begin to laugh.

                      HOLLY
              (gesturing to Elliot,
               still laughing)
          Get outta here.
              (to Hannah)
          Could I speak to you privately?

                      HANNAH
          Oh, sure.

Holly and Hannah walk off; Elliot watches them leave.

                      ELLIOT
              (calling after them
               as he nibbles on an
               hors d'oeuvre)
          I'm her husband! She tells me
          anything!

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. HANNAH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Hannah, licking her fingers, walks past a memo-cluttered
refrigerator to the stove as Holly, behind her, begins to
speak. The faint sounds of music are still heard.

                      HOLLY
          Hannah, I have to borrow some more
          money.
              (sipping her drink)
          Don't get upset.

                                                            6.

                       HANNAH
               (stirring some food
                in a saucepan on the
                stove)
          Mmm, I never get upset over that.
          Mmm?

                      HOLLY
          This is the last time, I promise.
          And I'm keeping strict accounts.

As Holly talks, sipping her drink, Hannah busily works in
the kitchen, which contains a large center table stacked
with bowls and plates of food, hanging pots and pans, and
general party clutter. She walks on-and-offscreen as she
talks and listens to her sister.

                      HANNAH
          Holly, please. Don't insult me.

                      HOLLY
              (putting her empty
               glass and plate down
               on the table)
          Someday, I'll pay it all back.

                       HANNAH
          I know.   H-how much do you need?

                      HOLLY
          Two thousand dollars.

Hannah, who'd been mashing some food in a bowl on a nearby
counter, hesitates momentarily. She turns to Holly.

                      HANNAH
              (trying to nod her
               head casually)
          Uh-huh.

                      HOLLY
              (gesturing, her back
               to the camera)
          Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my
          friend April and I, we have this
          catering idea I think's going to be
          great.

Hannah, licking her fingers, walks past Holly.

                      HOLLY
              (turning to face Hannah)
          You admit that we're great cooks,
          right?

                                                         7.

                       HANNAH
              (nodding, back at the
                stove now, stirring
                in a pot)
          Yeah.

                      HOLLY
              (putting her hands in
               her pockets)
          Well, in order to get started, there's
          just a few things I have to buy...
              (gesturing)
          and some old debts I have outstanding.

                      HANNAH
              (looking at her sister)
          Will you just tell me one thing?

                      HOLLY
              (nodding)
          Okay.

                      HANNAH
          Are we talking about cocaine again?

                      HOLLY
              (shaking her head no)
          I swear. I swear. We've already
          got some requests to do a few dinner
          parties.

A timer goes off. Hannah walks past Holly to attend to some
food on a different stove. Holly turns to face her. Only
Holly is seen as she talks to the offscreen Hannah, the camera
moving in closer on her face. As Holly speaks, she
distractedly nibbles an hors d'oeuvre. In the background,
her parents can be heard singing in the living room.

                      HOLLY
          I mean, obviously, I'm not going to
          be a caterer forever, you know. We
          both still go to auditions. Something
          could turn up at any moment. But
          the parties are at night, days are
          free, I can still take my acting
          class. I haven't done drugs on a
          year.

Holly pops another hors d'oeuvre into her mouth as the

background singing gets louder and the film cuts to:

                                                         8.

INT. HANNAH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The living room is crowded with family and guests sitting
comfortably on chairs near the piano, where Evan, Hannah's
father, plays ""Bewitched"" as Hannah's mother, Norma, sits
nearby, accompanying him in their duet. A child is sprawled
out under a blanket on a sofa; some guests chatter quietly;
others drink and eat, listening.

                      EVAN & NORMA
              (singing)
          ""A whimpering, simpering Child again
          Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered
          Am I...""

As they continue to sing, the film cuts back to the kitchen,
where Lee, carrying some glasses, enters through the doorway.

                      LEE
          Mom and Dad are floating down memory
          lane again!

Lee walks over to her sisters, putting the glasses down on a
counter. Hannah is scooping seeds out of a cantaloupe.

Holly, leaning on the table, sips her drink. The music from
the living room is softly heard as the three sisters chat
comfortably and easily with each other.

                       HANNAH
              (smiling and turning
               to Lee)
          Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and
          her friend's shrimp puffs?

                      LEE
              (nodding to Holly,
               touching her arm)
          I think they're fantastic.

                      HANNAH
              (to Holly)
          You've outdone yourself.

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping her
               sisters, shrugging
               and smiling)
          Oh, my God. Thank you.

                       LEE
              (interrupting, to
               Hannah)
          I need an antihistamine. Mom thinks
          she's feeling her asthma, and so...

                                                         9.

                         HANNAH
                 (overlapping)
          Ohh?

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping, lighting
               a cigarette)
          Uh-oh.

                      LEE
              (continuing)
          ...before she starts turning into
          Camille...
              (laughing)

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping)
          Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up
          in the morning.

                      LEE
              (turning to Holly)
          At least she isn't drinking.   Did
          you notice?

                      HOLLY
              (nodding)
          Mm-hm.

                      HANNAH
              (turning to look at
               her sisters, laughing)
          Doesn't she look great in that new
          dress?

                      HOLLY
              (nodding)
          Yeah.

                      LEE
              (nodding)
          Yeah.

The sisters all talk at once; Hannah is still working at the
sink.

                      HANNAH
          Don't you think she does?

                      HOLLY
          She really does, though.

                                                          10.

                      LEE
              (turning towards the
               sink)
          Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's
          flirting with all the men here.

                         HOLLY
                 (puffing on her
                  cigarette)
          God.

                      HANNAH
              (scooping out some
               cantaloupe seeds)
          Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop
          straightening her garter belt when
          there's a guy around.

                      HOLLY
              (to Lee, laughing)
          I should get a garter belt.

                      LEE
              (laughing)
          Yeah.

                      HOLLY
              (looking down at
               herself)
          Get a garter belt...
              (sipping her drink)
          Get a garter belt and flirt.

                      LEE
              (laughing, to Hannah)
          Where are the antihistamines?

                      HANNAH
          Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that.
          Uh, he's got them somewhere.

                      LEE
              (nodding)
          Okay.

Lee leaves the kitchen.    Holly, puffing on her cigarette,
watches her go.

                      HOLLY
              (sighing)
          Frederick didn't come with her.

                                                        11.

                       HANNAH
               (turning to Holly,
                still working at the
                sink)
          When does Frederick ever come with
          her?

                      HOLLY
              (whispering intently)
          Tch. He's such an angry...he's such
          a depressive. I thought she was
          moving out!

Hannah shakes her head in disapproval while Holly angrily
takes another sip of her drink.

And the film cuts briefly back to the living room, where
Evan is still playing the piano and singing. The camera
moves past him and a few guests to Norma, who is
enthusiastically singing along, looking at Evan and moving
her hands.

                      EVAN & NORMA
              (singing)
          ""A pill he is But still he is All
          mine and I'll Keep him until he is
          Bewitched, a'both--""

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. HANNAH'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The table is beautifully set for Thanksgiving dinner, complete
with candles, flowers, cut crystal, china, and silver.
Hannah's children are playing in the room as Hannah enters,
carrying a huge roast turkey. Behind her is Holly, carrying
a casserole. Hannah's parents can still be heard singing in
the background.

                      HANNAH
              (to the children)
          Watch out, you guys. Beep-beep!

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping)
          Oh, your kids are so adorable.

                      CHILDREN
              (walking through the
               doorway)
          Bye! Bye!

                                                        12.

                      HOLLY
              (putting down her
               bowl on the table)
          God, it gets so lonely on the
          holidays.

                      HANNAH
              (setting down the
               turkey on the opposite
               end of the table)
          Oh, gosh. Well, you know, that's
          why I invited Phil Gammage tonight.

As the sisters talk, the piano music stops. There's the
sound of light applause as Evan begins a new song, faintly
heard in the dining room.

                      HOLLY
              (grimacing, reacting
               to Hannah)
          Oh, Hannah!

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping)
          It's, uh, you never know--

                      HOLLY
              (interrupting,
               gesturing)
          He's such a loser!

                      HANNAH
          He's not a loser at all!

                      HOLLY
              (shaking her head)
          Oh, he's such a loser!

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping, lighting
               a set of candles on
               the table)
          He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.

                      HOLLY
          Oh, perfect! He reminds me of Ichabod
          Crane.
              (moving her hand up
               and down her throat)
          His Adam's apple keeps jumping up
          and down whenever he gets excited.

                                                         13.

                      HANNAH
              (laughing)
          Listen. He's a lot better than your
          ex-husband. He's got a good job.
              (handing a pack of
               matches to Holly)
          Would you light those, please?
          He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or
          anything.

                      HOLLY
              (striking a match to
               light another set of
               candles)
          Give me a break.

                      APRIL
              (offscreen)
          Am I interrupting...

The film cuts to April, standing in the doorway of the
dining room and holding a drink.

                      APRIL
              (continuing)
          ...any sister talk?

                      HANNAH
              (offscreen)
          Mm-mm!

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          Come in.

The camera moves with April as she walks over to the table,
where Hannah and Holly are lighting candles.

                        APRIL
          Oh, good...

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping, still
               offscreen)
          Come in, come in.

                      APRIL
              (gesturing)
          ...because there are no interesting
          single men at this party!

                      HANNAH
              (now onscreen)
          Oh, listen...

                                                        14.

                      HOLLY
              (interrupting, waving
               out her match)
          I know. It's terrible!

                      APRIL
              (shaking her head)
          I mean, I've looked everywhere.

                      HANNAH
              (picking at the turkey
               and gesturing)
          Maybe April would like Phil. Phil
          Gammage, the tall guy in there by
          the piano.

Holly groans, looking at her sister, while April sips her
drink and nods.

                      APRIL
              (pointing to herself)
          Hm-mm. Oh, yeah. I met Phil.

                         HANNAH
                 (looking at April,
                  nodding)
          Mmm?

                      APRIL
          He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?

Hannah screams with laughter as she walks toward the end of
the table, past a gleeful Holly, who points her finger at
Hannah as she passes. Hannah, still laughing, playfully
pushes the accusing finger away.

                      APRIL
              (laughing with the
               sisters, gesturing)
          I love that. That's my type.

                      HANNAH
              (shaking her head,
               laughing)
          I can't believe it!

She walks over to a nearby china cabinet.

                      APRIL
              (nodding and looking
               at Hannah)
          No, really, I really like him a lot.

                                                        15.

                       HOLLY
              (overlapping, laughing
               and gesturing)
          No, really, we mustn't get
          discouraged.

As Holly continues to tease her sister, Hannah opens a drawer
in the cabinet. She takes out two apples decorated with
paper turkey heads and tails and hands them to April.

                      HOLLY
              (fussing at the table)
          Hannah will invite some men over who
          don't look like Ichabod Crane.

                         APRIL
                 (overlapping)
          Mmm.

April starts to put the turkey apples on the table. A bemused
Hannah takes two more out of the cabinet and places one of
them on the table as well.

                      HOLLY
              (straightening a table
               setting)
          Not this Thanksgiving, you know.

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping, to April,
               who has just set
               down her apples)
          Here. Be careful with those.

                      HOLLY
              (continuing her
               teasing, gesturing)
          Maybe at Christmas, New Year's. If
          not this New Year's, maybe next New
          Year's.

While Holly is talking, Hannah hands her the last turkey
apple, accidentally sticking her with one of the toothpicks
that keeps the decorations in place.

                      HOLLY
              (reacting)
          Ouch!

                         HANNAH
                 (turning to her sister
                  in surprise)
          Oh!

                                                        16.

The film cuts to a short hallway leading to a bathroom in
Hannah's apartment. In the foreground is a standing lamp.

In the background, Elliot is seen walking inside the bathroom,
looking around the room. Light piano music is dimly heard.

                      ELLIOT
              (searching)
          Must be here someplace.

He walks out of the bathroom, moving down the hallway towards
the camera.

                      LEE
              (offscreen)
          Oh, you know, I, I love that book
          you lent me. The Easter Parade?

You were right.   It had very special meaning for me.

                      ELLIOT
          How's Frederick? He didn't come.

Elliot walks into the bedroom as Lee continues to talk
offscreen. The camera, leaving Elliot, moves across the
room, past a wall of framed paintings, a headboard and bed,
a night table and lamp, revealing Lee. She is flipping through
a book by a curtained window.

                      LEE
              (offscreen)
          Oh, well, you know Frederick. One
          of his moods. Although it wasn't a
          bad week. He
              (onscreen)
          uh, sold a picture.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen)
          Oh, great.

The camera stays with Lee as she walks around the room, past
another curtained window, a television set, and a rolltop
desk. She absently flips through the book as she talks to
the offscreen Elliot.

                      LEE
          Yeah, it was, it was one of his better
          drawings, a very beautiful nude study.
          Actually, it was of me.
              (laughing)
          It's funny, you know, it's a funny
          feeling to know you're being hung
          naked in some stranger's living room.

                                                           17.

Lee puts the book she's been holding down on the desk, only
to pick up another one. She looks at the offscreen Elliot.

                      LEE
          Well, you can't tell it's me, although--
              (pausing)
          You're turning all red, Elliot.

She reacts. The camera moves to a blushing Elliot, following
him now as he walks across the room.

                      ELLIOT
              (laughing self-
               consciously)
          Really? So, so, what else?   Wh-
          what are you up to?

                      LEE
              (offscreen)
          Oh, I don't know. My unemployment
          checks are running out. Um, I was
          thinking of taking some courses at
          Columbia with the last of my savings.

As Lee speaks, Elliot parts a hanging curtain against the
wall to reveal a stereo and some records. He looks at the
offscreen Lee.

                         ELLIOT
          Like, uh...?

                      LEE
              (offscreen)
          I don't know exactly.

As Elliot reaches inside the stereo shelf, grabbing a bottle
of antihistamines, the camera moves back to Lee, who sits
down on the bed. She is still holding a book.

                      LEE
          Uh, sociology, psychology maybe. I
          always thought I might like to work
          with children.

Elliot walks over to Lee; he sits down on a footstool in
front of her.

                      ELLIOT
              (gesturing with the
               bottle of pills
               gripped in his hand)
          Incidentally, I-I always have clients
          who are furnishing places.

                                                       18.

                      ELLIOT (CONT'D)
          Some of them might-might be interested
          in buying art. Shall I, shall I
          call you?
              (chuckling self-
               consciously)

                      LEE
          Yeah, sure.
              (taking the bottle of
               pills Elliot hands
               her)
          You know, uh, Frederick would really
          by grateful for a sale.

She chuckles; Elliot smiles and chuckles with her.

                      HANNAH
              (offscreen)
          Hey, you guys?

Elliot turns in the direction of his wife's voice.

                      HANNAH
              (offscreen)
          Dinner's ready.

Hannah, eating a carrot stick, enters the bedroom. The camera
stays with her momentarily as she walks towards Elliot and
Lee.

                      LEE
              (offscreen)
          Oh, great.

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping)
          You look so beautiful.

                      LEE
              (offscreen)
          Come on.

                      HANNAH
              (standing by Elliot
               and Lee)
          Doesn't she look pretty?

                      LEE
          I bumped into your...

                       ELLIOT
              (overlapping, agreeing
                with Hannah)
          Yeah.

                                                        19.

                       LEE
               (continuing)
          ...ex-husband on the street the other
          day.

                      HANNAH
              (biting her carrot)
          Oh, yeah?

                       LEE
              (gesturing)
          He was, he's just as crazy as ever.
          He was on his way to get a blood
          test.
              (laughing, Elliot
                joining in)

                       HANNAH
               (reacting)
          God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac.
          I wonder how he'd handle it if there
          was ever anything really wrong with
          him?

                      ELLIOT
              (standing up)
          Let's go have dinner, shall we?

                         HANNAH
                 (overlapping)
          Mmm.

                      LEE
              (standing up,
               overlapping)
          Good idea.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone is seated around the table for Thanksgiving dinner.

Facing the camera are Holly, Lee, Norma, and Hannah. She
sits to the left of Elliot, who's at the head of the table.

On his right is Evan; April sits next to him. She and the
other guests sit with their backs to the screen. The table
overflows with food, floral decorations, and candles. In
the background, the children sit at a separate table; a maid
serves them turkey. The guests chatter comfortably among
themselves as they eat.

                                                        20.

                      EVAN
              (clanking a piece of
               silverware against
               his water glass)
          Now, ladies and gentlemen...

                         HOLLY
                 (making a face)
          Dad.

Evan continues to clank his glass to get everyone's attention.

                         HOLLY
          Dad...

                      LEE
              (reacting, to Holly)
          Oh...

                         HOLLY
          Dad!

                      EVAN
              (still clanking)
          No, now...

                      HOLLY
          I'm starving!

Resigned, Holly puts down her silverware. Lee smothers a
laugh. Norma, reacting, glances at Holly and Lee. Everyone
knows what's coming.

                      EVAN
              (clanking away)
          ...this is a toast!      This is a toast.

                      HANNAH
              (reaching across the
               table for Evan's
               wine glass, laughing)
          Get his wine away.

                      EVAN
          This is a toast. You know this
          beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was
          all...

Holly laughs. Lee glances over to her, reacting. Hannah,
embarrassed, reacts and sits with her hands on her face.

Lee and the rest of the guests put down their silverware.

They look at Evan, listening.

                                                          21.

                      EVAN
          ...prepared...by Hannah.

Hannah, embarrassed, makes a victory sign.

                      HANNAH
              (modestly pointing to
               the maid)
          Uh, and a little help...

Lee and Holly try to suppress their laughter.    Norma glares
at them.

                         NORMA
                 (to her daughters)
          Hey!

                      HANNAH
              (continuing)
          ...from Mavis, also.

Elliot wraps his arm around Hannah; he pulls her towards him
affectionately and kisses her on the cheek. She hugs him
back.

                      ELLIOT
              (hugging Hannah)
          You bet.

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping, looking
               down the table while
               still in Elliot's
               embrace)
          Holly and April, thanks for helping.

Mavis the maid exits, carrying some trays, as the group starts
to cheer and applaud. Holly waves her napkin at April, then
holds up her wine glass.

                      EVAN
              (overlapping the noise)
          No, you did it.

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping, toasting
               her friend)
          April, April!

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping, gesturing)
          I am... I did slave all day.

                                                         22.

                      EVAN
              (overlapping, holding
               out his wine glass)
          And we drink to her, and we all
          congratulate her on her wonderful
          accomplishment during this last
          year...her great success in A Doll's
          House!

The group continues to cheer as they all toast Hannah.   She
reacts, smiling but embarrassed.

                       NORMA
              (overlapping, laughing)
          Ya-a-a-a-y!
              (laughing)
          I played Nora. I hate to tell you
          what year...

The guests, sipping their wine, quiet down as Norma continues
to speak. Lee and Holly unsuccessfully try to contain their
laughter. Mavis reenters the dining room to serve more food
to the children.

                      NORMA
              (continuing)
          And it's very difficult to behave
          like Torvald's little chipmunk without
          making a perfect ass out of yourself!
              (pausing while the
               guests laugh heartily)
          Now I think that Ibsen would have
          been damn proud of our Hannah!

Norma toasts her daughter; everyone follows her. The applause
and cheers begin anew. Hannah, reacting, chuckles.

                       APRIL
              (overlapping the
               applause and clapping
               loudly)
          Speech! Speech! Speech!

                      NORMA
              (overlapping)
          Yea-a-a-a-ah!

A few guests sip their wine. They all quiet down as Hannah
starts her speech, glancing around the table and gesturing.

                      HANNAH
              (reacting)
          I don't know about that.
                      (MORE)

                                                        23.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)
          Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been
          very, very lucky. W-when I had the
          kids, I decided to stop working and
          just, you know, devote myself to
          having the family, and I've been
          very, very happy
              (banging her fists
               lightly on the table)
          but...I've always secretly hoped
          that maybe some little gem would
          come along and tempt me back on the
          stage...

                      EVAN
              (nodding)
          Yeah.

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping)
          ...just for a second. So, now I got
          that out of my system and I can go
          back to the thing that makes me
          happiest.

Hannah tenderly takes Elliot's hand as she looks around the
table. He, in turn, kneads her shoulder, chuckling with
equal tenderness.

                      EVAN
              (chuckling)
          Oh, bravo! Bravo!

Hannah, still embarrassed, looks down at a plate. The group
applauds once more, toasting and drinking, and warmly sounding
their approval.

                                                     CUT TO:

""We all had a terrific time.""

Classical string music plays as the film cuts to:

EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT

A taxi moves down Broadway towards the camera, passing a
truck on the right, the Winter Garden marquee advertising
Cats, and several buildings, and as the taxi moves offscreen,
the classical music still playing, the movie cuts to the
taxi's backseat. Lee sits by the window, leaning her head
in her hand, a reflective look on her face. Her voice is
heard over the screen.

                                                        24.

                      LEE (V.O.)
          Is it my imagination, or does Elliot
          have a little crush on me?
              (chuckling slightly)
          It's funny. I've had that thought
          before. He pays a lot of attention
          to me all the time, and he blushed
          tonight when we were alone in the
          bedroom. I wonder if he and Hannah
          are happy? It's funny, I...I still
          feel a little buzz from his flirting.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. FREDERICK'S LOFT - NIGHT

Lee stirs a cup of coffee on the counter of the loft's modern
kitchen area; a nearby vase hold flowers. She walks across
the loft, with its high ceilings and beige walls, holding
her coffee.

                      LEE
              (to an offscreen
               Frederick)
          Want some coffee or tea?

                      FREDERICK
              (offscreen)
          No, thank you.

Lee continues to walk, past a modern chaise, a bookcase,
some sofas, two columns. Lamps hang down from the ceiling.

The classical music still plays in the background. Lee stops
at a plastic-enclosed work area. Frederick can be seen
working at a drawing board on the other side of the clear
plastic screen.

                      LEE
              (stirring her coffee)
          How about something to eat?

                         FREDERICK
          No, nothing.

The background music stops.

                      LEE
          Are you sure?

                         FREDERICK
          Absolutely.

                                                   25.

                      LEE
              (walking around the
               screen to Frederick)
          Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
              (laughing)
          As Lee walks over to the drawing
          board where Frederick is sitting, he
          is seen intently cleaning some
          paintbrushes with a rag. Lee stands
          by him, leaning over the board, and
          looks directly at him. The table is
          filled with cans of brushes and
          artist's equipment.

                      LEE
          God!
              (sniffing)
          And why didn't you come tonight?
          We all had a terrific time. I really
          think you would have enjoyed yourself.

                      FREDERICK
              (not looking at Lee)
          I'm going through a period of my
          life where I just can't be around
          people.
              (putting down the
               brushes and wiping
               his hands with the
               same rag)
          I didn't want to wind up abusing
          anyone.

                      LEE
          You're not going to abuse them.
          They're all so sweet.

                      FREDERICK
              (taking off his glasses)
          Lee...
              (pausing, reaching
               for Lee's hand)
          you are the only person I can be
          with...who I really look forward to
          being with.
              (pulling Lee to him,
               around the board)

                      LEE
              (compliantly)
          You're too harsh with everyone.
          You know that, don't you?

Frederick and Lee embrace; Lee sighs.

                                                           26.

                      FREDERICK
              (looking into Lee's
               eyes)
          Isn't it enough that I can love you?

                      LEE
              (sighing)
          Mmm...

                      FREDERICK
          Hmm?

                      LEE
              (overlapping)
          ...you're such a puzzle.
              (chuckling)
          So sweet with me and so...contemptuous
          of everyone else.
              (sighing)

                      FREDERICK
              (sniffing)
          Well, there was a time
              (sniffing again)
          when you were very happy to be only
          with me. You wanted to learn
          everything about poetry, about music.

                      LEE
              (nodding)
          Mm-hm.

                      FREDERICK
          Have I really taught you everything
          I have to give?
              (shakes his head)
          I don't think so.

Lee kisses Frederick twice, then releases him and walks out
of the work area.

                      LEE
              (turning her head in
               Frederick's direction)
          Oh, Elliot said he might have a couple
          of clients for you.

Lee walks over to the loft's stereo area, pulling up the
sleeves of her sweater as Frederick talks.

                      FREDERICK
              (offscreen)
          I'm sure all those morons he handles
          have a deep feeling for art.

                                                        27.

Lee picks up a book from the stereo shelf. She leans back
against the unit, glancing through its pages.

                        LEE
                (flipping through the
                 book)

                      MMM
              (chuckling)
          you never know. They might. He's
          just trying to do the nice thing.

                      FREDERICK
              (offscreen)
          Because he likes you.

                        LEE
                (looking up from the
                 book)
          Me?

                        FREDERICK
          Yeah.

Frederick, leaving his work area, walks past Lee; his hands
are in his pockets.

                      FREDERICK
              (looking at Lee as he
               goes by)
          Elliot lusts after you.

                      LEE
          Based on what? You never even see
          him.

The camera stays with Frederick as he walks into the loft's
bedroom area.

                      FREDERICK
          Based on...whenever you see him, you
          always come home full of books he's
          recommended...

He sits down at the foot of the bed and starts taking off
his shoes.

                      FREDERICK
              (continuing)
          ...or films you must see or...
              (shrugging)

                                                           28.

                      LEE
              (walking over to him)
          Oh, no, no, no. He's my sister's
          husband. And I think if you gave
          him half a chance, you'd like him.

He's very intelligent.

Lee sits down next to Frederick; he takes her hand.

                      FREDERICK
          He's a glorified accountant, and
          he's after you.
              (kissing Lee's hand)
          And I prefer to sell my work to people
          who appreciate it, not to rock stars.
              (kissing Lee's face)
          You understand?

Lee kisses Frederick back on the cheek.   They embrace.

Frederick laughs; their embrace gets tighter.

                      LEE
              (sighing)
          Ohhh!

                                                      CUT TO:

The hypochondriac.

Upbeat jazz plays in the background and continues as the

                                                FILM CUTS TO:

INT. TV STUDIO CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Metal elevator doors open and Mickey Sachs, a high-powered
television producer, walks out, deep in conversation with
his assistants, Paul and Larry. As the elevator operator
begins to reclose the door with his passengers, Mickey, his
assistants fast behind, walks down an office corridor past
busy groups of studio personnel. Indistinct conversation,
as well as the jazz, is heard in the background as the trio
talk.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          What do you mean, they won't let us
          do the sketch?

                      PAUL
          Talk to Standards and Practices.
          They think it's too dirty.

                                                        29.

The trio pass Mary, another assistant, in conversation with
two other co-workers. She holds a clipboard.

                      MICKEY
          But we showed it to them in rehearsal!

Without missing a beat, he takes Mary's wrist and continues
walking.

                      MICKEY
              (to Paul)
          You know, what'd they do, figure out
          what the words mean?

A foursome now, they briskly walk past a man and a woman
going over a script. Mary and Mickey lead; Paul and Larry
follow.

                      MARY
          Mickey, we got a half hour to air!

As the group walks through a large doorway, Larry catches up
to Mickey.

                         LARRY
          We're short!     The show is five minutes
          short!

The group turns right into a new corridor, briefly off the
screen. As they scurry off, their voices are heard.

                      MICKEY
          How could it be short?    We timed
          everything
              (offscreen)
          long.

                      PAUL
              (offscreen)
          If we have to...

They are all now seen walking down the new corridor towards
the camera. The corridor is crowded with busy TV personnel.

The group continues to talk frantically as people hurry past
them. One man pushes rudely past Mary as he walks; she looks
back at him briefly.

                      PAUL
              (continuing)
          ...pull out the sketch, then we'll
          be ten minutes short!

                                                         30.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          I don't know how they can do that to
          us. That's-- We go on in thirty
          minutes, right?

Mary checks her wristwatch as they rush down the corridor.

                      LARRY
              (squeezing past several
               passersby)
          They're doing it because our ratings
          are low.

                      MICKEY
              (nervously rubbing
               his forehead)
          I got such a migraine.

As the group briskly walks past an open door, Gail, another
assistant, runs out, brandishing her glasses.

                       GAIL
              (offscreen)
          Hey, Mickey!

Gail runs in front of the group. Without missing a step,
she faces Mickey and walks backwards, gesturing and talking
frantically.

                      GAIL
          Mickey! Listen, we better go right
          to Ronny's dressing room. This kid
          must have taken sixteen hundred
          Quaaludes. I don't think he's going
          to be able to do the show!

The fast-tracking group turns the corner.   Gail pats Mickey's
back; she gestures in exasperation.

                       MICKEY
              (gesturing towards
               heaven)
          Why me, Lord? What did I--

He is interrupted by Ed Smythe, an official from the Standards
and Practices Department, who's been standing in the corridor
waiting for Mickey. Mickey stops and shakes Ed's hand as if
he'd known the official would be there.

Gail stops by his side while the others walk into a background
studio doorway that is busy with scurrying personnel.

                                      31.

            MICKEY
You--
    (pointing)
Standards and Practices?

            ED
Ed Smythe, yes.

            MICKEY
Okay. Why, all of a sudden, is the
sketch dirty?
    (putting his hands on
     his hips)

            ED
    (gesturing)
Child molestation is a touchy
subject...

            MICKEY
    (overlapping, looking
     at Gail)
Could you--

            ED
    (continuing)
...with the affiliates.

            MICKEY
    (overlapping and
     grunting)
Read the papers! Half the country's
doing it!

            ED
    (pointing at Mickey)
Yes, but you name names.

            MICKEY
    (gesturing)
We nev-- We don't name names!
    (turning to Gail for
     support, briefly
     touching her
     shoulders, then
     looking back at Ed)
We say the Pope.

            GAIL
    (gesturing emphatically)
We always say the Pope!

            ED
That sketch...

                                                           32.

                         MICKEY
                 (overlapping)
          We--

                      ED
              (continuing)
          ...cannot go on the air.

A writer, holding a script, walks out of the background
studio, looking around.

                         MICKEY
          Oh, Je--

                         WRITER
                 (interrupting, shouting)
          Hey!

Mickey, Gail, and Ed turn towards the writer.

                      WRITER
              (angrily, slapping
               his script)
          Who changed my sketch about the PLO?

Mickey and Gail walk over to the angry writer, Ed forgotten
with this new crisis.

                       MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          I had to make some cuts.    It's four
          lousy lines!

                      WRITER
          The whole premise is ruined!

Mickey, Gail, and the writer start walking down a corridor
adjacent to the studio.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing, trying to
               calm the writer down)
          Oh, you're crazy! It's not so
          delicate. Everybody's married to
          every line.

The writer reacts angrily.    Gail tries to get Mickey's
attention as they walk.

                      GAIL
              (tapping Mickey's
               shoulder)
          Mickey, I can--

                                                        33.

                      WRITER
              (interrupting, angrily
               gesturing)
          I don't care! I don't want anyone
          tampering with my goddamn work without
          telling me!

                      MICKEY
              (shrugging)
          Okay.

                      WRITER
              (pointing angrily)
          You want 'em cut?! I'll cut 'em
          myself!

Mickey, still in surprised shock, turns away from the angry
writer. He stands by an open dressing room, where Ron, an
actor, slouches, dazed, in a chair facing a makeup mirror.

People mill in the background behind the actor.

                      MICKEY
              (shrugging, distracted)
          All right, all right.
              (muttering)

                      GAIL

               to get Mickey's
               attention and
               gesturing)
          Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.

                       MICKEY
              (distractedly, his
               mind still on the
               writer)
          You know...
              (muttering as the
               writer passes him
               and walks away)

                      GAIL
              (overlapping, gesturing)
          In-in-in-instead of the child
          molestation sketch, why don't we
          repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald
          Reagan homosexual dance number?

                         MICKEY
                 (still distracted,
                  looking off)
          No--

                                                          34.

                         RON
                 (overlapping)
             I don't feel good, Mickey.

Mickey, remembering Ron, runs into the dressing room. Gail
follows him. Inside, a man and a woman talk, ignoring Ron.

They share a drink in a paper cup.    The woman looks back at
Ron; she gestures with disgust.

                         MICKEY
                 (gesturing)
             Yeah, wh-- Yeah, what did you do?
             Swallow a drugstore?!

Ron coughs.

                         MICKEY
                 (to Gail)
             Look at this guy.

                          GAIL
                 (overlapping, touching
                   Ron's chair)
             Yeah?

                         RON
                 (groaning)
             I lost my voice.

Gail walks around the chair. The camera shows she and Mickey
talking to Ron through the reflection in the cluttered makeup
mirror.

                         MICKEY
                 (reacting)
             Oh, Jesus!

                         GAIL
                 (gesturing)
             Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to
             go on in twenty-five minutes.

Ron sighs.

                         MICKEY
                 (looking around,
                  touching his stomach)
             Hey, does anybody got a Tagamet?
             My, my ulcer's starting to kill me!

                         RON
                 (sighing)
             You want a Quaalude?

                                                            35.

Mickey, as reflected in the mirror, starts to pace as the

                                                 MOVIE CUTS TO:

EXT. BEVERLY HILLS BOULEVARD - DAY

Norman, a Los Angeles TV producer and Mickey's former partner,
is driving down a peaceful street lined with palm trees.
He's wearing sunglasses and headphones. He clicks his fingers
in time to the music only he hears on his Walkman. He's
smiling contentedly while Mickey talks over the sun-filled
scene. The continuous background jazz plays louder.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          Christ, this show is ruining my
          health! Meanwhile, my ex-partner
          moves to California and every stupid
          show he produces turns out to be a
          big hit. Brother, what am I gonna
          do with my life? Speaking of that,
          I-I...gotta remember to see my ex-
          wife tomorrow. Tch.

INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT FOYER - DAY

As Mickey finishes his ruminations, Hannah is seen walking
towards her front door. She opens it, her back to the camera.
Mickey stands there holding two boxed gifts. The jazz stops.

                      HANNAH
          Hi!   Hi!

                      MICKEY
              (overlapping, sniffing)
          I know...I know.

                      HANNAH
          Glad you could put in an appearance.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          I got two minutes.

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping)
          Very good.

Hannah nods as Mickey comes inside.   She closes the door
behind him.

                                                          36.

                      MICKEY
              (overlapping)
          I got two minutes. 'Cause, God, the
          show is killing me. I got a million
          appointments today. It just so
          happens it fell this way.

Hannah continues to nod patiently, patting Mickey on the
back, as they make their way across the foyer into the den,
where the twins are playing. Mickey wears his coat.

                       MICKEY
          I gotta see new comedians later,
          I've gotta--

                       HANNAH
               (interrupting)
          Two minutes on your sons' birthday.
          You know, it's not going to kill
          you.

Her voice trails off as Mickey walks over to the twins.

                      MICKEY
          Happy Birthday, fellas!   Happy
          Birthday!

Hannah's twins greet Mickey with cries of ""Hi, Daddy!"" and
indistinct chatter.

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping their
               chatter, bending
               down to talk to her
               sons)
          Guys, look what Daddy brought.
          Presents!

Mickey hands a gift to each twin.   They grow quiet, suddenly
shy.

                      MICKEY
              (to his sons)
          Yeah, aren't you like, you know...

                         HANNAH
                 (overlapping)
          Huh?

                      MICKEY
              (continuing, holding
               out his arms)
          ...a little, uh, hey! A little hug!
          What is this? Now how 'bout a little
          action from the kids?

                                                        37.

The twins put down their gifts, one on the sofa, one on the
coffee table, and hug their father.

                      MICKEY
              (turning to Hannah)
          How is everything?

                       HANNAH
              (picking up the gift
                on the sofa and
                nodding)
          Everything's good. Everything's
          fine.

                       MICKEY
               (nodding, overlapping)
          Yeah? Yeah?
               (pointing)
          Okay, kids, you can open the presents
          now.

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping)
          Here, you guys. Open them up.

Hannah makes room on the coffee table for the gift she is
holding; she places it next to the other one. The boys start
opening them.

                      MICKEY
          Let me get a little reaction here.
              (to Hannah, putting
               his hands in his
               pockets)
          How's Elliot?

                       HANNAH
          He's fine.

                       MICKEY
          Yeah?

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping)
          Oh, you know what? I'm trying to
          convince him to produce a play.

                       MICKEY
          Oh!

                      HANNAH
          I think he'll find that satisfying.

                                       38.

            MICKEY
    (nodding)
Really? That'll be terrific for
him, I think.

               HANNAH
I think so.

               MICKEY
I like him.     I think he's a sweet
guy.

             HANNAH
    (stroking one of the
      twins' backs)
Yeah.

            MICKEY
The few times that I've met him...
    (pointing to the
     baseball mitt twin
     #1, has taken out of
     his box)
Isn't that a great mitt?

            TWIN #1
Thank you, Daddy.

            MICKEY
    (overlapping to Hannah)
'Cause he's a loser.

               HANNAH
       (overlapping, to Twin
        #1)
Ohh!

            MICKEY
    (overlapping, gesturing)
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy
like me...

            HANNAH
    (overlapping, chuckling)
I know, I know.

            MICKEY
    (overlapping)
...so I, so I like that. I always
like an underconfident person...

            HANNAH
    (overlapping, touching
     the mitt and reacting)
That's really nice!

                                                            39.

                      MICKEY
              (still rambling on,
               gesturing to Hannah)
          ...you know? I, uh...

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping)
          You know, he's been wanting a mitt.

She helps Twin #2 open his present.      It's a football.

                      MICKEY
          You've always had good taste in
          husbands, so...

                      HANNAH
              (chuckling and nodding)
          Thanks, thanks.

                         MICKEY
          Mh-hm.

                      HANNAH
              (leaning down to look
               at the football)
          That's a beauty!

                      MICKEY
          Isn't that great?

                         HANNAH
          Oh!

                      MICKEY
              (pointing, to Twin #2)
          Go right over there.

                         HANNAH
          Football!

Twin #2, panting, runs offscreen to catch the football.

                      MICKEY
              (to the offscreen
               twin)
          Come on! Hurry up! Let's go!

                         HANNAH
                 (looking offscreen at
                  twin #2)
          Wow!

                                                         40.

                      MICKEY
              (still pointing,
               gearing up for the
               pass)
          Go out, go out by the Sung vase and,
          and catch this.

Mickey throws the football.

                         MICKEY
          See?
                 (whistling)

                      HANNAH
              (pointing offscreen)
          Hey, d-- Watch, watch the picture.

There's a sound of breaking glass.   Hannah and Mickey react.

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

Mickey is walking up a West Side street, his hands in his
coat pockets. Jazz plays in the background as he talks over
the screen.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          Gee, Hannah's sweet. Although,
          sometimes I still do get angry when
          I think of things. Oh, what the
          hell. At least, I'm not paying child
          support.
              (sighing)
          Oh, God, I hope there's nothing
          physically wrong with me, either.

Mickey pushes open the outside door of Dr. Abel's office, as
the movie cuts to the doctor's consultation room. The doctor
is framed in the doorway, looking through a file cabinet.

                      DR. ABEL
              (taking out Mickey's
               file)
          So what's the, uh, problem this time?

                      MICKEY
              (offscreen)
          This time I really think I have
          something.

While Mickey answers him offscreen, Dr. Abel turns and walks
toward him. The camera follows the doctor's movements from
the other side of the wall, obscuring him briefly.

                                                        41.

It moves across a dark examining-room wall to a second
doorway, where Mickey sits on a stool, continuing to talk to
the offscreen Dr. Abel.

                      MICKEY
              (onscreen)
          I mean, I'm absolutely convinced
          that-that-- You know, I mean, it's
          not like that adenoidal thing, you
          know, where I didn't realize I had
          them out.

Dr. Abel walks back onscreen. Both he and Mickey are now
seen through the second doorway. Dr. Abel sniffs and stands
directly in front of the sitting Mickey. He stares down at
him as Mickey talks.

                       MICKEY
               (continuing, gesturing)
          So, so, but it was when I was younger,
          so--

                      DR. ABEL
              (overlapping,
               interrupting)
          You know, I saw your father this
          week about his sinus...

                      MICKEY
              (folding his arms on
               his chest)
          Mm-hm.

                      DR. ABEL
              (continuing)
          ...and, uh, he complained of chest
          pains.

                      MICKEY
          Well, this guy's the real
          hypochondriac of the family.   I mean,
          he's, you know, he's--

                      DR. ABEL
              (interrupting)
          You mentioned on the phone that you'd
          had some dizziness.

                      MICKEY
              (rubbing his hands on
               his knees)
          Yes, a little dizziness, and I think,
          I think I'm developing a hearing
          loss in my right ear
                      (MORE)

                                                        42.

                       MICKEY (CONT'D)
               (poking at his ears
                and gesturing)
          ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh,
          n-n-n-no. No, I'm sorry. It was my
          right, my right, my right or my left
          ear.

Dr. Abel chuckles.

                      MICKEY
              (nodding and gesturing)
          Now I ca-can't remember.

                      DR. ABEL
          Let's take a look.

An uptempo big-band sound is heard as the movie cuts to
Mickey's examination, beginning with a close-up of Dr. Abel
using an otoscope to examine the ear of a nervous Mickey.

Next is a hearing test. The film shows the doctors's hands
turning the dials on a sonometer. Mickey sits on a nearby
high stool, large earphones on his head. He listens with
such concentration that he squints his eyes. He holds up a
finger in response to the sounds he hears in his headset.

Finally, the film shows Dr. Abel hitting a large turning
fork with his finger. He puts the vibrating fork to Mickey's
ear. Mickey, looking up at the offscreen doctor's face,
nods.

The music stops as the film cuts back to Dr. Abel's
consultation room. Dr. Abel walks from the examining room,
through the consultation room, to a second examining room
across the way. He talks to the offscreen Mickey as he walks.

                      DR. ABEL
          Well, I'm sorry to say you have had
          a significant drop in the high-
          decibel range of your right ear.

                      MICKEY
              (offscreen)
          Really?!

Dr. Abel moves offscreen in the second examining room. The
camera stays focused on the doorway to this room as the doctor
and Mickey talk offscreen.

                      DR. ABEL
              (offscreen)
          Have you been exposed to a loud noise
          recently, or did you have a virus?

                                                        43.

                       MICKEY
              (offscreen)
          No, I-I've been perfectly healthy.
          You know me.

Dr. Abel briefly passes by the doorway.

                       MICKEY
              (offscreen)
          I always, I-I always imagine that I
          have things.

                      DR. ABEL
              (offscreen)
          When did you first notice this?

                      MICKEY
              (offscreen)
          Oh, uh, about a month ago.   Wha-
          what do I have?

Looking preoccupied, Dr. Abel walks back into the consultation
room, holding Mickey's open file. He strides over to his
desk, revealing a frightened Mickey, sitting in a chair
opposite it. Still standing, the doctor leans over the desk,
his back to the camera, and makes a few notes in the file.

                      DR. ABEL
          You've had some dizzy spells.
              (sighing)
          What about ringing and buzzing?
          Have you, uh, noticed any of that?

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          Yes, now-now that you mention it,
          uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also
          ringing. Ringing and buzzing.
          Um, am I going deaf, or something?

                      DR. ABEL
              (making more notes in
               the file)
          And it's just in one ear?

                      MICKEY
              (picking at his fingers)
          Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to
          have problems in both ears?

Dr. Abel chuckles as he closes Mickey's file and straightens
up. The camera looks past his back and shoulders to the
anxious Mickey.

                                                          44.

                      DR. ABEL
              (his face offscreen)
          What I'd like to do, is to make an
          appointment for you at the hospital.
          I'd like to have them run some tests.

                      MICKEY
          The hospital? What kind of tests?

Dr. Abel lays his pen across Mickey's closed file. He walks
around his desk and sits on its edge close to Mickey.

                      DR. ABEL
              (sighing)
          Now, don't get alarmed. These are
          just more sophisticated audiometry
          tests than I can run here.
              (gesturing)
          I mean, it's, it's nothing.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          Well, if it's nothing, then why do I
          have to go into the hospital at all?
          I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine,
          so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the,
          on the high decibels. So I, you
          know, I won't go to the opera.

                      DR. ABEL
              (sniffing)
          You know, there's no reason for panic.
          I just want to rule out some things.

                       MICKEY
          Like what?

                      DR. ABEL
              (shaking his head)
          It's nothing. Will you trust me?

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

Mickey stands in a telephone booth on a corner near Dr.

Abel's office; he talks on the phone. It is raining. A man
and a woman holding an umbrella pass by; traffic moves across
a nearby intersection.

                      MICKEY
              (into the telephone)
          Huh, uh, hello, Dr. Wilkes?   Dr.

                                                          45.

Wilkes, this is Mickey Sachs.   You have a minute?   I want to
ask you a question.

The film cuts to Dr. Wilkes, on the telephone at his end.

He is in his office; he leans back in his chair, dangling
his stethoscope as he speaks. Behind him, a chest X-ray is
mounted on a light panel.

                      DR. WILKES
              (into the telephone)
          Sure, Mickey. What's up?

The movie cuts back and forth between Mickey in his phone
booth asking questions and Dr. Wilkes in his office answering
them.

                      MICKEY
              (into the telephone,
               gesturing)
          I-if you have, i-if you have a hearing
          loss in one ear, and-and it's not
          from a, uh, virus or a loud noise or
          anything, wh-what are the
          possibilities?

                      DR. WILKES
              (into his telephone)
          Anything. Uh, often it's hereditary.
          Flu, uh, even a small noise will do
          it.

                      MICKEY
              (into the telephone)
          Uh, right, but-but nothing worse?

                      DR. WILKES
              (into the telephone)
          Well, yes, I guess the, uh, dark
          side of the spectrum is a brain tumor.

                      MICKEY
              (into the telephone,
               reacting with a blank
               stare)
          Really?

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Gail, wearing her glasses, stands behind a crowded but well-
ordered desk. Two assistants, a man and a woman, stand around
her.

                                                         46.

               some pages of script)
          Okay, so here's the new pages.

                      WOMAN
              (looking over the
               pages)
          Say, did cards get these?

                      GAIL
              (scratching her head)
          No, not yet. No.

                      MAN
              (looking over his
               pages)
          Well, let's hope it's good.

                      GAIL
          Yeah, really. Really.

The assistants walk off.   As they leave, Gail calls out after
them.

                      GAIL
          Eh, we'll be down in a minute, okay?

The telephone starts to ring, Gail pauses, looking offscreen.

She takes off her glasses and squints.

                      GAIL
          Mickey, what's the matter with you?
          You're all white!

The film cuts to Mickey, who is pacing and wringing his hands.
He walks over to Gail. The phone continues to ring.

                      MICKEY
          I feel dizzy. Sshh, you know, I
          don't feel well.

He starts to pant, looking worriedly around the room. He
continues to wring his hands as Gail stares at him, concerned.

                      MICKEY
          Do you hear a ringing? Is there, is
          there a, is there a ringing sound?
              (sighing)

                      GAIL
              (gesturing)
          Yeah. Yeah, yeah.    I hear, I hear
          it.

                                                 47.

She sits down and picks up the phone.

                      MICKEY
              (shaking his head)
          N-n-no, not that.

                      GAIL
              (overlapping, into
               the telephone)
          Hello?

                      MICKEY
              (covering first one
               ear, then the other,
               continuing)
          Like--
              (putting a finger
               into his ear, closing
               his eyes and listening)

                      GAIL
              (into the telephone)
          Uh, yeah, yeah. We're going to be
          working late tonight. N-no, we'll
          order out. It's all right. Yeah.

Gail hangs up the phone.

                      MICKEY
              (turning to Gail,
               gesturing nervously)
          Sssss, if I have a brain tumor, I
          don't know what I'm gonna do.
              (sighing)

                      GAIL
          You don't have a brain tumor. He
          didn't say you had a brain tumor.

                      MICKEY
              (sighing)

                       NO, NATURALLY
               (gesturing)
          they're not gonna tell you, because,
          well, you know, th--, sometimes the
          weaker ones will panic if you tell
          'em.

                       GAIL
              (pointing a finger at
               Mickey)
          But not you.

                                                             48.

                      MICKEY
              (flinging up his arms,
               sighing)
          Oh, God!
              (looking around
               worriedly and touching
               Gail's shoulder)
          Do you hear a buzzing? Is there a
          buzzing?

He pants and begins to pace around the room.    The camera
follows him as he walks away from Gail.

                      GAIL
              (impatiently)
          Mickey, come on, we got a show to
          do!

                       MICKEY
              (pacing)
          I can't keep my mind on the show.

                      GAIL
              (offscreen)
          But there's nothing wrong with you.

                      MICKEY
              (sighing and gesturing)
          If there's nothing wrong with me
              (pacing back to the
               desk and Gail)
          then why does he want me to come
          back for tests?!

                      GAIL
              (gesturing)
          Well, he has to rule out certain
          things.
              (sighing)

                        MICKEY
          Like what?!    What?

                      GAIL
              (shrugging)
          I don't know. Cancer, I--

                      MICKEY
              (interrupting)
          Don't say that! I don't want to
          hear that word!
              (gesturing)
          Don't mention that while I'm in the
          building.

                                                         49.

                      GAIL
              (gesturing)
          But you don't have any symptoms!

                       MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          You--I got the classic symptoms of a
          brain tumor!

Mickey sighs.

                      GAIL
          Two months ago, you thought you had
          a malignant melanoma.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The
          sudden appearance of a black spot on
          my back!

                      GAIL
          It was on your shirt!

                      MICKEY
              (sighing)
          I--How was I to know?!
              (pointing to his back)
          Everyone was pointing back here.

He sighs again as Gail, frustrated, gestures impatiently to
the papers on the desk.

                      GAIL
          Come on, we've got to make some
          booking decisions.

Mickey begins pacing around the room again.   He wrings his
hands and blows on them.

                      MICKEY
          I can't. I can't think of it.
          This morning, I was so happy, you
          know. Now I, I don't know what went
          wrong.
              (sighing)

                      GAIL
          Eh, you were miserable this morning!
          We got bad reviews, terrible ratings,
          the sponsors are furious...

                                                         50.

                      MICKEY
              (pacing back to the
               desk, still wringing
               his hands)
          No, I was happy, but I just didn't
          realize I was happy.

                                                     CUT TO:

The Stanislavski Catering Company in action.

Sophisticated pop music plays as the film cuts to:

INT. LOFT - DAY

An abstract painting on a wall fills the screen. Light
laughter is heard, as well as the sophisticated music;
offscreen brunch guests chatter indistinctly.

                      FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST
              (offscreen)
          These things are delicious! What in
          the world are they?

Holly walks onto the screen in front of the painting. She
holds an almost empty tray of hors d'oeuvres; she wears a
uniform.

                      HOLLY
          Oh, um, those are quail eggs.

                      FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST
              (offscreen)
          Oh, they're very good.

Holly walks past the painting towards the female brunch guest.
A man walks in front of her. Chatter, light laughter, and
music are still heard; a party is in progress.

                      HOLLY
              (nodding)
          Yeah, my friend April makes those.
              (holding out the tray)
          Here, try the shrimp puffs. These
          are delicious.

                      FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST
              (taking one from the
               tray)
          Oh, thank you. That looks great.

                      HOLLY
          I make those.

                                                         51.

                       FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST
          Mmm.   Thanks.

Holly laughs lightly as she walks away from the woman.

Holding her tray, she passes a large oval loft window and
several clusters of brunch guests. They are eating and
drinking. No one pays any attention to her.

                      HOLLY
              (to two male guests
               in her way)
          Excuse me.

One of the men, murmuring his thanks, takes a last shrimp
puff as Holly passes.

                      HOLLY
              (to the man)
          Thank you.

Holly finally makes her way into the cluttered loft kitchen.

Her tray is empty.

                      APRIL
              (offscreen)
          The Stroganoff is ready.

Holly, excited, runs over to April, who is busy taking the
Stroganoff out of the oven. She wears the same uniform as
Holly: black skirt, white shirt, and black bowtie.

                      HOLLY
              (animatedly)
          We're a big hit.

                      APRIL
          Oh, in this we're a big hit.
          Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back
          Little Sheba. That, I wasn't such a
          big hit.

April, holding the Stroganoff, dashes out of the kitchen to
serve the party guests. Holly calls after her, offscreen,
as David walks past the hurrying April into the kitchen.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          You will be. You will be.   You'll
          get five jobs next week.

David walks over to Holly, who is busy at the pot-and-pan-
covered stove.

                                                        52.

                      DAVID
              (to Holly)
          Excuse me, are there any more claims?

                      HOLLY
              (gesturing at some
               canaps warming on
               the stove)
          Only a few. A few.
              (chuckling as David
               takes one)
          Do you like 'em?

                      DAVID
          I can't resist.

                      HOLLY
              (busily working at
               the stove)
          Really? How flattering!   Did you
          try the shrimp puffs?

                      DAVID
              (eating a canap and
               pointing at Holly)
          Listen, you guys are too attractive
          to be caterers. Something's wrong.

                      HOLLY
          We're actresses.

                      DAVID
          Is this your first job?

                      HOLLY
              (grabbing a quiche
               from an overhead
               stove)
          Really? Is the food that bad?

                      DAVID
              (shaking his head)
          Oh no. Not at all.

As Holly carries the quiche outside to the party, April comes
back into the kitchen from another doorway. Music, as well
as the chatter of mingling guests, is heard in the background.

                      APRIL
          We need more bread and some baked
          lasa--
                      (MORE)

                                                         53.

                       APRIL (CONT'D)
              (realizing Holly isn't
               there and, at the
               same time, noticing
               David)
          uh, lasagne.
              (turning to David)
          Hi.

                       DAVID
              (standing by the sink
               as he wipes his hands
               and mouth with a
               napkin)
          I know. You're an actress with a
          great flair for shrimp puffs.

                      APRIL
              (working at the stove,
               pointing a finger
               for emphasis)
          Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.
          I do the, uh, crpes caviar.

She walks past David to a counter where she begins to fold
napkins. David leans back against the sink.

                      DAVID
          And the quail is responsible for the
          quail eggs.

                      APRIL
              (turning to David and
               chuckling)
          Well, let's hope so.

Holly enters the kitchen holding out a plate of clams.   She
walks over to David.

                      HOLLY
          Here, I stole you a couple of extra
          clams.

                         DAVID
                 (taking the plate)
          Ah!

                         HOLLY
                 (looking busily around
                  the room)
          Now.

                      DAVID
              (overlapping, gesturing)
          Incidentally, I'm David Tolchin.

                                                         54.

                      APRIL
              (turning to David)
          Oh, uh, April Knox. Hi.

They shake hands.

                        DAVID
                (looking at her)
          Hi.

                        APRIL
                (leaving the counter
                 and squeezing past
                 David and Holly)
          Oh.

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping, moving
               out of April's way)
          I'm sorry.

April walks offscreen to another area of the kitchen.   Holly
picks up a napkin from the crowded table.

                      DAVID
              (overlapping Holly's
               apology, turning to
               her)
          You're Holly.

                       HOLLY
              (nodding, looking at
               David as she wipes
               her hands with the
               napkin)
          Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering
          Company.

                      DAVID
          (chewing on a clam canap
          Now I'm going to tell you the truth.
          I really came in here because I was
          bored stiff by the party.

                       HOLLY
              (laughing, still wiping
               her hands)
          What makes you think we're more
          interesting?

David walks around the table, putting the plate of clams
down on the already crowded surface. Holly follows him,
chuckling, throwing her napkin into an offscreen garbage can
as David stops at a small television set near the doorway.

                                                          55.

Guests in the other room can be seen chatting together in
clusters.

                       DAVID
               (turning on the set)
          Actually, I'm going to listen to
          Aida, if I'm not getting in your
          way.

Canned laughter and miscellaneous chatter is heard from the
television set. David watches the set, still munching on a
clam, while Holly and April reassure him offscreen.

                      APRIL
              (offscreen)
          No...no. No--
              (sniffing)

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          Not at all.

David checks his wristwatch as Holly walks over to him.

                      HOLLY
              (gesturing, fiddling
               with another napkin)
          We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in
          Ernani at the Met, and I cried...

                      DAVID
              (nodding, his hand
               still on his watch
               as he looks at Holly)
          I cry at the opera.

                      APRIL
              (offscreen)
          Oh, I-I-I go limp in the last scene
          in La Traviata. Limp.

Holly chuckles as David, listening to April, impressed, walks
over to her. She is standing by the table.

                      DAVID
              (nodding, to April)
          Me, too. I have a private box at
          the Met.
              (gesturing)
          I bring my little bottle of wine, I
          open it, I sit there and I watch and
              (glancing over to the
               offscreen Holly)
          I cry. It's disgusting.

                                                           56.

April chuckles as Holly walks back onscreen; she is busy
preparing another tray of hors d'oeuvres.

                      HOLLY
              (gesturing)
          Oh, what, what do you do?

                      DAVID
              (nodding)
          I'm an architect.

                       APRIL
          Wha--
              (turning to glance at
                Holly)
          What kind of things do you build?

                      DAVID
          Are you really interested?

                      APRIL
          Yeah.

                      HOLLY
              (nodding)
          Yeah.

                      DAVID
          What time do you get off?

The three exchange glances.   Holly shrugs.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

A contemporary red building, designed by David, is seen,
squeezed in between two older buildings. Holly, April, and
David talk offscreen.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          Wow, it's the red one?

                      APRIL
              (offscreen)
          Oh, it's magnificent!

                      DAVID
              (offscreen)
          Yeah.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          It's terrific!

                                                       57.

The film moves down from the buildings to reveal the trio
sitting in David's Jaguar across the street. David and April
sit in the front seat; Holly sits scrunched up in back, her
head slightly forward.

                     DAVID
             (gesturing, looking
              back and forth from
              the buildings to
              Holly and April)
         The design's deliberately
         noncontextural. But I wanted to...
         keep the atmosphere of the street,
         you know, and the proportions.

                     HOLLY
             (nodding)
         Uh-huh.

                     DAVID
         And in the material.
         That's...that's unpolished red
         granite.
             (pausing as he watches
              Holly and April's
              reaction)

                        HOLLY
         Oh!

                     APRIL
             (overlapping)
         Oh, is that what it is?

                        HOLLY
                (starting to speak)
         Uh--

                      APRIL
             (interrupting, nodding
               at Holly)
         I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you
         know.

                     HOLLY
             (nodding, overlapping)
         Right.

                                                        58.

                      APRIL
              (looking back at the
               building with
               reverence)
          It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely
          wholly interdependent, if you know
          what I mean. I-I... I can't put it
          into words. The important thing is-
          is-is it-it breathes.

                      DAVID
              (turning to April,
               emphatically)
          You know, April, people pass by vital
          structures in this city all the time,
          and they never take the time to
          appreciate them. I get the feeling
          you tune in to your environment.

                         APRIL
                 (shaking her head)
          Oh--

                      HOLLY
              (interrupting,
               gesturing and nodding)
          Oh, it's really important.

David turns and briefly glances at Holly; he then turns back
to April.

                      APRIL
              (looking only at David)
          What are your favorite buildings,
          David?

                      DAVID
          You want to see some?

                      APRIL
              (nodding)
          Oh, yeah.

                      DAVID
          Well, let's do it.

                      APRIL
              (looking at David)
          Great.

David starts the car and the movie cuts to an unfolding visual
excursion through New York City's landmark buildings, as
seen from the trio's point of view in the moving Jaguar.

Inspiring classical music plays in the background.

                                                        59.

The series of shots includes the Dakota, complete with
surrounding winter trees, the Graybar building on Lexington
Avenue, an incredibly ornate building on Seventh Avenue and
Fifty-eighth Street, a red-stone church, an old building
with embellished, bulging windows on West Forty-fourth Street,
the Art Deco Chrysler Building, a red-brick building, Abigail
Adams's old stone house, and the Pomander Walk nestled off
Broadway on the Upper West Side. The group can be seen
walking down the path between the old-fashioned row houses
and shrubbery. A lamppost sits in the foreground.

It is now dark. The music continues to play as the film
cuts to the faade of a rococo-style building, complete with
French doors and ornate windows. The admiring group is heard
offscreen.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          Oh, it's just so romantic. I just
          want to put on a long gown...

                         DAVID
                 (offscreen, overlapping)
          Yes.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen, continuing)
          ...and open the French doors and go
          on the balcony --

                      APRIL
              (offscreen,
               interrupting)
          It's French, though.    It really is.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          Yeah.

                      APRIL
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          It feels like you're in France.

                      DAVID
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          It-it is. It's romantic.

The music stops. The screen, which has been exploring the
rococo building's faade, now shows the equally elegant
building alongside it.

                      DAVID
              (offscreen)
          And it's got a handsome partner
          sitting right beside it.

                                                        60.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          Yeah.

                      DAVID
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          They fit right in together. And
          your eye goes along, lulled into
          complacency, and then...

The film moves from the two elegant faade to show an ugly,
ultra-modern structure covered with tiny, diamond-shaped
motifs.

                      APRIL
              (offscreen)
          That's just --

                      DAVID
              (offscreen,
               interrupting)
          Look at this.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          That's disgusting!

                      APRIL
              (offscreen, continuing)
          ...a monstrosity! Who would do that?

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          It's really terrible.

                      DAVID
              (offscreen,
               emphatically)
          It's really sad.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          And it ruins everything else.

                      DAVID
              (offscreen, agreeing)
          It does.

The film moves from the ugly faade to the building's equally
ugly entrance. A large car is parked right in front of the
building.

                                                        61.

                      APRIL
              (offscreen)
          Well...we have seen a lot of stuff
          today, though.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen, chuckling)
          Yeah.

                      DAVID
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          Yeah.

                      APRIL
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          A lot of works.

The group is now seen walking down the canopied entrance
stairs of an apartment house on the other side of the street,
where they'd been gazing at both the lovely and ugly ades
across the way. David is in the lead; the women follow,
Holly slightly behind April.

                      HOLLY
              (nodding)
          Yeah.

                      DAVID
              (glancing at his watch)
          Maybe we should start thinking about
          going home, huh?

                      HOLLY
          Fast.

                      APRIL
          Oh, geez, yeah.

                      HOLLY
              (overlapped)
          Okay.

They walk towards the car.

                      DAVID
              (looking back at the
               women as he walks
               around the car to
               the driver's side)
          Uh, who gets dropped first?

                      APRIL
          Uh --

                                                        62.

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping, looking
               at April)
          Oh, gee, I don't know. Um...

                      DAVID
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          Well...

                      APRIL
              (overlapping)
          Well, I live downtown.

                      HOLLY
              (glancing at April)
          Yeah, I, we both live downtown.

David leans over the roof of the car, looking at the women,
waiting for their decision.

                      APRIL
              (gesturing)
          Uh...

                      HOLLY
              (to David)
          It depends on what way you want to
          go.

                      APRIL
              (overlapping)
          Well, wait. You know what?     I know.

                      HOLLY
          Uh...

                      APRIL
              (to Holly, gesturing)
          If...well, if we took the, if we
          took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get
          to your house first, yeah?

                      DAVID
              (overlapping, nodding)
          We could...we could do that.

                      HOLLY
              (nodding)
          Right. Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed,
          isn't it?

She looks at David.

                                                          63.

                      APRIL
              (overlapping, to Holly)
          Well, sometimes, some, uh...

                      HOLLY
              (interrupting)
          I mean, it's jammed.     If we went...
          um...

Both she and April mumble awkwardly.

                      DAVID
              (pointing to Holly,
               interrupting their
               chatter)
          Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?

                         HOLLY
                 (nodding at David)
          Yes.

                      DAVID
          Well, I-I guess if you live in
          Chelsea, that's probably first.

                      HOLLY
              (nodding nervously)
          Oh, okay.

                         APRIL
          Yeah.

                      DAVID
          And then, uh, April...huh?

                      APRIL
              (overlapping, nodding)
          Great.

They get into the car.    Once again Holly's in the backseat.

The classical music begins anew.

The movie cuts briefly to cut to the traffic and lights of a
Manhattan avenue as seen from the moving Jaguar. It then
moves to a close-up of Holly, sitting in the backseat, her
head near the window. She is staring straight ahead.

                      HOLLY (V.O.)
          Naturally I get taken home first.
          Well, obviously he prefers April.
          Of course I was so tongue-tied all
          night. I can't believe I said that
          about the Guggenheim.
                      (MORE)

                                                           64.

                      HOLLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          My stupid little roller-skating joke.
          I should never tell jokes. Mom can
          tell 'em and Hannah, but I kill 'em.
              (glaring at the
               offscreen April's
               back)
          Where did April come up with that
          stuff about Adolph Loos and terms
          like ""organic form""?
              (looking out the side
               window, pausing for
               a moment)
          Well, naturally. She went to
          Brandies.

The movie cuts to Holly's point of view: the front seat where
David and April sit, the Jaguar's windshield, and the passing
lights and traffic of the street. Holly continues her
ruminations as April leans over to say something to David.

                      HOLLY (V.O.)
          But I don't think she knows what
          she's talking about. Could you
          believe the way she was calling him
          David? ""Yes, David. I feel that
          way, too, David. What a marvelous
          space, David.""
              (emphatically)
          I hate April. She's pushy.

The film moves back to Holly in the backseat, still lost in
thought.

                      HOLLY (V.O.)
          Now they'll dump me and she'll invite
          him up. I blew it.
              (sighing, looking out
               the side window)
          And I really like him a lot. Oh,
          screw it. I'm not gonna get all
          upset. I've got reading to do
          tonight. You know, maybe I'll get
          into bed early. I'll turn to a movie
          and take an extra Seconal.

The classical music stops and some uptempo jazz begins.    The
screen cuts to black and a title appears.

""...nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands.""

                                                        CUT TO:

                                                        65.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE FREDERICK'S LOFT - DAY

The movie briefly holds on a ripped, red, paint-splattered
door as Elliot, wearing a raincoat, appears nearby. He looks
down the street and the film cuts to his point of view:
Frederick's loft building.

The movie goes back to the impatient Elliot; he's looking
around him. He glances at his watch as the film cuts back
once again to the loft building, where Lee finally appears,
walking down the street away from Elliot. A truck passes
down the street. Lee doesn't see him. She walks further
and further away; she turns a corner.

Elliot frantically looks around again; then, in a burst of
decision, he runs around a garbage dump, crossing the street,
and still running, he moves down an adjacent street, past
The Canal Lumber Company and several other buildings, as the
film cuts back to Lee, walking down a different street,
oblivious.

The jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between
the fast-moving Elliot, rushing down the SoHo streets, past
a truck waiting for a light to change, past some pedestrians,
some garbage cans, turning corners, and the strolling Lee,
walking up different streets, past different buildings.

Lee eventually crosses a street, lost in thought, looking
right and left, as Elliot, pretending nonchalance, waits on
the corner, looking at his watch. She looks up in surprise;
the music stops.

                      ELLIOT
              (trying not to sound
               out of breath)
          Oh, my goodness!

                      LEE
              (overlapping, smiling
               in surprise)
          Oh, Elliot!

                      ELLIOT
          Hi.

                      LEE
              (smiling)
          What are you doing here?

                      ELLIOT
              (looking around,
               gesturing)
          Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.

                                                   66.

                      LEE
              (shaking her head)
          Oh, what, in this section of town?

                       ELLIOT
          Yes.   Yeah, I-I'm kill--

                      LEE
              (overlapping)
          You're out looking here?

                      ELLIOT
              (glancing at his watch
               again)
          Well, yes, I'm killing time. I have
          a client near here and I...I'm quite
          early.

                      LEE
              (laughing)
          Ohhhh!

                      ELLIOT
              (gesturing)
          How about you?

                        LEE
          Oh.    Well, I live--

                       ELLIOT
               (interrupting,
                chuckling)
          Oh, yes! You live near here, don't
          you?

                      LEE
              (overlapping, chuckling)
          Yes, I do.

                      ELLIOT
              (putting his hands
               behind his back)
          Where are you headed?

                      LEE
          Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting.

                      ELLIOT
          Oh, my goodness. Well, why do you
          still go to those? You never tough
          alcohol.

They begin to walk down the street.

                                                 67.

                      LEE
              (laughing)
          Well, listen, you didn't know me
          before Frederick. I'd...I'd start
          with a beer at about ten in the
          morning, and...go on.

                      ELLIOT
              (looking at Lee)
          Oh. You must have been, uh, very
          unhappy.

                      LEE
          Yeah, unhappy and fat.
              (chuckling)
          And I still find the meetings very
          comforting, you know.

She shrugs.

                      ELLIOT
          I'll never understand it. You're so
          bright and charming and beautiful.

                      LEE
              (laughing)
          Oh, God.

                      ELLIOT
              (overlapping, chuckling)
          I think to myself
              (laughing)
          what problems could she possibly
          have?

                      LEE
              (gesturing, laughing)
          Don't let me get started on my
          childhood.
              (stopping in her
               tracks, remembering)
          Oh, you know what? There is a
          bookstore.

                         ELLIOT
                 (stopping alongside
                  her)
          Yes?

                      LEE
              (overlapping, pointing)
          A couple of blocks from here. If
          you don't know about it, you should.
          You'd really love it.

                                                        68.

                       ELLIOT
          Yes?

                      LEE
              (nodding)
          Yeah, you would.

                       ELLIOT
              (looking around for a
               moment, then gesturing
               to Lee)
          Well, i-if-if you have some free
          time...

                      LEE
              (nodding)
          Yeah, sure.
              (chuckling)

                       ELLIOT
          Thank you.

They begin to walk again as the movie cuts to the interior
of the Pageant Book & Print Shop, an old, serious bookstore.

A nude print hangs at the end of one of the library shelf-
like bookcases, which are packed, row after row, with books.

An unseen Elliot and Lee carry on a conversation as the camera
moves down an aisle, past the rows of books. A piano playing
""Bewitched"" is heard. Pictures hang on the aisle ends of
the shelves.

                      LEE
              (offscreen)
          Isn't this great?
              (chuckling)
          They have everything here.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen, distracted)
          Yes, it's-it's wonderful.

                      LEE
              (offscreen)
          What book did you want to buy?

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen)
          What? Book?

                      LEE
              (offscreen)
          Your book? You wanted to buy a book?

                                                         69.

The camera moves past another aisle of books to reveal Lee,
browsing through a shelf.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen)
          Oh, book? Oh, no, I...
              (laughing)
          I'm killing time. I...I-I just, uh,
          w-want to browse, uh...

                       LEE
              (looking up at a row
                of books)
          Well, you sure picked the right place.
          I mean, you can stay here all
          afternoon, not buy anything and just
          read.

She walks down a center aisle, the camera still in its
parallel aisle, following her.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen)
          Unless, of course, if-if you had
          some time, I mean, we could get some
          coffee.

                      LEE
          No, I don't have time.

Lee stops at the row where Elliot has been browsing. She is
hidden by a shelf; only Elliot is seen as he talks to the
offscreen Lee.

                      ELLIOT
              (gesturing)
          No, no. I-I-I understand completely.

No problem.   Y-you're busy.   I-I-I...

                      LEE
              (offscreen, chuckling)
          You seem tense. Is everything all
          right? You feel okay?

                      ELLIOT
              (overlapping)
          No! No...

                        LEE
                (offscreen)
          No?

                                                       70.

                      ELLIOT
              (gesturing, looking
               at books)
          Uh, yes!

                         LEE
                 (offscreen)
          Yes?

Elliot starts walking down the center aisle, in the same
direction Lee had walked up. He continues to talk to her as
she remains offscreen in a nearby row.

                         ELLIOT
                 (offscreen momentarily,
                  hidden by a shelf as
                  he talks)
          Yes.

                      LEE
              (offscreen)
          Everything's okay?
              (chuckling)

                        ELLIOT
          Yeah.    How are you?

                      LEE
              (offscreen)
          I'm...all right.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen momentarily,
               hidden by another
               shelf as he walks)
          How-how's Frederick?

Elliot stops walking to browse through some books.

""Bewitched"" still plays.

                      LEE
              (offscreen)
          Fine. Oh, we went to the Caravaggio
          exhibition at the Met. It's such a
          treat to go through a museum with
          Frederick. I mean...you learn so
          much. Do you like Caravaggio?

                       ELLIOT
              (turning to talk to
                the offscreen Lee)
          Oh, yes. Who doesn't?
              (pointing)
          Look!

                                                        71.

Elliot turns and walks back down the center aisle to a row
of books he'd already passed.

                       ELLIOT
              (pointing to a book
                on a shelf, continuing)
          e.e. cummings. I'd like to get you
          this.

                      LEE
              (offscreen, laughing)
          Oh, no, I can't let you get me that.
          That's too much.

                      ELLIOT
              (pulling the book off
               the shelf and browsing
               through it)
          Oh, oh, yes. I-I-I-'d like to, uh,
          uh, very much.

                      LEE
              (offscreen)
          No, I don't think so.

                      ELLIOT
              (gesturing with the
               book, looking at the
               offscreen Lee)
          I-I read a poem of you and thought
          of his last week.
              (nervously laughing,
               trying to correct
               his mistake)

                      A POEM OF
              (laughing)
          his and thought of you last--
              (laughing)
          You'll be fine, though.
              (chuckling)
          Lee walks over to Elliot in the center
          aisle. She looks at the book.

                      LEE
              (overlapping)
          Uh, uh, this is great. I mean, I
          love e.e. cummings, but I can't let
          you get this.

                      ELLIOT
              (overlapping, patting
               the book)
          Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to
          get you this.

                                                           72.

                      LEE
              (looking down at the
               book)
          Well, sure.

                      ELLIOT
              (overlapping)
          And-and maybe, um...maybe we could
          discuss it sometime.

He hands Lee the book.   She thumbs through it, as the movie

                                                       CUTS TO:

The street outside the bookstore. Lee, holding the book in
a brown bag, and Elliot are walking out.

                      LEE
              (laughing, holding up
               the bag)
          Well, thanks a lot.

                      ELLIOT
              (pointing to the
               bookstore)
          Thanks for showing me the bookstore.

Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.
Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.

                      LEE
              (nodding)
          Well, yeah, yeah. You'd love it.
          It's really entertaining. You'd
          have a good time.
              (stepping closer to
               the curb and hailing
               a cab)
          I know you would.

                      ELLIOT
              (pointing to the book)
          And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on
          page a hundred and twelve. It
          reminded me of you.

A taxi pulls over to the curb; they walk over to it.

                      LEE
              (laughing)
          Really? Well...

Elliot opens the rear door for Lee.   She laughs as she gets
in.

                                                       73.

                      ELLIOT
              (leaning down to talk
               to Lee in the cab)
          Page a hundred and twelve.

                         LEE
          Bye.

                         ELLIOT
                 (closing the taxi
                  door for Lee)
          Bye.

He watches the taxi pull away.

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. FREDERICK'S LOFT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lee, in slacks and shirt, is curled up on the bed, her back
to the camera, as she reads the e.e. cummings poem in the
glow of a night-table lamp. The piano music is still heard.

                      LEE (V.O.)
              (reading)
          ""your slightest look easily will
          unclose me though I have closed myself
          as fingers, you open always petal by
          petal myself...

As Lee continues to read aloud, the movie cuts to Elliot's
darkened den, lit by a light in the hallway. Elliot enters,
wearing a robe, crossing the room in the dark.

                      LEE (V.O.)
              (continuing reading)
          ""...as Spring opens
              (touching skillfully,
               mysteriously)
          her first rose [i do not know what
          it is about you that closes and opens;
          only something in me understands the
          voice of your eyes is deeper than
          all roses]...

Elliot turns on a light. The camera stays on his face as he
looks off into the distance, mouthing indistinctly the line
of poetry Lee next reads.

                      LEE (V.O.)
              (continuing reading)
          ""nobody, not even the rain, has such
          small hands.""

                                                           74.

The film leaves Elliot's face and cuts back to the loft,
where Lee, having finished the poem, sits up in the bed,
staring pensively, lost in her thoughts.

                                                     CUT TO:

The anxiety of the man in the booth.

Upbeat jazz begins to play and the film cuts to:

The faade of Mount Sinai Hospital. It is day. A few cars
whiz by as the film moves inside, to various scenes depicting
Mickey's comprehensive exam.

First is a hearing test, and the movie cuts to a darkened
hearing-test room. A light goes on, revealing a slouched-
over Mickey sitting in a glass booth. He is wearing a set
of headphones. The camera moves back, revealing a technician
at the console on the other side of the booth. Mickey signals
with his finger when he hears a sound on his headset.

The jazz continues.

Next is an electronystagmography (ENG). Graph paper rolls
out of a machine, and after a brief glimpse of the rolling
paper, the camera moves over to show Mickey lying terrified,
without his glasses, on a couch, with electrodes stuck all
over his head.

The film then cuts to a BSER test room, where Mickey, sitting
in a corner chair, wears another set of headphones.

An electrode is attached to his forehead; a nearby technician
sits at a computer video screen, looking at a monitoring
graph.

Last but not least is the tomography. Over the shoulders of
a technician in a booth, a large window displays a huge,
white rotating machine. It makes a whooshing noise as it
turns. The camera moves down the giant cranelike device to
reveal Mickey, once again lying down, this time on a table,
his eyes closed, underneath it.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. DR. GREY'S OFFICE - DAY

A sitting Dr. Grey, his back to the camera, is examining a
group of X-rays clipped to the light board behind his desk.

                      DR. GREY
          I wasn't too happy with the results
          of your ENG or your BSER either.

                                                           75.

The doctor turns his chair around to face a tense Mickey
sitting on the other side of his desk.

                      DR. GREY
          Uh, which is why I sent you to
          Tomography, which was all that stuff
          you saw rolling around.
              (pointing to a spot
               on one of the X-rays)
          You see this little gray area here?

Mickey stares at the X-ray, horrified.

                      DR. GREY
          That gray area's what I had hoped
          that we wouldn't run into. I'd like
          you to come in Monday morning for,
          uh, a CAT scan.

                      MICKEY
              (reacting)
          A brain scan?

                      DR. GREY
              (gesturing)
          Mr. Sachs, let's take one step at a
          time. We won't make any decisions
          until we have all the information in
          front of us, all right?

EXT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY

Mickey is seen leaving the hospital. He strides slowly, his
shoulders slouched, his hands in his pockets.

His voice is heard over the screen as he crosses the street,
continuing his self-absorbed walk on the opposite side.

Occasional traffic goes by.

                       MICKEY (V.O.)
          Okay...take it easy. He didn't say
          you had anything. He just doesn't
          like the spot on your X-ray, that's
          all. It doesn't mean you have
          anything. Don't jump to conclusions.
              (sighing)
          Nothing's gonna happen to you.
          You're in the middle of New York
          City. This is your town. You're
          surrounded by people and traffic and
          restaurants.

                                                          76.

Mickey brushes against a heavyset man who gives him a nasty
look. Mickey is so dazed, he doesn't even notice.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          I mean, God, how can you, how can
          you just one day...vanish? Keep
          calm. You're gonna be okay. Don't
          panic.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. MICKEY'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM LOFT - NIGHT

The dark bedroom is abruptly lit as Mickey, lying in his
bed, wakes up with a start and turns on his night-table lamp.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          I'm dying! I'm dying! I know it!
          There's a spot on my lungs!
              (sitting up, putting
               on his glasses)
          All right now, take it easy, will
          you? It's not on your lungs. It's
          on your ear. No, it's the same thing,
          isn't it?
              (pulling the sheets
               off and sitting on
               the edge of his bed)
          Oh, jeez, I can't sleep! Oh, God,
          there's a tumor in my head the size
          of a basketball!
              (putting on his
               slippers)
          N-now I keep thinking I can feel it
          every time I blink! Oh, Jesus!

He-he-he wants me to do a brain scan to confirm what he
already suspects.

Mickey, still ruminating, stands up. Fixing his pants, he
walks out of his bedroom loft into a dark upper hallway.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
              (running his hand
               along a banister)
          Look...I'll make a deal with God.
          Let it just be my ear, okay? I'll
          go deaf. I'll go deaf and blind in
          one eye maybe. But I don't want a
          brain operation! Once they go into
          my skull, I'll-I'll wind up like the
          guy with the, with the wool cap who
          delivers for the florist!

He walks down a spiral staircase into the dark living room.

                                                          77.

                       MICKEY (V.O.)
          Oh, relax, will ya? Your whole life
          you run to doctors. The news is
          always fine.
               (pausing at the bottom
                of the stairs)
          That's not true. What about years
          ago?

The film cuts to a flashback of Mickey's past. Dr. Smith,
sitting behind his desk, faces the camera. Rows of
periodicals line the wall behind him.

                      DR. SMITH
              (gesturing with one
               hand)
          I'm sorry to say, Mr. Sachs, that
          you cannot have children.

The camera moves to Dr. Smith's point of view: Hannah and
Mickey, sitting on the opposite side of the desk. They look
stunned.

                         MICKEY
                 (reacting, putting
                  his hands across his
                  chest)
          Gee.

                      HANNAH
              (reacting)
          Is there no chance?

                       DR. SMITH
              (getting up from his
                desk)
          Well, naturally, this doesn't mean
          that you can't have a normal sex
          life.
              (walking over to the
                opened office door
                and closing it)
          But Mr. Sachs's tests indicate that
          he is infertile. Small sperm volume
          and infertile.

The camera moves back to the stunned Mickey and Hannah,
following Dr. Smith with their eyes.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing, looking
               up at an offscreen
               Dr. Smith)
          Isn't there anything I can do?
          Push-ups or hormones?

                                                           78.

                      DR. SMITH
              (offscreen)
          I'm afraid not.

                      MICKEY
          Well, I gotta get a second opinion.

                      HANNAH
              (turning to Mickey)
          This is the second opinion.

                      MICKEY
              (shrugging)
          Well, then a third opinion.

Dr. Smith walks back to his high-backed leather chair behind
the desk and sits down. As he talks, the camera moves closer
and closer to his face.

                      DR. SMITH
          I realize this is a blow. My
          experience is that many very fine
          marriages become unstable and are
          destroyed by an inability to deal
          with this sort of problem. I hope
          you won't make too much of it. One
          can adopt children, and there are
          various artificial methods of
          fertilization.

EXT. GROVE STREET IN GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY

Mickey and Hannah walk on the sidewalk, oblivious of the
passing pedestrians. Hannah, crying, blows her nose.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          I'm so humiliated. I don't know
          what to say. I mean--

                       HANNAH
              (interrupting, wiping
               her eyes with her
               tissue)
          Could you have ruined yourself
          somehow?

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          How could I ruin myself?   What do
          you mean, ruin myself?

                                                       79.

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping, looking
               at Mickey)
          I don't know. Excessive masturbation?

                      MICKEY
          Hey, you gonna start knocking my
          hobbies? Jesus!

Hannah sobs, clutching her tissue to her face.

                      MICKEY
          Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child.

He said you could adopt one--

                      HANNAH
              (interrupting)
          Well, what about artificial
          insemination?

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          What are you talking about?

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping)
          You know, where I-I-I would get
          implanted from a-a donor.

                      MICKEY
              (reacting)
          What, by a st-stranger?

Deep in conversation, they cross a tree-lined street. They
pass a yellow wood-frame house bordered by a wrought-iron
fence.

                      HANNAH
          Yeah, they have these banks, you
          know, where they keep them frozen.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          Fro--? You want a-a defrosted kid?
          Is that your idea?

                      HANNAH
          I want to experience childbirth.

                      MICKEY
          With a, with a stranger?   With a--

                                                         80.

                       HANNAH
               (interrupting, sniffing)
          Just think about it. That's all I
          ask.

They walk offscreen and the film cuts to Hannah and Mickey's
living room. The room is brightly lit; it's cluttered with
pillows and plants. Norman and Carol, his wife, sit on the
couch drinking coffee.

                      CAROL
              (putting down her cup)
          Oh, that was a wonderful show. I
          think that's the best show you two
          ever wrote.

                      NORMAN
              (holding his cup,
               pointing emphatically)
          No, the funniest show that Mickey
          and I ever did was the one we won
          the Emmy for.

Mickey walks from the kitchen into the living room, holding
a half-eaten chocolate cake on a serving plate. The sun
pours through the windows he passes. Hannah is briefly seen
in the background, preparing more coffee in the kitchen.

                      MICKEY
          Yeah...I-I think as, I think as far
          as laughs, I mean just plain laughs,
          you know, that was probably the best
          thing that we ever did.

Mickey puts the cake down on the coffee table, which is
already crowded with assorted plants, plates, and a bamboo
tray holding utensils and napkins.

                      NORMAN
              (agreeing)
          Mm-hm.

                      CAROL
              (overlapping, her
               hands over her crossed
               knees and nodding)
          Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.
          But the show was about the two
          Frenchmen, now that was funny and it
          was warm.

Mickey sighs and flops down on an adjoining couch.   He rubs
his forehead.

                                                           81.

                      NORMAN
              (to Carol, gesturing
               with his cup)
          We got that idea on that trip to
          Paris.

                      CAROL
              (nodding)
          Right.

                         NORMAN
                 (smiling)
          Hmm?

                       CAROL
              (to the offscreen
               Hannah)
          Do you remember that summer in France?
          Hannah, you had jet lag for six
          straight weeks.

Norman chuckles.

                      MICKEY
              (sighing, almost
               mumbling)
          Yeah, but it was, you know, I guess
          we had fun when we were there and,
          you know, it's just, I--

                      NORMAN
              (overlapping, nodding)
          Mm-hm.

Hannah walks over to the group, holding a pot of coffee.

She awkwardly steps past Mickey to pour coffee for Norman
and Carol.

                      HANNAH
              (to Mickey)
          Sorry.
              (to Norman and Carol)
          Coffee? Listen, you guys, we were--
          You want some more?

                         NORMAN
                 (holding out his cup)
          Mmm.

                      HANNAH
              (refilling Norman's
               cup)
          We-we...we had something we-we really
          wanted to discuss with you.

                                                         82.

                      MICKEY
              (overlapping, coughing)
          Yeah...

Hannah refills Carol's cup. She puts the pot down on the
coffee table and sits down next to Mickey.

                      MICKEY
              (standing up and
               gesturing)
          Jeez, this is, this is, this is very
          delicate and-and I only bring this
          up amongst friends, you know.

He starts to pace. Hannah, her hands clasped near her face,
glances briefly at Carol.

                      MICKEY
              (turning to the group
               as he paces behind
               the couch)
          I mean...
              (grunting)
          this is, uh... this should not go
          any further than this room.

                      NORMAN
              (sipping his coffee)
          I'm all ears.

Hannah sighs.   Mickey pauses for a moment, collecting his
thoughts.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing and pacing)
          Hannah and I...can't have any
          children. Now I-I-I don't want to
          get into whose fault it--
              (gesturing)
          It's my fault that we can't and-
          and-and the details are too
          embarrassing to--

                      HANNAH
              (interrupting,
               nervously picking at
               her fingers)
          W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of
          discussion that we-we'd try with
          artificial insemination.

Mickey stops his pacing and looks at the group.

                                                        83.

                      MICKEY
              (putting his hands on
               his hips)
          Yeah, I'm not so sure that I, that I
          like that idea myself, anyway--

He starts to pace behind the couch anew.

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping)
          Um, I-I didn't really want to, you
          know, go to a sperm bank or something,
          have some anonymous donor.
              (gesturing at Norman
               and Carol)
          I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't
          want that.

                       MICKEY
              (pacing)
          Right. We felt that if we were gonna
          do it, that we would like somebody
          who we knew and who we liked and who
          was warm and bright and...

Norman and Carol remain silent.

                      HANNAH
          And you can say no... you know.
          Feel free to say no. W-we realize
          it has all kinds of implications.

Mickey stops pacing and leans on the couch behind Norman.

                      MICKEY
          Yeah, but the-the point that, uh,
          that we're making here is that we
          need some sperm.

Mickey, rubbing his hands on his knees, leans back against
the wall. Norman and Carol turn to each other, reacting.

                         NORMAN
                 (sighing)
          Gee.
              (chuckling)
          Well... My first reaction after the
          initial shock is, uh, flattered that
          you would ask me.
              (chuckling nervously)
          Carol glances at Norman.

                                                84.

                      MICKEY
              (pointing at himself)
          Yeah, well, I would be the father.
              (pointing to Norman)
          You would just have to masturbate
          into a little cup.

                      NORMAN
              (shrugging)
          I can handle that.

                       HANNAH
              (scooting closer to
               Carol and Norman on
               the couch, gesturing)
          Obviously we wou-wouldn't have
          intercourse.

She chuckles nervously.

                      CAROL
              (to Hannah, chuckling
               nervously briefly)
          Gosh, listen.
              (rubbing her nose)
          I've gotta tell you the truth here.
          I'm a little uneasy about this.

                      HANNAH
              (putting her hand on
               Carol's shoulder)
          Carol, I know it's a lot to ask.

                      CAROL
              (gesturing)
          Well...I feel for you. I do.
          I...I'm gonna cry. You want my
          husband to have a child with you?

                      HANNAH
              (gesturing)
          Ye-- D-d-d-don't answer now. Just,
          you know, take it home and think
          about it for a while.

                      NORMAN
              (holding his coffee
               cup, thoughtful)
          I gave blood before and, uh...
          clothing to the poor.

                                                           85.

                      CAROL
              (to Norman, scratching
               her ear)
          Okay, Norman, listen, I really want
          to talk about this at home.
              (nodding as Hannah
               looks briefly
               offscreen at Mickey)
          I think it's a matter for your
          analyst...and mine.

                      NORMAN
              (emphatically)
          And maybe my lawyer.

He takes a sip of coffee.

                      HANNAH
              (gesturing)
          You know, we-we understand completely
          if, you know, if you feel you'd-you'd
          rather not.
              (chuckling nervously)
          I didn't mean to spoil the evening.
              (rubbing her hands)
          Now let's move on to another topic.

Hannah reaches for the cake as Carol and Norman exchange
glances, reacting.

The flashback ends. Mickey is back in the present in his
darkened living room, illuminated by a glow from a window
behind the couch. A coffee table sits in front of the couch.

Papers are scattered on the floor. Mickey gets up from the
couch where he'd been sitting. He paces back and forth as
he talks over the screen.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          So you had my ex-partner's baby.
          Twins. Maybe that did cause some
          trouble, but--
              (sighing)
          I think we were drifting apart anyhow.
          Now instead of man and wife we're
          just good friends. Boy, love is
          really unpredictable.

                                                     CUT TO:

                                                          86.

INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

Manon Lescaut is being performed. Onstage, the soprano in
the title role sings a mournful aria as she kneels by the
ruins of a wagon. The background is dark. The film moves
up to the private boxes in the upper loge. David and Holly
can be seen from a distance sitting in one of the boxes.

David glances at her; he reaches down for a bottle of wine.

The movie briefly cuts back to the stage. The soprano is
leaning on a wagon wheel; her voice soars. Then it's back
to a closer look at Holly and David in their box. The aria
continues as David hands a smiling Holly a glass. He uncorks
the wine and pours some in both their glasses.

Holly mouths a thank you, glancing around. They look at
each other and raise their glasses in a toast.

                                                     CUT TO:

Dusty bought this huge house in Southampton.

The opera audience is heard cheering, applauding, and sounding
their ""Bravos.""

The clapping stops as the movie cuts to Frederick's loft.

It is day. Lee, wearing a baggy plaid shirt and jeans, has
opened the door for Elliot and his client, wealthy rock star
Dusty Frye.

                       ELLIOT
              (leading the way into
                the loft, gesturing)
          Lee, Frederick...say hello to Dusty
          Frye.

Lee closes the door behind the men and walks over to Dusty.

                      LEE
              (shaking Dusty's hand)
          Hi, Dusty.

                      DUSTY
          Hi.

Lee chuckles as she looks at him; he is wearing sunglasses,
a red-imprinted T-shirt, and a baggy coat. She turns and
walks with Frederick, Elliot, and Dusty farther into the
loft, her hands clasped behind her back.

                                                        87.

                      ELLIOT
              (as he walks)
          Dusty's just bought a huge house in
          Southampton and he's in the process
          of decorating it.

                      DUSTY
          Yeah. It's kind of a weird place,
          actually. A lotta wall space.
              (chuckling)

                      LEE
          Oh.

They walk into the living room area of the loft, where
Frederick, his hands in his pockets, neatly attired in vest
sweater and white shirt, stands, waiting.

                      DUSTY
              (to Frederick, giving
               him a ""hip"" handshake)
          How ya doin', man?

                      ELLIOT
              (to a less than
               enthusiastic Frederick)
          I told him about your work, and he's
          very excited.

                      DUSTY
          Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol. And I
          got a Frank Stella, too. Oh, it's
          very beautiful.
              (gesturing)
          Big, weird...you know.
              (chuckling as he
               crosses his arms on
               his chest)
          If you stare at that Stella too long,
          the colors just seem to float.
          It's kinda weird.

Frederick covers his face to hide his disgust.

                      LEE
              (chuckling, her arms
               crossed)
          Are you excited about becoming a
          collector?

                      DUSTY
          Yeah.

                                                        88.

                      LEE
              (nodding)
          Yeah?

                      DUSTY
              (shrugging)
          I got a lot more to learn, though.
          I really wasn't into art when I was
          a kid.

                      LEE
              (nodding)
          Uh-huh.

                      FREDERICK
              (addressing but not
               looking at Dusty)
          Do you appreciate drawings?

                       DUSTY
              (shrugging)
          Yeah.
              (chuckling as he
                notices and points
                to some offscreen
                drawings Frederick
                has set up)
          Oh! Hey! Wow!
              (pointing to an
                offscreen nude drawing)
          She's beautiful. But, uh, really, I-
          I-I-I need something... I'm looking
          for something big.

As Dusty talks, the camera follows Elliot, who walks past
the others to examine the drawings more closely. Two framed
nude drawings of Lee are propped up on an easel. Elliot
glances admiringly at the drawings, then surreptitiously at
Lee, admiring her body as she converses with an offscreen
Dusty and Frederick.

                      LEE
              (looking at an
               offscreen Frederick,
               gesturing)
          Big. Frederick, show him the oils.

                      FREDERICK
              (offscreen)
          They're in the basement.

The camera leaves Elliot to follow the enthusiastic Lee as
she takes Dusty by the arm and starts leading him to the
door. Frederick follows at a distance.

                                                       89.

                     LEE
             (to Dusty)
         Frederick's done this whole new series
         that I'm sure you would really love.

                     DUSTY
             (overlapping, muttering)
         Well, are...are they big?

                     LEE
         Yeah. Some of them...yeah, some of
         them are very big.

                     DUSTY
         'Cause I got a lot of wall space
         there.
             (chuckling)

                     FREDERICK
             (angrily stopping in
              his tracks)
         I don't sell my work by the yard!

                     LEE
             (chuckling, reacting)
         Oh, Frederick!

The camera now moves back to Elliot, still staring at the
nude drawings, as the sounds of Frederick's and Dusty's
footsteps are heard leaving the loft. He turns and hesitantly
smiles to an offscreen Lee.

                     ELLIOT
             (chuckling softly)
         How's everything?

                     LEE
             (walking onscreen
              towards Elliot)
         Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah
         this morning on the phone, and she
         said that you two might be going to
         the country for the weekend.

                     ELLIOT
         Yeah, she loves to go out in the
         woods.

                     LEE
             (nodding, her arms
              clasped around her
              chest)
         Oh, yeah.

                                                        90.

                         ELLIOT
                 (chuckling)
             But I go nuts. It's a conflict.

He laughs.    Lee, uneasy, looks down.

                         LEE
             I have to get my teeth cleaned this
             week.

                         ELLIOT
             Oh, that's nice.

There's an awkward moment of silence.

                         ELLIOT
                 (breaking the silence,
                  pointing in the
                  direction of the
                  door)
             I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and
             Dusty together.

                         LEE
                 (looking in the same
                  direction, gesturing)
             Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.

                        ELLIOT
             Yes. This kid, he's earned a trillion
             dollars.

                           LEE
                   (nodding, wrapping
                    her arms around her
                    chest again)
             Oh.

                         ELLIOT
             He's got like six gold records.

                         LEE
                 (gesturing, relieved
                  that she's found
                  something to say)
             Oh, speaking of records...I bought
             that Mozart Trio you recommended...

The camera follows Lee as she walks quickly to the stereo
unit, pulling a record off the shelf.

                                                        91.

                      LEE
              (continuing)
          ...and the man in the record shop
          showed me another one that I think
          you'd love. It's a... another Bach,
          second movement.

She pulls the record out of its jacket and puts it on the
turntable.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen)
          Oh, you-you have that one?

                       LEE
              (working at the stereo,
                turning her head
                towards Elliot)
          Yeah.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen)
          Oh, I would love to hear it.

Bach's Concerto for Harpsichord fills the room.

                      LEE
              (putting the turntable
               cover in place)
          Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man
          who loves opera. An architect.

                       ELLIOT
               (offscreen)
          Oh, that's nice. I'd love to see
          her wind up settled. She's a tense
          one.
               (chuckling)
          The record in place, Lee turns and
          leans back against the stereo unit.
          She listens to the music, her eyes
          closed.

The record plays for a few moments in the quiet room, as
Elliot walks over to Lee and leans against the shelf near
her.

                      LEE
              (intently)
          Isn't that beautiful?

                                                           92.

                      ELLIOT
              (looking at Lee, his
               hands clasped in
               front of him)
          I know this. Bach. F Minor Concerto.
          It's one of my favorites.

Lee, smiling, continues to listen to the music, her head
down; Elliot stares at her.

                      ELLIOT
              (after a pause)
          Uh...did you ever get around to e.e.
          cummings?

                      LEE
              (wrapping her arms
               around her chest and
               looking away from
               Elliot for a moment)
          Yes, he's just adorable.

Elliot nods.

                      LEE
              (awkwardly)
          They have a very large gay clientele,
          you know, where I get my teeth
          cleaned, and...all the hygienists
          now wear gloves because they're afraid
          of AIDS.

                      ELLIOT
              (taking a breath)
          Oh, right.

There is another moment of silence. Elliot stares at Lee,
who continues to look down, her arms around her chest. The
harpsichord plays on.

                       ELLIOT
              (softly)
          Did you ever get around to the poem
          on page a hundred and twelve?

                      LEE
          Yes, it made me cry
              (tentatively looking
               at Elliot)
          it was so beautiful...so romantic.

Lee looks down again; the music plays softly and Elliot
continues to stare at her, thinking.

                                                           93.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          I want so badly to kiss her. Not
          here, you idiot. You've got to get
          her alone someplace.

As Elliot's thoughts are heard over the scene, Lee glances
around the loft, then begins to walk away. The camera follows
her as she goes past the nude drawings, which become the
focus of attention as Lee walks offscreen.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          But I've got to proceed cautiously.
          This is a very delicate situation.
          Okay, uh...ask her if you can see
          her for lunch or a drink tomorrow.

Lee walks back onscreen, to the bookshelf behind the drawings.

She takes the e.e. cummings book from the shelf and flips
through it as she walks back to Elliot, who is still leaning
by the stereo, still ruminating.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          And be ready to make light of the
          offer if she's unresponsive. This
          has to be done very skillfully, very
          diplomatically.

                      LEE
              (showing Elliot a
               poem in her book)
          Did you ever read this one--?

Elliot leaps up, grabs Lee, and kisses her passionately.

Lee, surprised, pushes him away.

                        LEE
          Elliot!    Don't!

                         ELLIOT
          Lee!    Lee!   Lee, I'm in love with
          you.

He kisses Lee again. He clumsily turns around; she humps
against the stereo unit. As Lee pulls away, she smashes
into the turntable. The needle scratches loudly. Lee,
shocked, is gasping. The record, pushed to a different part
of the concerto, now plays a more complicated, faster fugue.

                         ELLIOT
                 (breathing hard)
          Oh!

                                                        94.

                      LEE
              (gasping)
          What are you doing?!

                      ELLIOT
              (frantically)
          I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry. I have
          to talk to you for... There's so
          much that I want to tell you.

Lee stares at Elliot in shock.

                      LEE
              (still gasping)
          Elliot!

                      ELLIOT
              (gesturing desperately)
          I have been in love with you for so
          long.

Frederick and Dusty's indistinct voices, raised in argument,
are suddenly heard. Elliot quickly turns away from Lee.

She tries to compose herself and the film cuts to the loft
entranceway. Frederick enters the loft first, followed by a
confused Dusty. They stride across the loft past Lee, who
is standing by the stereo. Elliot, standing near the nude
drawings, is looking through a book.

                      FREDERICK
              (angrily)
          Please forget it! I don't have any
          interest in selling anything!

                      DUSTY
              (gesturing)
          I ask you if you have something with
          a little puce in it, you gotta fly
          off the handle!

                      LEE
              (in a slightly higher-
               pitched voice)
          What's the problem?

                      FREDERICK
              (pulling the nude
               drawings off his
               easel angrily)
          I'm not interested in what your
          interior decorator would think, okay?!

                                                       95.

                     DUSTY
             (overlapping, gesturing)
         Well, I can't commit to anything
         without consulting her first.
         That's what I have her for, okay?

                     FREDERICK
             (carrying the drawings
              off)
         This is degrading! You don't buy
         paintings to blend in with the sofa!

                     DUSTY
             (looking after
              Frederick)
         It's not a sofa, it's an ottoman!
             (touching his forehead,
              turning to Elliot)
         God, forget it! Let's just get outta
         here, Elliot.

                     ELLIOT
             (putting down the
              book)
         We'll go.

The film moves outside the loft building. Dusty and Elliot
emerge and walk to Dusty's waiting limousine. Elliot is
rubbing his forehead, anguished.

                     DUSTY
             (angrily, getting
              into the car)
         What a weirdo that guy is! Paranoid.
             (noticing Elliot's
              anguished face)
         What's the matter with you?

                     ELLIOT
             (gesturing)
         Look I-I-I'll be okay.   I'll be okay.

                     DUSTY
             (overlapping)
         It's not that big a deal.   We just
         didn't hit it off.

                     ELLIOT
             (gesturing)
         Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.

                     DUSTY
         Are you okay? You look-- You're
         sweatin'.

                                                          96.

                      ELLIOT
              (overlapping, nervously)
          Yeah. Yeah, I just-just need so-
          some-some fresh air. It's probably
          something I ate. I'll-I'll walk.
          You go ahead.

Dusty settles down in the backseat and closes the door.

Elliot leans down to the chauffeur's window, signaling for
him to start driving.

                      ELLIOT
              (continuing, gesturing)
          You go. Go on. Go.

The limousine drives off. Elliot runs to a phone booth across
the street. He picks up the phone and dials.

The film cuts to Frederick in his loft, standing near the
phone. It rings. Frederick picks it up.

                      FREDERICK
              (into the telephone)
          Hello? Hello? Hello?

When no one answers, Frederick, reacting, hangs up, and the
film moves back outside to the phone booth, where Elliot,
the phone receiver to his ear, listens for a moment, then
hangs up. He walks out of the booth, reacting, then walks
down the sidewalk, where he bumps into a frantic Lee, just
turning the corner.

                      LEE
              (gesturing in relief)
          Oh! There you are!

Elliot mumbles, relieved and confused.

                      LEE
          I was looking for you.

                      ELLIOT
              (gesturing)
          I, I must apologize. I-I'm, I-I'm
          sorry. I'm so mixed up.

                      LEE
              (gesturing)
          Well, how do you expect me to react
          to such a thing?

Elliot, uneasy, glances up in the direction of Frederick's
loft. He leads Lee a few yards up the street, away from any
prying eyes.

                                                     97.

                         ELLIOT
                 (taking Lee's arm)
             Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am
             in love with you.

                         LEE
             Oh, don't say those words!

                         ELLIOT
                 (overlapping, shaking
                  his head)
             I-I, I'm sorry. I know it's terrible.

                         LEE
                 (pushing back her
                  hair, shaking her
                  head hopelessly)
             Why, you know the situation.

She sighs.

                          ELLIOT
                 (looking away for a
                  moment)
             I know! I-I-I-I, I realize.

                         LEE
             What do you expect me to say?

                         ELLIOT
             Hannah and I are in the last stages.

                         LEE
                 (shaking her head)
             Wh-- She's never said anything, and
             we're very close. She'd tell me
             such a thing.

                         ELLIOT
             Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad.
             She's crazy about me, but somewhere
             on the, along the line, I've fallen
             out of love with her.

                         LEE
             Not because of me, I hope.

                         ELLIOT
             Oh, no, no.
                 (nodding)
             Well, yes! I love you.

                         LEE
             Oh, I can't be the cause of anything
             between you and Hannah. I jus--

                                                 98.

                      ELLIOT
              (overlapping, shaking
               his head)
          Oh, no, no, no. It, uh, it-it-it-
          it was i-inevitable that Hannah and
          I part, anyway.

                      LEE
          Why?

                      ELLIOT
          Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.

                      LEE
              (gesturing)
          But not over me?

                      ELLIOT
          Tch, no! We were, we were both going
          in different directions.

                       LEE
              (looking down)
          Poor Hannah.

                      ELLIOT
          But-but, but how about you? Do you,
          do you share any of my feelings?
          Or is this just an unpleasant
          embarrassment to you?

                      LEE
              (reacting uneasily)
          I can't say anything!

                      ELLIOT
          W-well, please be candid. I, I-I
          don't want you to feel bad.

                      LEE
              (putting her hand to
               her head)
          Yes! But I...I have certain feelings
          for you, but don't make me say
          anything more, all right?

Lee looks at him.

                      ELLIOT
              (gesturing)
          O-o-o-okay, Lee. Okay, okay. You,
          you, y-you've said enough. It's my
          responsibility now. I will work
          things out.

                                                           99.

                         LEE
             Look, don't do anything on my behalf.
                 (shaking her head)
             I live with Frederick, and Hannah
             and I are close.

                         ELLIOT
             Yes, but you, you do care about me.

                         LEE
                 (reacting)
             Oh, Elliot, please! I can't be a
             party to this! I'm suddenly wracked
             with guilt just standing her talking
             to you on the street!

She sighs.

                         ELLIOT
                 (emphatically)
             Your guilt is because you feel the
             same.

                         LEE
                 (reacting)
             Oh, please, I have to go.   I have to
             get my teeth cleaned.

She walks off.    Elliot stares after her, grinning.

                         ELLIOT
                 (happily)
             I have my answer. I have my answer!
             I'm walking on air!

He laughs.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. STREET CORNER OUTSIDE EVAN AND NORMA'S APARTMENT

BUILDING - DAY

A taxi turns a West Side street corner and stops in front of
Evan and Norma's building, which is decorated with a long
metal awning. It's an overcast day.

A station wagon on the opposite side of the street pulls
away as Hannah, a white scarf fluttering over her shoulder,
gets out of the cab. She runs into the building; the taxi
drives away. A piano plays ""Bewitched"" over the screen.

                                                        CUT TO:

                                                        100.

INT. EVAN AND NORMA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Evan, his back to the camera, walks to the front door and
opens it to Hannah.

                      HANNAH
              (distracted)
          Hi. How's she doing?

                      EVAN
              (overlapping)
          I am glad to see you.

Hannah takes off her shoulder bag and her coat as her
aggravated father walks past her towards the kitchen.   He
passes a wall with an ornate mirror and some framed
photographs.

                      EVAN
          She's in the kitchen there. It's
          the same thing. Same thing. She
          promises, promises.
              (gesturing)
          But it's all lies.

Through a doorway, Norma can be seen sitting on a chair in
the kitchen. She wears a robe over a slip and stockings;
she's drinking. Evan stands in the doorway looking at her;
he doesn't go in.

                      HANNAH
              (offscreen, patiently)
          Don't make it worse, Dad.

                      EVAN
              (overlapping)
          Always.

Hannah hurriedly passes her father and enters the kitchen;
her mother takes a sip of her drink.

                      HANNAH
          Hi, Mom. How you doing? Here, let
          me get you some coffee. That's enough
          of that.
              (taking away her
               mother's drink, to
               Evan)
          What triggered it?

                                                       101.

                      EVAN
              (gesturing, as Norma
               turns her head and
               watches him)
          We were making a commercial down at
          the mayor's office, and there was
          this young, good-looking salesman...

Norma reacts, turning to her daughter. Hannah, however, has
her back turned. She is busy taking charge in the kitchen
as Evan speaks. She takes some pills out of a cupboard and
hands them to her mother with a glass of water.

                      EVAN
              (continuing)
          ...and your mother was throwing
          herself at him in a disgusting way,
          and when she found she was too old
          to seduce him, that he was just
          embarrassed by her--

                      NORMA
              (angrily interrupting,
               turning her head)
          Liar! Liar!

The camera moves to Evan, who continues to tell his story,
ignoring his wife's outburst, as he walks away from the
kitchen doorway into the den.

                      EVAN
          Then at lunch she got drunker and
          drunker
              (shouting over his
               shoulder)
          and finally she became Joan Collins!

Evan walks over to the piano, where several framed family
photographs sit in a line on its top. He picks one up as
Norma speaks offscreen in the kitchen.

                      NORMA
              (offscreen)
          All my life I've had to put up with
          insults...

The camera moves back to the kitchen as Norma talks. She is
still glaring offscreen at the doorway where Evan stood
moments before. She holds the water glass and the pills.

                                                       102.

                      NORMA
              (continuing,
               dramatically)
          from this non-person, this, th-th-
          this haircut that passes for a man.
              (turning to look at
               the offscreen Hannah)
          He could never support us. It's a
          good thing we had a talented daughter!

Evan is back in the doorway, listening to Norma, getting
more and more angry. As he makes a retort, he starts to
walk back to the den and his piano.

                      EVAN
          I can only hope that she was mine.
          With you as her mother
              (gesturing, his voice
               getting louder)
          her father could be anybody in Actors'
          Equity!

                       NORMA
          She's talented...so it's not likely
          she's yours!
              (taking a sip of water)

                      HANNAH
              (walking over to the
               doorway to speak to
               Evan, who's already
               fuming in the den)
          Dad, could you just please stay in
          the other room and let me take care
          of her?

Hannah goes back to Norma; she takes the glass of water away.

                      EVAN
              (offscreen, choosing
               to ignore Hannah's
               suggestion)
          You never know when she's going to
          fall off the wagon and humiliate
          everybody.

Hannah, choosing to ignore Evan's remark, hands her mother a
cup of coffee; she puts her mother's hands on the cup.

                      HANNAH
          Here, Mom. Drink this.
              (leaning against a
               kitchen counter)
          You know, you're awful.   You probably
          were flirting.

                                         103.

            NORMA
    (sipping her coffee)
No! I like to joke around and have
fun, and he gets angry because I get
the attention. He's gotten sourer
as he's gotten older, and I've tried
to stay young...at heart.

            HANNAH
You promised to stay on the wagon.

            NORMA
    (shaking her head)
The sacrifices I've made because of
that man.
    (inhaling)
He's ruined me with his ego, his
philandering, his--
    (gesturing)
his-his-his-his mediocrity!

            HANNAH
Okay, stop being so dramatic.

            NORMA
    (shouting to the
     offscreen Evan)
He's the one that's made every ingenue
in stock!

            HANNAH
    (quietly)
Okay, okay.

             NORMA
    (touching Hannah's
     arm, gasping)
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a
screen test.

            HANNAH
    (patiently)
Yeah, I know, Mom.

            NORMA
    (gesturing)
But I, I knew that he'd get up there
and he'd flounder around with his
expensive haircuts and hairdos and
clothes. He's all show!
    (touching Hannah's
     arm again, then
     touching her chest)
Now how can you act when there's
nothing inside to come out?!

                                                          104.

Norma sips her coffee, softly sobbing. Hannah, reacting,
walks away from the counter and, capping the bottle of pills,
puts them back in the cupboard. Evan plays the piano
offscreen. The camera moves in on Hannah's face as she
reflects, her voice heard over the screen.

                      HANNAH (V.O.)
          She was so beautiful at one time,
          and he was so dashing. Both of them
          just full of promise and hopes that
          never materialized.

The camera leaves Hannah's face as she continues to reflect;
it moves to the den, to the row of family photos on the piano:
one of a present-day Evan and Norma, others where both Norma
and Evan are young, beautiful, hopeful. The music plays on.

                      HANNAH (V.O.)
          And the fights and the constant
          infidelities to prove themselves...and
          blaming each other. It's s-sad.
          They loved the idea of having us
          kids, but raising us didn't interest
          them much. But it's impossible to
          hold it against them. They didn't
          know anything else.

The film cuts back to the kitchen. Norma stands up; Hannah
takes her coffee cup and sets it on the counter.

                      NORMA
          You know, of all of us in the family,
          you were the one blessed with the
          true gift.

She puts her arm around Hannah's shoulder.   Mother and
daughter walk out of the kitchen.

                      HANNAH
              (holding the hand her
               mother had placed on
               her shoulder)
          Ohhh, my true gift is luck, Mom.

Norma chuckles.

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping)
          I just had a lot of luck...from my
          first show, you know? I've always
          thought Lee was the one destined for
          great things.

                                                         105.

                         NORMA
             Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't
             have your spark.
                 (gesturing and
                  chuckling)
             She knows it. She worships you.
             She wouldn't dare get up there on
             the stage.

                         HANNAH
                 (looking at her mother)
             Now, Holly's not shy.

They stop at the entrance to the den. Evan can be seen
playing the piano as they continue their conversation.

                         NORMA
             No, Holly's game for anything.
             Holly takes after me.

                         HANNAH
             True.

                         NORMA
                 (shaking her head)
             I'd have been a great dope addict.

Norma chortles. Hannah laughs, touching her mother.   They
walk over to Evan at the piano.

                         EVAN
                 (looking up)
             Remember this, Hannah?

Evan plays a few bars of ""You Are Too Beautiful"" as mother
and daughter, their backs to the camera, listen. Norma leans
over the piano; Hannah looks off into the distance, deep in
reflection. The piano music continues in the

background as the movie cuts to:

Lee walking along a wharf by the waterfront. The wind blows
her hair; she hugs the e.e. cummings book to her chest.

She, too, is deep in thought. She stops at the edge of the
wharf; the camera continues to move, to a group of wooden
pilings nearby, lapped by the water.

                                                      CUT TO:

The abyss.

The piano piece ends and the film is quiet.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL CAT-SCAN ROOM - DAY

The quiet continues as the film cuts to a close-up of a large,
circular CAT-scan module in an antiseptic hospital room. A
slowly moving stretcher, bearing Mickey's strapped prone
body, begins to enter the round opening of the module.

As the camera pulls back from Mickey, his taped head under
the scan, two technicians can be seen through the window
separating the scanner from the control room. One of them,
sitting down, taps information into a computer while the
other technician stands nearby, looking from Mickey to the
computer screen.

The movie then cuts briefly to the computer screen, showing
an image of Mickey's skull. Scan lines bleep over the skull.

The camera moves up from the screen to reveal Mickey once
again, as seen through the window, silent and serious under
the CAT-scan module.

From Mickey's prone form, the film moves to the two
technicians, as seen through the window in the scanner room.

They examine the computer screen and talk indistinctly to
each other. One of the men, nodding, taps more information
into the computer.

While they're studying the CAT-scan picture, the camera cuts
to a back view of Mickey under the module. There is a science-
fiction feel to this scene, as if Mickey is lying in the
center of a huge, white, futuristic circle. The stretcher,
bearing Mickey, slowly moves out of the module.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. DR. BROOK'S OFFICE - DAY

Dr. Brooks, holding Mickey's X-rays, walks past a row of
bookshelves to his light panel. He props up the X-rays.

                      DR. BROOKS
          Mr. Sachs,
              (sighing)
          I'm afraid the news is not good.

Dr. Brooks turns to an offscreen Mickey.

                       DR. BROOKS
              (continuing, taking a
               pencil out of his
               pocket)
          If I can show you exactly where the
          tumor is, and why we feel that surgery
          would be of no use.

                                                       107.

The film quickly cuts to a close-up of Mickey's face, reacting
in total despair. He closes his eyes; he covers his face
with his hand.

                       MICKEY (V.O.)
          It's over.   I'm face-to-face with
          eternity.

                      DR. BROOKS
              (offscreen)
          ...grown quite large without being
          detected...
              (trailing off
               indistinctly as Mickey
               continues his
               anguished ramblings)

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          Not later, but now. I'm so frightened
          I can't move, speak, or breathe.

As Mickey finishes his speech, the ""real"" Dr. Brooks is seen
walking into the office. The previous scene had been a
figment of Mickey's imagination, a nightmare fantasy only.

Holding Mickey's X-rays, the ""real"" Dr. Brooks walks past
the same row of books to the light panel.

                        DR. BROOKS
          Well, you're just fine. There's
          absolutely nothing here at all.
          And your tests are all fine.
               (switching on the
                light on the panel
                and propping up the
                X-rays)
          I must admit, I was concerned, given
          your symptoms.
               (turning to look at
                the offscreen Mickey)
          What caused this hearing loss in one
          ear, I guess we'll never really know
          for sure. But whatever it was, it's
          certainly not anything serious at
          all.
               (nodding)
          I'm very relieved.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY

Once again, Mickey is seen leaving the building, but this
time he bounds down the steps, jumping for joy. He runs
swirling down the street, clapping his hands, happy with
relief. Upbeat, uptempo jazz plays in the background.

Several cars pass as Mickey joyfully runs.     Suddenly he stops,
his hand to his mouth, reflecting.

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Gail sits in a chair in front of a bookshelf. A sofa, a
coffee table holding periodicals, and an endtable with a
lamp complete the tableau. Gail's hands are clasped on her
lap.

                      GAIL
          What do you mean you're quitting?
          Why? The news is good! You don't
          have canc--the thing.

Mickey, standing behind his desk, his back to the camera,
his coat still on, looks out at the Manhattan skyline.

                      MICKEY
          Do you realize what a thread we're
          all hanging by?

                      GAIL
              (offscreen)
          Mickey, you're off the hook.   You
          should be celebrating.

                       MICKEY
              (walking around to
               the front of his
               desk, gesturing)
          Can you understand how meaningless
          everything is? Everything! I'm
          talking about nnnn--our lives, the
          show...the whole world, it's
          meaningless.

                      GAIL
              (gesturing)
          Yeah...but you're not dying!

                      MICKEY
          No, I'm not dying now, but, but
                      (MORE)

                                                       109.

                      MICKEY (CONT'D)
              (gesturing)
          you know, when I ran out of the
          hospital, I, I was so thrilled because
          they told me I was going to be all
          right. And I'm running down the
          street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause
          it hit me, all right, so, you know,
          I'm not going to go today.
          I'm okay. I'm not going to go
          tomorrow.
              (pointing)
          But eventually, I'm going to be in
          that position.

Gail gets up from her chair. She walks past Mickey to a
nearby cabinet. She opens a drawer, rummaging around for
something. The camera follows her, leaving Mickey briefly.

                      GAIL
          You're just realizing this now?

                      MICKEY
              (offscreen)
          Well, I don't realize it now, I know
          it all the time, but, but I managed
          to stick it in the back of my mind...

As Mickey continues to talk offscreen, Gail closes the cabinet
drawer and walks to a file cabinet behind Mickey's desk.

                      MICKEY
          ...because it-it's a very horrible
          thing to... think about!

Gail opens the file cabinet and takes out a pack of gum.

She slams it closed, distracted.

                      GAIL
              (muttering)
          Yeah. What?

                      MICKEY
              (turning to Gail)
          Can I tell you something?   Can I
          tell you a secret?

              (nodding impatiently
               as she walks around
               the desk)
          Yes, please.

         told me that I had a tumor, I was
         going to kill myself. The only thing
         that mighta stopped me, might've, is
         my parents would be devastated. I
         would, I woulda had to shoot them,
         also, first. And then, I have an
         aunt and uncle, I would have... You

         Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything
         for you? That makes everything...

Gail sighs. She pops a piece of gum into her mouth as Mickey
continues to speak.

                     MICKEY

Mickey sighs.

               his head)
          I'm telling you, I'm going to do
          something drastic.

                                                     CUT TO:

The entrance to the St. Regis Hotel, elegant and warmly lit
in the night. Pedestrians pass. Baroque harpsichord music
plays over the scene. The camera moves up the hotel's ade,
past its welcoming flags, to its ornate windows several floors
up.

As the harpsichord continues to play, the film moves inside,
to one of the hotel rooms. Elliot, his back to the camera,
is opening the door to Lee.

Elliot closes the door behind her as she enters. They stand
very close to each other, framed by the door and a stark,
subtly striped wallpapered wall.

                      ELLIOT
              (looking intensely at
               Lee, his hands in
               his pockets)
          I thought you weren't coming.

                      LEE
          I almost didn't.

                       ELLIOT
              (putting his hand on
               her shoulder, wanting
               to kiss her)
          Lee... uh...

                                                        112.

                      LEE
          I didn't sleep all night.

                      ELLIOT
              (taking his hand away,
               gesturing to the
               room)
          No, no-no-no, I'm sure.

They walk towards the camera, further into the room.   Elliot
puts his arm around Lee.

                      LEE
          What are we doing, meeting in a hotel
          room? It's terrible, isn't it?

The music stops. The camera follows Lee as she walks towards
the curtained windows, past a fireplace, a mirror, some
innocuous pictures, a delicate table holding a lamp, the
foot of the bed.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen)
          I-I couldn't think where to invite
          you without taking risks.

                      LEE
          I promised myself I wouldn't let
          this happen till you were living
          alone. I was so torn when you called.

She parts a corner of the curtains, looking out the window,
turning when Elliot speaks.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen)
          I've wanted to call you everyday
          since I first told you how I felt.

He walks over to Lee by the curtained windows.

                      ELLIOT
          I resisted so many times.
              (pausing)
          Don't think badly of me.

He takes Lee into his arms.

                      ELLIOT
          This is not an easy situation.

                      LEE
              (whispering)
          I know it isn't.

                                                       113.

They kiss, their figures almost silhouetted in the warm glow
of the room. Elliot takes Lee's coat off without breaking
the kiss. They embrace. They kiss each other lightly, then
stronger, more passionately, their embrace much tighter.

And it's later that night. The harpsichord music begins to
play again as the camera moves over the bed covers to reveal
Lee, lying contentedly under the sheets, her hair fanned out
on the pillows, one arm near her head.

                      LEE
          That was just perfect.    You've ruined
          me for anyone else.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen)
          I don't want anyone else ever to
          have you.

                       LEE
              (sighing)
          I was so worried I wouldn't compare
          with Hannah.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen, laughing)
          Oh, my God.

He enters the screen, sitting down on the edge of the bed
next to Lee. He holds a cigarette.

                      ELLIOT
          You really do have those thoughts,
          don't you?

                      LEE
              (chuckling, touching
               Elliot's arm)
          Oh, all the time.

Elliot chuckles; they hold hands.

                      LEE
          I know she must be a really passionate
          person.

                      ELLIOT
              (looking at their
               clasped hands)
          Yes, she's, she's very warm, but,
          but it-it's me that wants to be giving
          to you. I-I-I want to do things for
          you. Hannah doesn't need me as much.
                      (MORE)

                                                       114.

                       ELLIOT (CONT'D)
              (chuckling as Lee
               laughs)
          I'm being presumptuous. Not that
          you need me.

                      LEE
              (nodding)
          I want you to take care of me...
          And I love when you do things to me.

Elliot leans down to Lee; they begin to kiss passionately.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE FREDERICK'S LOFT - NIGHT

Lee walks along the sidewalk in the rain; she's bareheaded.

The streets are dark. A car drives by; a pedestrian passes
holding an umbrella. Lee passes a restaurant well lit inside
by hanging lamps. The baroque music continues as she enters
the loft, her head soaked. She closes the door, touching
her soaking hair.

                       FREDERICK
              (offscreen)
          You're late.

Lee walks through the loft's living room area, unbelting her
coat, towards the bathroom. She passes Frederick, who sits
at a table in the kitchen area, drinking a cup of coffee and
reading the paper. A plate with a half-eaten sandwich sits
in front of him. The music stops.

                      LEE
              (opening the bathroom
               door)
          Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't
          realize how late it had gotten.

                      FREDERICK
              (barely glancing up
               from his paper)
          You missed a very dull TV show about
          Auschwitz. More gruesome film
          clips...and more puzzled intellectuals
          declaring their mystification over
          the systematic murder of millions.

As he talks, Lee is seen turning on the bathroom light. She
takes off her coat, hanging it on a hook, then begins to dry
her hair with a towel.

                                                       115.

                      FREDERICK
              (turning his head
               slightly in Lee's
               direction and
               gesturing)
          The reason why they could never answer
          the question ""How could it possibly
          happen?"" is that it's the wrong
          question. Given what people are,
          the question is
              (swallowing)
          ""Why doesn't it happen more often?""
          Of course it does, in subtler forms.

Frederick takes a bite of his sandwich and another sip of
coffee as Lee walks out of the bathroom, tossing the towel
down on the counter.

                      LEE
              (moving her fingers
               through her wet hair)
          I have a little headache from this
          weather.

She takes a kettle and fills it with water.

                      FREDERICK
              (grunting, sipping
               his coffee)
          It's been ages since I sat in front
          of the TV... just changing channels
          to find something.

As Frederick continues his monologue, Lee is busy in the
background: striking a wooden match and lighting a burner on
the stove for the kettle, taking a glass out of the cupboard,
walking into the bathroom for some pills, filling the glass
with water in the kitchen sink, and taking her pills.

                      FREDERICK
          You see the whole culture...Nazis,
          deodorant salesman, wrestlers...beauty
          contests, the talk show... Can you
          imagine the level of a mind that
          watches wrestling?
              (gesturing)
          Hmm? But the worst are the
          fundamentalist preachers...third-
          rate con men, telling the poor suckers
          that watch them that they speak for
          Jesus...and to please send in money.
              (picking up his
               sandwich)
          Money, money, money!
                      (MORE)

                                                       116.

                      FREDERICK (CONT'D)
          If Jesus came back, and saw what's
          going on in his name, he'd never
          stop throwing up.

He takes a bite of his sandwich and a sip of coffee. Lee
sets her glass on the kitchen counter and walks towards the
bedroom area.

                      LEE
              (impatiently, her
               hands in her hair)
          Oh, God, Frederick, could you please
          lighten up?! I'm really not in the
          mood to hear a review of contemporary
          society again.

She starts to take off her wet clothes by the bed. Frederick
takes off his glasses. He turns and looks at Lee in surprise.

                      FREDERICK
              (standing up from the
               table)
          You know, you've been very nervous
          lately.

                      LEE
              (sighing)
          I can't take this anymore.

                       FREDERICK
               (walking over to the
                bed)
          I'm just trying to complete an
          education I started on you five years
          ago.

                      LEE
              (unbuttoning her blouse)
          I'm not your pupil.
              (sighing, her hands
               at her side)
          I was, but I'm not.

                      FREDERICK
              (sitting down on the
               edge of the bed)
          When you leave the nest, I just want
          you to be ready to face the real
          world.

He pulls Lee down next to him on the bed.

                                                      117.

                         LEE
                 (putting her hand on
                  Frederick's leg)
             Frederick, we're going to have to
             make some changes.

She sighs.

                         FREDERICK
                 (quickly looking at
                  Lee, alarmed)
             Like what?

                         LEE
             Oh, you know what.    I'm suffocating!

                         FREDERICK
                 (turning away, his
                  hands clasped in
                  front of him)
             Oh! Are we going to have this
             conversation again?

                         LEE
             Yes, we're going to have this
             conversation again. I...I have to
             leave. I have to move out.

                            FREDERICK
                    (shaking his clasped
                     hands intensely)
             Why?

                         LEE
                 (sighing)
             Because I have to!

                         FREDERICK
                 (emotionally)
             What are you going to use for money?!

                         LEE
             I don't know. I thought, maybe I'd
             move in with my parents for a while.

                         FREDERICK
             Tch, oh. I always told you you would
             leave me.
                 (looking at Lee)
             But...does it have to be now?

                                                       118.

                      LEE
              (hugging her arm with
               her other hand)
          Well, maybe it'll only be temporary,
          but I ha--I have to try.

                       FREDERICK
              (taking Lee's head in
               his hands and looking
               at her)
          Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.
              (pausing)
          Good God! Have you been kissed
          tonight?!

                        LEE
                (reacting, pushing
                 Frederick's hands
                 from her face)
          No.

                      FREDERICK
              (reacting)
          Oh, yes, you have!

                        LEE
                (quickly standing up,
                 defensively)
          No.

                      FREDERICK
              (raising his voice)
          You've been with someone!

                      LEE
              (overlapping, running
               away from the bed)
          Stop accusing me!

Lee runs into the kitchen, her hands tight around her chest.

                      FREDERICK
              (offscreen)
          I'm too smart, Lee! You can't fool
          me! You're turning all red!

Lee, fraught with emotion, briefly puts her outstretched
hands on the refrigerator door, then turns around and leans
against it, hugging herself, her blouse still unbuttoned,
her hair still wet and bedraggled.

                      LEE
          Leave me alone!

                                                          119.

Frederick enters the kitchen area and leans against the
counter.

                      FREDERICK
              (angrily)
          Oh, Christ! What's wrong with you?!

                      LEE
              (leaning against the
               refrigerator, sighing)
          I'm sorry.

                      FREDERICK
          Oh, couldn't you say something?
          You have to slither around behind my
          back!

                       LEE
              (overlapping, her
               voice emotionally
               raised)
          I'm saying it now!

                      FREDERICK
          So you met somebody else?

                      LEE
              (sighing, nodding)
          Yeah.

Frederick cringes, reacting.   He puts his hand to his
forehead; he sighs.

                      LEE
              (walking into the
               bathroom)
          But you, God, you knew that was going
          to happen sooner or later. I can't
          live like this!

                      FREDERICK
              (turning to face Lee
               in the bathroom, his
               arms crossed)
          Who is it?

                      LEE
              (frantically putting
               things in her purse,
               glaring at Frederick)
          What's the difference?! It's just
          somebody I met!

                       FREDERICK
          But who?   Where did you meet him?

                                                         120.

                      LEE
          It doesn't make a difference!   I
          have to move out!

                      FREDERICK
          You are, you are my only connection
          to the world!

Lee turns and faces Frederick in the bathroom doorway.

                      LEE
              (gesturing emotionally)
          Oh, God, that's too much
          responsibility for me. It's not
          fair! I want a less complicated
          life, Frederick. I want a husband,
          maybe even a child before it's too
          late.

                      FREDERICK
              (reacting, his face
               in his hand)
          Jesus...Jesus!

                       LEE
              (gesturing, moving
                closer to Frederick)
          Oh, God, I don't even know what I
          want.

                       FREDERICK
              (sighing heavily,
                reacting)
          Oh...

                      LEE
              (rubbing Frederick's
               shoulder tenderly)
          Tch, oh, what do you get out of me,
          anyway? I mean...
              (laying her head
               against his shoulder,
               sighing deeply)
          it's not sexual anymore. It's
          certainly not intellectual. I mean,
          you're so superior to me in every
          way that--

Frederick furiously shakes Lee away. He pounds his fist
against a cupboard. Lee, gasping, moves away.

                      FREDERICK
          Please, don't patronize me!

                                                         121.

He puts his hand on his forehead, then turns to the offscreen
Lee.

                       FREDERICK
          God! I should have married you years
          ago when you wanted to! I should
          have agreed.

He walks over to Lee in another area of the kitchen.

                      LEE
              (sighing)
          Oh, God, don't you know it never
          would have worked?

Frederick turns away from Lee.   He begins to pace near the
counter.

                      FREDERICK
          I told you, one day you would leave
          me...
              (leaning on the counter)
          for a younger man. I--

He loudly pounds his fist on the counter in despair and
frustration, then covers his eyes with his hands in sorrow.

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Hannah, wearing a plaid shirt, sits up in bed, a book propped
up on her knees. A cupboard with some bric-a-brac is mounted
behind the night table, which holds a small, white, warm-
glowing lamp and some photographs. She turns the page as
Elliot, in pajamas and silk bathrobe, enters.

She continues to read her book as he sits down at the edge
of the bed and muses. His voice is heard over the screen.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          What passion today with Lee. She's
          a volcano. It was a totally
          fulfilling experience... Just as I
          dreamed it would be.
              (nodding slightly as
               he takes off his
               slippers)
          That's what it was. It was like
          living out a dream...a great dream.
              (taking off his
               bathrobe)
          Now I feel very good and cozy being
          here next to Hannah.

                                                    122.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          There's something very lovely and
          real about Hannah.
              (tossing his bathrobe
               aside and lying down
               on the bed next to
               Hannah, his hands
               crossed over his
               stomach)
          She gives me a very deep feeling of
          being part of something. She's a
          wonderful woman...and I betrayed
          her. She came into my empty life
          and changed it...and I paid her back
          by banging her sister in a hotel
          room. God, I'm despicable.
          What a cruel and shallow thing to
          do.

                      (sitting up)
          I have to call her now and tell her
          what we did was crazy.
              (anxiously)
          It can't ever happen again. I'm not
          that kind of man...and I value Hannah
          too much. I love my wife.
          Now I've betrayed her. Oh, God!

Elliot frantically stands up and leaves the room.

                      HANNAH
              (reading, not looking
               up)
          Where're you going?

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen)
          I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a
          phone number in my desk. I forgot
          to phone Mel Kaufman.

                      HANNAH
              (still reading)
          It's so late.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen)
          Yeah, I know. I-I can't believe I
          forgot.

Elliot walks quickly into the darkened hallway.

                                                       123.

                      ELLIOT
              (muttering)
          What if he answers?
              (turning into the
               doorway leading to
               the living room)
          I'll hang up.
              (walking into the
               darkened living room)
          I'll tell her we can't communicate
          until I terminate my marriage.
              (whispering)
          It's immoral.

Elliot switches on the light. He paces back and forth in
front of the piano and an accompanying music stand. The top
of the piano is filled with family photos; the lamp he turned
on illuminates some framed pictures on the wall and the piece
of sheet music open on the piano.

                      ELLIOT
              (gesturing and
               whispering)
          Then, time will pass. I won't call,
          and she'll get the idea. I gotta
          stop this before I get in too deep.
          I'd rather hurt Lee a little, than
          destroy Hannah.

Elliot stops pacing and checks his wristwatch.

                      ELLIOT
              (whispering, rubbing
               his hands)
          It's one-thirty. She...she can't
          have a conversation with me...with
          him around. I'm getting hysterical.
              (putting his hands on
               his hips)
          I'll call her first thing in the
          morning. I'll call her at six.
              (pointing)
          Frederick goes jogging at six, yeah,
          she'll be alone. And I'll, I'll
          call her and nip it in the bud.

The phone rings.   Elliot jumps.

                      ELLIOT
              (loudly, to the
               offscreen Hannah,
               gasping)
          I've got it! I've got it!   I've got
          it!
                      (MORE)

                                                       124.

                       ELLIOT (CONT'D)
               (picking up the phone,
                into the telephone)
          Hello?
               (loudly, for the
                offscreen Hannah's
                benefit)
          Mel!

The movie cuts to Lee, standing in the dark in Frederick's
loft. She talks softly into the telephone.

                      LEE
              (into the telephone)
          I would have hung up if you hadn't
          answered and I promise I won't ever
          do this again, but I just had to
          tell you, I feel very close to you
          tonight. Very, very close.
              (pausing)
          Good night.

Lee hangs up the phone and the movie cuts back to Elliot,
standing in his living room. Stunned, he slowly lowers the
phone receiver.

                                                     CUT TO:

""The only absolute knowledge attainable by man is that life
is meaningless."" - Tolstoy Jazz is heard as the movie cuts
to the outside of a university library, the camera focused
on a huge replica of Rodin's Thinker before moving to the
front entrance. Mickey can be seen emerging from its depths.
He wears his raincoat, his hands are in his pockets. He
ponders the scene as he walks past the statue and a small
front garden and down the sidewalk. Passersby, some holding
books, are seen.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          Millions of books written on every
          conceivable subject by all these
          great minds, and, and in the end,
          none of 'em knows anything more about
          the big questions of life than I do.
          Ss--I read Socrates. You know, n-n-

          little Greek boys. What the hell's
          he got to teach me? And, and
          Nietzsche with his, with his Theory
          of Eternal Recurrence. He said that
          the life we live, we're gonna live
          over and over again the exact same
          way for eternity. Great.

                      MICKEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          That means I, uh, I'll have to sit
          through the Ice Capades again. Tch.
          It's not worth it.

The movie next cuts to a sunny day in Central Park. A male
jogger, seen through some tree branches, runs by. The camera
moves past him, revealing a pondering Mickey walking by the
reservoir. He continues to talk over the screen.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          And, and Freud, another great
          pessimist. Jeez, I was in analysis
          for years. Nothing happened. My
          poor analyst got so frustrated.
          The guy finally put in a salad bar.

Several joggers pass Mickey; he continues to ruminate.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          Oh! Look at all these people
          jogging...trying to stave off the
          inevitable decay of the body. Boy
              (smacking his lips)
          it's so sad what people go through
          with their-their stationary bike and
          their exercise and their...
              (glancing at a fat
               woman jogger in a
               red sweatsuit who
               runs by)
          ...Oh! Look at this one! Poor thing.
          My God, she has to tote all that fat
          around. Maybe the poets are right.
          Maybe love is the only answer.

Mickey goes over to the chain-link fence encircling the
reservoir. He stops walking and looks out over the water.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          Shh--Of course, I was in love with
          Hannah. That didn't work out too
          well.
              (sighing)
          I even took her sister out.
          Remember that?

Mickey continues to look through the fence at the water and
the distant skyline. A jogger crosses in front of him.

It's very quiet; the soft jazz continues.

                                                       126.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          Remember years ago when Hannah and I
          got divorced and she fixed me up
          with her sister Holly?

The film cuts abruptly to Mickey's flashback of his date
with Holly, beginning with a rock club performance. The
soft jazz becomes loud, pulsating rock. Three punkers--a
girl with pink hair, a girl with a spiked mohawk, and a guy
with Stevie Wonder braids and sunglasses--watch and bop their
heads to the sounds of the offscreen rock band, The 39 Steps.

The camera moves to the stage, revealing a sleazy-looking
rock band in the midst of their number.

                      THE 39 STEPS
              (singing)
          ""I want to be like you I said I'm
          going to fit into your group...""

As the band loudly plays on, the camera moves across the
spellbound audience, sitting at crowded, smoky, small tables,
to reveal a stricken Mickey and a mesmerized Holly squeezed
together at one of them. A nearby member of the audience
swills beer from a bottle. Holly, beating time to the music
and enjoying herself, takes a puff of her cigarette.

She wears a wristful of silver bracelets. She glances at
Mickey impatiently. He's the only one in the place wearing
a suit.

                      THE 39 STEPS
              (singing)
          ""I don't wanna be different Said I'm
          gonna be just like you Because I'm
          gonna buy the records That they play
          on radio...

Holly turns back to the band, who are still in full swing.

The camera moves down the body of the lead singer, singing
into a microphone, from his longish, curly red hair, through
his cut-off red shirt and sweaty torso, to his guitar. He
wears several silver bracelets on his wrists and gold
bracelets on his upper arm. The microphone screeches
feedback.

                      THE 39 STEPS
              (singing)
          ""I'm gonna dance at clubs Gonna do
          just what I'm told Because I'm
          bleedin' now And I'm bleedin' now I
          wanna slip, slip, slip, slip, slip
          Into the crowd I wanna slip, slip,
          slip, slip, slip Into the crowd...""

                                                       127.

The camera moves back to Holly and the even more stricken-
looking Mickey. They are crowded in with people. In the
background, a waitress holds up a tray. A man drinks from a
glass mug; people chatter indistinctly over the loud band.

The club is noisy, smoky, and thick with people. Holly
glances at Mickey once again, this time unable to contain
her annoyance.

                      HOLLY
          Oh, why are you making those faces?

                      MICKEY
              (leaning over to Holly,
               gesturing)
          I can't hear you. I can't hear
          anything. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna
          lose hearing in my ear! I'm--

                      HOLLY
              (interrupting,
               gesturing to the
               offscreen band)
          Listen, you are witnessing genius!

                      MICKEY
              (pointing to his ears)
          I, I, my ears are experiencing a
          meltdown! I can't hear anything.

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping, gesturing
               dramatically)
          Look, can't you feel the energy?
          It's tangible energy! The room's
          alive with positive vibrations!

She opens a vial of cocaine.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing, trying to
               talk over the band)
          Holly, I'm frightened! I'm--After
          they sing... they're gonna take
          hostages! Now let's--

Holly holds a short metal straw of cocaine to her nose and
sniffs it.

                      MICKEY
              (panicking)
          Don't, no, please.   Will you-- No,
          don't...

                                                      128.

                     HOLLY
             (holding the straw
              towards Mickey)
         You want some?

                     THE 39 STEPS
             (singing in the
              background while
              Holly and Mickey
              talk)
         ""I want to dress like you Say, I'll
         buy all the clothes I want to fuck
         like you Yeah, I'm sure it shows
         Because I'm...""

                     MICKEY
             (shaking his head)
         I don't. No. No.

                     HOLLY
             (overlapping, sniffing)
         Come on, Mickey. Come on.

                     MICKEY
             (overlapping, gesturing)
         But, no, you've been doing that all
         night! You're gonna...you're gonna
         burn a hole in your... You're gonna
         develop a third nostril! Really,
             (putting his hand on
              Holly's shoulder)
         don't, please.

While Mickey pleads with her, Holly puts her cocaine vial
into her purse. She holds a finger against one nostril and
sniffs. She then picks up her lit cigarette and continues
to smoke.

                     MICKEY
         Can we, can we go?

                       HOLLY
               (looking at the
                offscreen hand,
                bopping her head to
                the music and smoking)
         No!

                     MICKEY
             (touching his ear in
              pain)
         My--uh...

                                                       129.

The camera leaves the crowded tables and moves back to the
band. The lead singers continues to sing with his band,
swaying his body to the music...

                      THE 39 STEPS
              (singing)
          ""...Gonna buy the records That they
          play on the radio...""

...as the film cuts abruptly to outside the rock club. The
music has stopped. Mickey and Holly, almost in dark
silhouette, are walking at a fast clip along the sidewalk,
arguing. They pass some lighted clothing store windows; a
few cars go by in the dark street.

                      HOLLY
              (enthusiastically)
          I love songs about extraterrestrial
          life, don't you?

                      MICKEY
          Not when they're sung by
          extraterrestrials.

                      HOLLY
              (impatiently, with
               annoyance)
          Oh, well, I cannot communicate with
          you! I, you know, I never realized
          you were such a tightass.

                      MICKEY
          I can't understand you. Your sisters,
          both sisters have such good taste in
          music. I don't know where you went,
          went wrong.

                      HOLLY
              (gesturing)
          Do you mind? I'm-I'm my own person.

                      MICKEY
          Can I take you someplace to hear
          something nice?

                      HOLLY
              (touching the hat on
               her head)
          Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.

                      MICKEY
          Now come on, you're be--, 'cause
          you're being angry at me.

                                                       130.

They stop briefly at a street corner and look for oncoming
cars before crossing. Mickey takes Holly's arm as they walk
across the street towards the camera.

                      HOLLY
              (angrily)
          I'm not angry! You know, you, well,
          you don't believe in ESP, you don't
          like rock music, you won't get high...
          It's like I'm dating Cardinal Cooke!

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. THE CARLYLE CLUB - NIGHT

Bobby Short is playing ""I'm In Love Again"" on the piano,
accompanied by a bass player. An Art Deco mural fills the
wall behind him...

                      BOBBY SHORT
              (singing)
          ""Why am I Just as reckless as a child?
          Why am I Like a racehorse running
          wild? Why am I In a state of ecstasy?
          The reason is 'cause something's
          Happened to me I'm in love again And
          the spring is comin'...""

...as the camera leaves the musicians and moves to the
conversatively dressed audience. A far cry from the rock
club atmosphere, the Carlyle is quiet except for Bobby Short's
singing. The audience at their tables watch him, some with
smiles of pleasure. A man has his arm around a woman. Jewels
sparkle in another woman's hair. The men wear suits.

Mickey and Holly sit at one of the tables; a candle burns in
its holder on the tabletop. Holly takes a cigarette from
her purse as she holds her hand to her nose, sniffing.

Mickey keeps shooting glances at Holly; she can't sit still.

Bobby Short continues to sing...

                      BOBBY SHORT
              (singing)
          ""I'm in love again
          Hear my heart strings strummin'
          I'm in love again
          And the hymn they're hummin'
          Is those cuddle-up huddle-up blues
          I'm in love again
          And I can't rise above it...""

                                                         131.

...as Holly lights her cigarette, dropping her matchbook on
the floor. She bends down to pick it up, then starts to
fidget in her chair. She gulps her wine; she sniffs.

Mickey tries to watch the offscreen Bobby Short; he crosses
his arms across his chest.

The film cuts back briefly to Bobby Short playing the piano...

                      BOBBY SHORT
              (singing, continuing)
          ""I'm in love again
          And I love, love, love it.""

                                        THEN ABRUPTLY CUTS TO:

EXT. THE CARLYLE HOTEL - NIGHT

A taxi pulls away from the curb as Mickey and Holly walk out
of the hotel through its revolving doors. Holly stays under
the awning; Mickey walks to the curb and looks angrily back
at her. People pass by as Mickey walks back and forth from
the curb to Holly, growing angrier and angrier.

                      HOLLY
          Thanks for a swell time.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          Well, if you didn't like it, you
          didn't like it, but you didn't have
          to talk while the guy was singing.

                      HOLLY
          I was so bored!

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          Yeah, that's tough! You don't deserve
          Cole Porter. You should stay with
          those groups that look like they're
          gonna stab their mother!

                      HOLLY
          At least I'm open to new concepts!

                      MICKEY
          And you don't have to snort cocaine
          at the table all the time! What do
          you, what do you do? Carry a kilo
          around in your purse?

                                                          132.

                      HOLLY
              (gesturing)
          This crowd wouldn't know the
          difference! They're embalmed!

                      MICKEY
          Jesus...
              (waving his arm and
               whistling for a taxi)
          I'm glad Hannah got us together.
          You know, she's got a great instinct
          for people. Really.

A taxi pulls up to the curb.     Mickey and Holly walk up to
its rear door.

                      HOLLY
          Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work
          out.

                      MICKEY
              (overlapping)
          Yeah. Me, too.

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping)
          You know, it's probably my fault.
          I've been a little depressed lately.

                      MICKEY
              (overlapping)
          Right. Yeah. I had a...

                         HOLLY
                 (overlapping)
          God!

                      MICKEY
              (continuing)
          ...I had a great time tonight, really.
          It was like the Nuremberg Trials.

He holds the door open for Holly.    She gets in.

                      HOLLY
              (angrily)
          Oh, I'll see myself home!

Holly slams the door. Mickey starts to walk along the
sidewalk as the taxi drives off; he passes the hotel and
several evening-lit store windows. ""I'm In Love Again"" begins
to play in the background as Mickey's voice is heard.

                                                       133.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          Yeah, it was quite an evening.
          Holly with her cocaine...
              (chuckling)
          She should have been wearing a gold
          shovel around her neck. Tch, she
          was polymorphously insensitive, I
          think.
              (smacking his lips)
          Too bad, too... 'cause, you know, I
          always had a little crush on her.

Both a bus and a taxi drive down the street, blocking Mickey
from view. The music stops and the film cuts to:

Afternoons.

A big-band rendition of ""You Made Me Love You"" begins as the
film cuts to a hotel room. Elliot and Lee can be seen dancing
cheek to cheek in the reflection of a mirror over a dresser.
A TV sits in the corner. A lamp is on one side of the
dresser; on the other side is a bucket with champagne.

Two half-full glasses sit nearby. Elliot and Lee dance into
view. Without missing a beat, Elliot picks up one of the
glasses of champagne and hands it to Lee. She sips. Elliot
sips, then puts it back down on the dresser. They embrace
tightly, continuing to dance.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. HANNAH'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Elliot, Hannah, and the twins sit at the dining room table.

A Christmas tree stands in the corner of the room, next to a
table holding a lamp; a picture hangs on the wall. The family
has just finished eating; the table is cluttered with the
remains of dinner, including a quart of milk, some chocolate
syrup, and a bottle of ketchup. Hannah's two adopted children
stand by her chair; she is showing them how a small camera
works. The children watch her, fascinated, muttering among
themselves. Elliot looks listless. He stares blankly at
the table.

                      HANNAH
              (to her adopted
               children, holding
               the camera)
          Oh, you just have to read the
          instructions. I mean, you just set
          one of these things and you can take,
          you can take pictures underwater.

                                                       134.

                      CHILD 1
              (overlapping)
          Can I try it?

                      HANNAH
              (handing him the camera)
          Sure! Yeah. When we get to the
          country, we'll try it in the lake.

The child takes the camera from Hannah, as well as picking
up a second identical one from the table.

                      CHILD 1
          Okay.

                       HANNAH
              (resting her chin in
                her hands)
          Okay?

                      CHILD 2
              (overlapping)
          Can I go?

                      CHILD 1
              (overlapping)
          Yeah.

                      HANNAH
              (nodding)
          Yeah! Okay.

The adopted children leave, the twins going off with them.

When they're gone, Hannah takes a sip of her coffee and looks
at Elliot. She puts down her cup, still watching him.

                      HANNAH
              (after a beat)
          Are you in a bad mood?

                      ELLIOT
              (shaking his head
               slightly)
          I don't know. Um...I'm just antsy.

The camera moves in on their faces as they continue to speak.

Family photos line the mantel behind Hannah's head.

                      HANNAH
              (intensely)
          Yes. I know. The last few weeks,
          you haven't been yourself.
                      (MORE)

                                                  135.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)
          And tonight at, tonight at dinner,
          you, you were kind of curt with me.

                      ELLIOT
              (looking down at his
               hands)
          Was I?

                      HANNAH
          Yes, you were. A-and when I, when I
          brought up the idea of having a baby,
          you just, you jumped down my throat.

                      ELLIOT
              (shaking his head)
          Well, I-I don't think it's a very
          good idea.

                      HANNAH
          Why not?

                       ELLIOT
              (edgily)
          Because it's the last thing in the
          world we need right now.

                      HANNAH
          Why do you say that?   Is there
          something wrong?

                      ELLIOT
          I don't know.

                      HANNAH
          Well, tell me. Should I be worried?

                      ELLIOT
          But, you got four children!

                      HANNAH
          I want one with you.

                      ELLIOT
          Well...I-I think we should wait till
          things settle.

                      HANNAH
          But what do, what do you--
              (stuttering)
          what's that mean? W-w-we've been,
          we've been married for four years.

How settled can things get?

                                                        136.

                      ELLIOT
              (gesturing)
          You know, y-you have some very set
          plans on how your life should be
          structured. A-a house, uh, kids,
          certain schools, a h--, a home in
          Connecticut. I-it's all
          very...preconceived.

                      HANNAH
              (shaking her head)
          Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed
          that. When-when-when we met, you
          said your life was chaos.

                      ELLIOT
          I-I-I know, but there's got to be
          some give and take.

Hannah sighs.   Elliot angrily throws his napkin on the table.

He stands up and begins to pace behind Hannah.

                      ELLIOT
          Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what
          the hell I'm talking about.

                      HANNAH
              (reacting)
          Are you angry with me?

                       ELLIOT
          No!

                      HANNAH
          Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted
          with our marriage?

                      ELLIOT
              (pointing at Hannah)
          I didn't say that.

                      HANNAH
          Are you in love with someone else?

                      ELLIOT
              (angrily)
          My God! Wha-what is this?   The
          Gestapo? No.

He sits down again, in a chair next to Hannah; the ketchup
bottle sits in front of him.

                                                         137.

                      HANNAH
              (turning to look at
               him)
          Well, what? What, wh-what are you
          not telling me?

                      ELLIOT
              (gesturing and pointing)
          What kind of interrogation... Us-
          supposing I said yes? I-I-I am
          disenchanted. I am in love with
          someone else.

                        HANNAH
          Are you?

                        ELLIOT
                (staring at Hannah
                 for a beat before
                 answering her)
          No!
              (gesturing)
          But you keep asking these, these
          awful questions. My God, it's-it's
          like you want me to say yes!

                      HANNAH
              (gesturing)
          What, you, of c-- What are you talking
          about? Of course not. I'd be
          destroyed!

The camera moves in on Elliot's anguished face.    He talks
over the screen.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          For Chrissakes, stop torturing her.

Tell her you want out and get it over with. You're in love
with her sister. You didn't do it on purpose. Be honest.
It's always the best way.

He looks down. Hannah leans over and tenderly puts her hand
on his shoulder.

                       HANNAH
              (softly)
          Look, can I help you? If you're
          suffering over something, will you
          share it with me?

She touches his hand; Elliot embraces her.

                                                        138.

                       ELLIOT
          Hannah, you know how much I love
          you.
               (kissing her on the
                forehead)
          I ought to have my head examined.
          I don't deserve you.

Elliot kisses Hannah again; they embrace tightly.   She touches
his hair.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. SOHO CLOTHING BOUTIQUE - DAY

The screen shows a metal staircase next to a large white
column. Holly's voice can be heard as she and Hannah make
their way up the stairs, moving into view. A man carrying a
shopping bag walks down the steps; he passes them. Hannah
and Holly talk as they climb.

                       HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          You know, I just want to look so
          good, but I don't want to seem, you
          know, like I'm overdressed.
              (onscreen, walking up
               the stairs behind
               Hannah)
          You know what I'm saying?

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping, turning
               to look at Holly)
          Oh, no, not at all.

                      HOLLY
              (holding up a dress
               she's carrying on
               her arm)
          Well, how about this?

                      HANNAH
              (looking at the dress)
          Well, I, I really like that. I think
          that's a pretty color on you.

                                                      139.

              (overlapping)
          Oh, yeah.
              (laughing)
          Hannah and Holly reach the top of
          the stairs. They walk onto a
          cavernous, high-tech floor. Empty
          bleachers line one wall; the rest of
          the floor is filled with racks of
          clothes and empty space.

                      HOLLY
              (continuing, smiling)
          Did you ever think you'd be helping
          me buy something to wear to the opera?
              (chuckling)

                      HANNAH
              (playfully hitting
               Holly's arm)
          Nuh-uh...but I think it's great.    I
          can't wait to meet him.

Holly follows Hannah to a rack of blouses.

                      HOLLY
          He's married...

                      HANNAH
              (interrupting, looking
               through the rack)
          Oh-oh.

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping)
          ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of
          institutions. She's schizophrenic.

Holly continues to talk as she follows Hannah across the
floor to a rack of dresses. Hannah's on one side, flipping
through the hangers. Holly, on the other side of the same
rack, talks to her sister, not looking at the clothes.

                      HOLLY
          Sometimes she's terrific...

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping)
          Oooo.

                      HOLLY
          ...and then she just breaks down.
                      (MORE)

                                                       140.

                      HOLLY (CONT'D)
              (gesturing)
          And he has this sweet daughter...and
          when she goes to college next year,
          he's going to split permanently. I
          mean...

                        HANNAH
                (overlapping, looking
                 up at Holly)
          Oh?

                      HOLLY
          ...he's really paid his dues,
          but...then she helped put him through
          architecture school, you know, so...

Hannah takes a jacket on a hanger off the rack and looks at
it. She holds it to her.

                      HANNAH
              (interrupting, glancing
               at her sister for a
               moment with amazement)
          You found all this, all this out on
          one date?

                      HOLLY
              (chuckling and nodding)
          Well, I think he was dying to open
          up. It's so sad.
              (finally looking back
               and forth along the
               rack)
          Now...what should I wear to my
          audition?

Hannah turns to Holly with surprise. She puts the jacket
back on the rack and stares at her; she inhales.

                      HOLLY
              (explaining)
          I've got a singing audition for a
          Broadway musical.
              (chuckling)
          Of course, I'll never get it.

                        HANNAH
          Singing?

                      HOLLY
              (chuckling)
          Yeah, can you believe it?

                                                         141.

                      HANNAH
              (walking around the
               rack to Holly, still
               surprised)
          Really?

                      HOLLY
              (vulnerably)
          Well, I mean, why not? You know, wh-
          what have I got to lose? Uh...

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping, shaking
               her head)
          Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh...
          No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't,
          I didn't know you sung.

Hannah begins to look at the rack of clothes on Holly's side,
while her sister stares at her, frowning.

                      HOLLY
              (defensively)
          Well, you think everybody in m-
          musicals sings so well?

                       HANNAH
              (gesturing, shaking
                her head)
          No! No, I, eh, it's just that they
          sing.

Holly is silent for a moment.    Hannah takes a blouse off the
rack and looks at it.

                      HOLLY
          Well...you know, uh...I sing a little,
          I mean...
              (chuckling self-
               consciously)

                         HANNAH
                 (realizing she's hurt
                  Holly, reacting)
          Ohh!

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping, shaking
               her head)
          You know.

                                                         142.

                       HANNAH
              (hanging the blouse
               back on the rack)
          I know, no--
              (chuckling)
          I know.

                      HOLLY
              (Overlapping, still
               chuckling self-
               consciously, gesturing)
          I mean, y-you know, don't say it
          that way, you know, because my
          confidence is not my strong point, I--

                      HANNAH
              (interrupting, touching
               her sister's shoulder)
          No, I'm sorry. No, I didn't mean
          that. No, I didn't mean that.

The two sisters walk away from the rack, Hannah slightly in
the lead. Behind them are some more racks of clothing and a
large window with closed venetian blinds.

                      HOLLY
              (gesturing)
          Uh, you know, I think I can fake my
          way through a song.

                      HANNAH
              (nodding as she looks
               around the store,
               pulling up her
               shoulder bag strap)
          Uh-huh.

                      HOLLY
          Easily.

Holly pauses, looking at her sister.    They continue to walk.

                      HOLLY
              (looking at Hannah)
          W-why? You don't think it's
          realistic?

                      HANNAH
              (putting her hand on
               Holly's shoulder)
          No, I didn't, I, that's no.    No, I-
          I-I, no, I-I just...
                      (MORE)

                                                       143.

                      HANNAH (CONT'D)
              (gesturing)
          Hate to see you put yourself in a
          position where, where you get hurt,
          you know. You know, you know how
          you take...

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping, nodding)
          Yeah.

They walk over to a table laid out with colorful scarves and
decorated with hurricane lamps bordering its edges.

                      HANNAH
              (continuing, looking
               at some clothes
               hanging beneath the
               table)
          every, eh, single rejection as-
          as-as a...a confirmation that you
          have no talent, or something?

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping, nodding)
          Yeah. Well, maybe I'll get it.
              (chuckling and
               gesturing)

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping, looking
               at the clothes)
          I hope.

Holly looks at her sister for a beat.

                      HOLLY
              (sighing)
          Boy, you really know how to cut me
          down.

                      HANNAH
              (looking at Holly,
               reacting)
          What? You don't, don't be so
          sensitive. Can't I say anything?

                      HOLLY
              (gesturing)
          Tch, well, I sing!
              (suddenly shouting)
          For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me
          sing!

                                                       144.

A female customer, who'd come over to the table, browsing
through the rack of clothes near Hannah, looks up, reacting.

She walks away.

                       HANNAH
              (overlapping, reacting
                to her sister's
                outburst)
          Okay!
              (looking at her sister)
          Okay. I-- What happened? You know,
          we were having a really nice time, a-
          and suddenly, everything went to bad
          feeling.

She walks past Holly and briefly looks at a different rack
of clothes beneath the table.

                      HOLLY
              (shaking her head)
          Nobody but you can do that to me.
          I don't know why.

                      HANNAH
              (gesturing)
          Look, everything's going your way.

She walks offscreen to a nearby rack; the camera remains
focused on Holly.

                       HOLLY
          You're right.
              (pausing)
          I'm happy.
              (shrugging, looking
               at the offscreen
               Hannah)
          Why must I let my insecurities spoil
          everything?

Holly chuckles and begins to look through the scarves on the
table.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. THEATER - DAY

A group of theater executives, including the producer, the
director, and two assistants, sit in a cluster in the empty
audience, talking; they look up at the offscreen Holly, who
is auditioning on the stage. She is singing ""I'm Old-
Fashioned,"" accompanied by a piano.

                                                         145.

                       HOLLY
              (offscreen, singing
               softly)
          ""This year's fancies Are passing
          fancies...""

The film moves from the audience to the stage where Holly,
her hands clasped in front of her, continues to sing her
song. A large group of other hopefuls are seen in the
background behind her.

                      HOLLY
              (continuing her
               singing, barely moving
               her body)
          ""But sighing sighs Holding hands
          This my heart Understands I'm old-
          fashioned And I don't mind it It's
          how I want to be As long as you agree
          To stay old-fashioned with me.""

The camera moves from Holly back to the executives in the
audience. As it passes the empty audience seats, they are
heard offscreen.

                      PRODUCER
              (offscreen)
          Thank you.

                      DIRECTOR
              (offscreen)
          Thank you.

                      PRODUCER
              (offscreen)
          It was very nice.

                      ASSISTANT #1
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          Terrific.

The camera has reached the executives in the audience.   They
are now chattering among themselves, Holly forgotten.

                      STAGE MANAGER
              (offscreen, overlapping
               the executives'
               chatter)
          April Knox?

The film cuts back to the stage, where April, handling the
audition pianist some sheet music, prepares herself to sing
""The Way You Look Tonight."" The stage is very black, stark,
except for April and the pianist.

                                                      146.

                      APRIL
              (singing)
          ""Someday When I'm awfully low When
          the world is cold I will get a glow
          Just thinking of you And the way you
          look Tonight...""

                                                    CUT TO:

EXT. A STREET OUTSIDE THE THEATER - DAY

A theater marquee can be seen on the busy street as Holly
and April walk down the street towards the camera, moving
closer and closer as they talk. Workmen and various street
noises can be heard indistinctly in the background.

                      HOLLY
          I'm telling you, you sounded great.
          You, uh, you may be surprised.

                      APRIL
              (sighing)
          Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering
          job this week. I'm real low on money.

                      HOLLY
          Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's
          eightieth birthday party on Riverside
          Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel,
          depending on his health.

                      APRIL
          Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.

                      HOLLY
              (reacting)
          What?

                      APRIL
              (gesturing)
          Uh, David called me last night, and
          he wants to take me to the opera.
              (chuckling)
          I didn't know what to say.

                      HOLLY
              (reacting)
          You're joking.

                      APRIL
          No, he called late last night.

                      HOLLY
              (sadly)
          I, uh, I'm very surprised.

                                                      147.

                      APRIL
              (chuckling, gesturing)
          He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.

                      HOLLY
              (looking briefly at
               April)
          And you, you-you're going?

                      APRIL
          Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say.
          First I said no, but then, he pressed
          it. He said, uh, he'd taken you
          once and he really wanted to invite
          me.

                      HOLLY
              (pausing)
          But I'm seeing him.

                      APRIL
              (gesturing)
          I know. I said that, but...
              (shrugging)
          he said it was something he really
          felt like doing.

                      HOLLY
              (stopping and facing
               April)
          Gee, um...
              (looking off, sniffing)
          I...I don't know what to say.

                      APRIL
          Look, it's just an evening at the
          opera. Did I, I-I do wrong in
          accepting?

Holly looks away sadly; she shakes her head.

                         APRIL
                 (continuing)
          Huh?

                                                    CUT TO:

The big leap.

The film cuts to Father Flynn's rectory office. The Catholic
priest looks out a simple stained-glass window, then turns
to an offscreen Mickey.

                                                        148.

                      FATHER FLYNN
              (gesturing)
          Now why do you think that you would
          like to convert to Catholicism?

The camera moves back to reveal Mickey, his back to the
camera, sitting in front of Father Flynn's desk. A lamp is
lit in the background; the Father's desk is neat. The room
is comfortably decorated in wood and leather.

                      MICKEY
          Well, uh, because, y-you know, I
          gotta have something to believe in,
          otherwise life is just meaningless.

                      FATHER FLYNN
              (pacing behind his
               desk and gesturing)
          I understand. But why did you make
          the decision to choose the Catholic
          faith?

The movie cuts to Mickey's face.   He's very neat in a tie,
sweater, and sports jacket.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          Tch. Well, y-you know...first of
          all, because it's a very beautiful
          religion. It's very well structured.
          Now I'm talking now, incidentally,
          about the-the, uh, against-school-
          prayer, pro-abortion, anti-nuclear
          wing.

                      FATHER FLYNN
              (offscreen)
          So at the moment you don't believe
          in God.

The camera cuts back to Father Flynn, who walks over to a
leather armchair next to a table set for tea. He begins to
pour the tea into china cups.

                       MICKEY
              (offscreen)
          No. A-a-and I-I want to. You know,
          I'm-I'm willing to do anything.
          I'll, you know, I'll dye Easter eggs
          if it works.

                                                         149.

                      MICKEY (CONT'D)
              (walking over to Father
               Flynn and sitting
               down in an adjacent
               chair)
          I-I need some evidence. I gotta
          have some proof. Uh, you know, i-
          i-if I can't believe in God
              (gesturing, his
               raincoat in his lap)
          then I don't think life is worth
          living.

                      FATHER FLYNN
              (stopping his tea
               pouring)
          It means making a very big leap.

Father Flynn clasps his hands in his lap.

                      MICKEY
              (nodding, fiddling
               with his raincoat)
          Yes, well, can-can you help me?

The film abruptly cuts to the long hallway in Mickey's
parents' apartment.

In the foreground, a section of the living room can be seen,
with a bureau holding a lamp and a framed photo. The hallway
itself is crowded with pictures and a wall shelf.

At the other end of the hallway, in the background, is another
bureau, with candlesticks on top and a framed picture on the
wall above. Mickey's mother stands in the front of this
bureau at the hallway's end, screaming at the top of her
lungs, holding her heart dramatically.

                       MOTHER
              (crying)
          Why? Oh, my God!

She sobs hysterically, staggering offscreen to the bathroom;
she shuts the door. Mickey walks into view, in the living
room, looking after his shocked mother, who continues to cry
over the scene.

                      MICKEY
              (overlapping and
               gesturing)
          I don't understand.
              (turning to his
               offscreen father)
          I thought that you would be happy.

                                                       150.

                      FATHER
              (offscreen)
          How can we be happy?

His father walks into view, carrying a teacup and a candy
dish. He strides past Mickey towards the kitchen.

                      MICKEY
              (following his father)
          Well, because I never thought of God
          in my life. Now I'm giving it serious
          thought.

                      FATHER
              (offscreen, in the
               kitchen)
          But Catholicism? Why not your own
          people?

                       MICKEY
              (gesturing at the
                kitchen door to his
                offscreen father)
          Because I got off to a wrong foot
          with my own thing, you know. B-b-
          b-but I need a dramatic change in my
          life.

                      FATHER
              (offscreen)
          You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?

                       MICKEY
               (gesturing)
          I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna
          try.

                      FATHER
              (offscreen)
          But why? We raised you as a Jew.

                      MICKEY
              (shrugging)
          So, just 'cause I was born that way...
          You know, I'm old enough to make a
          mature decision.

Mickey's father walks into view; he stands by the stove near
the kitchen doorway, picking up a dirty glass and some bowls
to clean.

                      FATHER
          But why Jesus Christ? Why, for
          instance, shouldn't you become a
          Buddhist?

                                                       151.

Holding the dirty dishes in his hand, Mickey's father looks
at his son.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          A Bud--? That's totally alien to
          me. Look, you're getting on in years,
          right? Aren't you afraid of dying?

Mickey's father walks offscreen again, to the kitchen sink.

                      FATHER
              (offscreen)
          Why should I be afraid?

                      MICKEY
              (loudly gesturing)
          Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!

                        FATHER
                (offscreen)
          So?

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          That thought doesn't terrify you?

Mickey's father walks out of the kitchen, past his son, to
the living room.

                      FATHER
              (waving his arm)
          Who thinks about such nonsense?
          Now I'm alive. When I'm dead, I'll
          be dead.

                      MICKEY
              (following his father,
               gesturing)
          I don't understand. Aren't you
          frightened?

                      FATHER
              (offscreen)
          Of what? I'll be unconscious.

                      MICKEY
              (turning and walking
               down the hallway)
          Yeah, I know. But never to exist
          again!

                      FATHER
              (offscreen)
          How do you know?

                                                        152.

                      MICKEY
          Well, it certainly doesn't look
          promising.

Mickey stops at the bathroom door at the other end of the
hallway. He starts to pound it.

                      FATHER
              (offscreen)
          Who knows what'll be?

Mickey's father comes back on screen; he's carrying a plate
of hors d'oeuvres and an empty glass towards the kitchen.

He stops and looks down the hall at Mickey, who's now
struggling to open the bathroom door.

                      FATHER
              (gesturing with his
               hands full)
          I'll either be unconscious or I won't.
          If not, I'll deal with it then. I'm
          not gonna worry now about what's
          gonna be when I'm unconscious.

                      MICKEY
              (pounding on the door)
          Mom, come out!

                      MOTHER
              (offscreen in the
               bathroom)
          Of course there's a God, you idiot!
          You don't believe in God?

                      MICKEY
              (sighing)
          But if there's a God, then wh-why is
          there so much evil in the world?
              (shrugging)
          What-- Just on a simplistic level.
          Why-why were there Nazis?

                      MOTHER
              (offscreen in the
               bathroom)
          Tell him, Max.

Mickey, reacting, hits his forehead.

                      FATHER
              (offscreen)
          How the hell do I know why there
          were Nazis? I don't know how the
          can opener works.

                                                       153.

Mickey starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to:

A beautiful snow-covered church downtown, complete with
courtyard and wrought-iron fence. A pedestrian walks by
with an umbrella. A church choir sings a soaring hymn over
the scene.

The music continues as the film moves inside, where the choir
is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold. A fairly
large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film cuts to
the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands underneath
some stained-glass windows, watching and listening to the
inspiring music.

The choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father Flynn
in his office.

He picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his
window and he walks over to Mickey, who's standing near his
desk, already holding several tomes. Father Flynn puts the
books on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through the
top one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door.

Next is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the
cross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression.

His eyes, especially designed to blink as the lights hit
them, open and close repeatedly. The hymn plays on, loudly,
as the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outside
a barber shop window, looking at the Christ playing and
shuffling from side to side to gets its eyes' 3-D effect.

Smaller inspirational pictures border the bigger, blinking
Christ. A barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby;
passing traffic is reflected in the window.

Mickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk
down the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open-
air-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving
pedestrians.

With the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly.

Mickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating
him. He's just entered his apartment. He closes the door
and walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag.

                                                         154.

He switches on the light, and walking past his spiral
staircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he makes
his way to his living room coffee table. Mickey pulls a
crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on the
table near a pile of books and some objets d'art. He then
takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on top of
the crucifix. Then out comes a framed picture of a saint.
It too gets put on the growing pile. But the bag is not yet
empty. Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and a large
jar of Hellman's mayonnaise. Mickey sets them on top of the
saint.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

Lee is walking down the street, looking around her. The
sidewalk is fairly crowded with people; the sounds of traffic
are heard. She passes some office buildings, a store's large
display window; she stops when she sees Hannah.

Her sister is waiting outside the Art Deco faade of a
restaurant; she's looking in the opposite direction. Lee
taps Hannah on the shoulder; Hannah, surprised, turns and
gasps.

                        LEE
                (overlapping Hannah's
                 gasp)
          Hi.

The sisters laugh and embrace each other.

                       HANNAH
          Hi.   Where's Holly?

                      LEE
              (overlapping)
          Hi. She's auditioning for a
          television commercial. She said
          she's gonna be a little late.

                      HANNAH
              (sighing)
          Oh, yeah? How's she doing?

She turns and walks towards the restaurant entrance.

                      LEE
              (following Hannah
               through the
               restaurant's doors)
          Oh, God, you know Holly.      When she's
          depressed, she's manic.
                      (MORE)

                                                       155.

                      LEE (CONT'D)
          I think it was a good idea that we
          invited her to lunch.

They disappear inside. The camera follows them, cutting to
the restaurant's interior at the same time the sisters walk
in. It's a chic, trendy place, with an Art Deco design and
high ceilings. A waiter in uniform stands near its glass
and metal doors, holding a tray to his chest; a few people
sit at the bar; a large plant in a vase sits in the
foreground. The sisters walk toward the coatcheck area,
deep in conversation.

                      HANNAH
              (pulling off her scarf,
               still on the subject
               of Holly)
          I hope you tell her it was your
          idea...

                      LEE
          Why?

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping)
          ...'cause every time I try to be
          helpful, you know, sh-she gets so
          defensive.

                       LEE
               (unbuttoning her coat)
          Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just
          embarrassed in front of you, that's
          all.

Hannah walks offscreen, farther into the coatcheck room.

She talks offscreen as Lee alone is seen, reacting and
speaking as well. In the background, a waiter crosses over
to the bar, then walks away.

                      HANNAH
              (offscreen)
          So how are you?

                      LEE
          Oh, me, I'm okay.

                      HANNAH
              (offscreen)
          Do you miss Frederick?

                      LEE
          No.

                                                      156.

                     HANNAH
             (offscreen)
         I can't believe Elliot and I can't
         think of someone nice for you to go
         out with, you know--

                      LEE
             (interrupting, her
              voice slightly higher-
              pitched as she takes
              off her coat)
         How are you?

                     HANNAH
             (offscreen)
         I'm okay.

                     LEE
             (overlapping)
         You know, how's everything? You
         doing okay? How's Frederick?
             (laughing)
         I mean, Elliot.

                     HANNAH
             (offscreen, overlapping)
         Y-yeah.

Hannah walks out of the coatcheck room without her coat;
it's Lee's turn to disappear and check her things. Now only
Hannah can be seen onscreen as the sisters talk. In the
background, the waiter once again walks over to the bar.

                     HANNAH
             (continuing)
         Oh, he's fine. He's-he's, I guess
         he's fine. I don't know.
             (shaking her head,
              her arms crossed)
         He's been kinda moody lately, the
         last few months.

                     LEE
             (offscreen, overlapping)
         Really?

                     HANNAH
         Yeah. I-I don't know what's wrong
         with him. He's just...kind of distant
         and difficult.

                     LEE
             (offscreen)
         Oh...

                                                         157.

                      HANNAH
              (overlapping, gesturing)
          I've been trying to talk to him about
          it. He says everything's fine, but
          I don't know. Automatically, you
          know, I leap to the worst conclusions.

                      LEE
              (offscreen)
          Like what?

As Hannah answers her sister, Holly can be seen entering the
restaurant and walking over to the coatcheck area, an unlit
cigarette in her mouth, her sunglasses still on her eyes.

                      HANNAH
              (gesturing)
          I mean, I don't know, he's seeing
          someone else or something, but...

                      LEE
              (walking back onscreen
               without her coat,
               reacting)
          Oh, no! I mean, everyone thinks
          things like that.

Hannah mumbles indistinctly as Holly walks over to her
sisters.

                      HANNAH
              (turning, to Holly)
          Hey, hi!

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping)
          Well, I just came from an audition...

                        LEE
                (overlapping, leaning
                 against the coatcheck

          Hi.

                      HOLLY
              (continuing)
          ...which I did not get.

                      HANNAH
              (reacting)
          Awwww...

                                                       158.

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping, sighing)
          So what's new?
              (She takes off her
               gloves and scarf,
               stuffing them in her
               bag)

                       HANNAH
              (helping Holly with
                her coat)
          Boy--

                      HOLLY
              (interrupting)
          They said I was too offbeat looking,
          whatever the hell that means.

                      HANNAH
          Oh, what do they know?

Holly gives her coat to the coatcheck person.

                      HOLLY
              (to the checker)
          Thanks.
              (turning to her sisters)
          But guess who was there auditioning?

                        LEE
          April?

The hostess appears, peeking around the corner of the
coatcheck area. She signals for the three sisters to follow
her.

                      HANNAH
              (reacting to Holly's
               news)
          Oh, gosh.

                        HOLLY
          You got it.

Holly takes off her sunglasses; her cigarette still dangles
from her mouth. Hannah murmurs her sympathy as the trio
follows the hostess into the dining room.

                      HOLLY
              (gesturing)
          I was very polite. I maintained my
          poise.
              (taking out a match
               for her cigarette)
          I said hello.

                                                       159.

The sisters walk to their seats, at a round table in the
middle of the room; the hostess puts down their menus.

                     LEE
          Hmm. I never trusted April, you
          know. She has eyes in the back of
          her head.

They sit down. The hostess leaves. Other diners are seen
in the background; a waiter is taking the order of a couple
sitting on a banquette; other waiters clear off a table.

Diners walk in and out. A low murmur of conversation, as
well as the faint clatter of dishes, is heard. The camera
moves closer to the three sisters, circling the table as
Holly speaks.

                      HOLLY
          Yeah, well, she and an architect are
          now a very definite item, which I
          still cannot believe.

                         LEE
                 (overlapping)
          Hmm.

                         HANNAH
          Oh, God...

                      HOLLY
              (nodding her head,
               holding her cigarette)
          Yeah, although it's put an end to
          the Stanislavski Catering Company.
          Which is why I have to speak to you.
          And...
              (gesturing to Hannah)
          you're gonna get impatient, but...I
          have to borrow some more money.
              (putting her cigarette
               in her mouth and
               picking up the matches)

                      HANNAH
              (shaking her head)
          Well, that...th-that's fine.

                      HOLLY
              (gesturing, her
               cigarette in one
               hand, her matches in
               the other)
          But what I decided to do is some
          writing.
                      (MORE)

                                                         160.

                      HOLLY (CONT'D)
          Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.
          You know, these meaningless auditions
          at cattle calls. And I can't handle
          another rejection.
              (emotionally)
          Now let's face it here. I gotta,
          you know, latch on to something in
          my life. You know--something with a
          future. I'm not sixteen anymore.
              (lighting her cigarette)
          It's just...crazy!
              (puffing her cigarette)
          I've got...an idea for a story.
          More than one. And I just need a
          few months, you know, or, uh, a year
          even.

As the camera slowly circles the table, Hannah is seen
listening to Holly, her hand on her mouth.

                      HOLLY
          I've picked up a lot about dramatic
          structure from doing my scenes in
          acting class.

Lee, her hand on her mouth, glances briefly at Hannah. As
Hannah replies to Holly, the camera focuses on Lee's face.

She bites her nails; she looks down, involved in her own
thoughts.

                      HANNAH
              (offscreen)
          Well, that-that's good. It just,
          uh...it just seems to me that-that
          six months or a year, if-if you spent
          it more productively...

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen, the camera
               still focused on Lee)
          Well-well, like what?

Lee looks up, her hand still on her mouth, watching Hannah,
as the camera slowly moves off her to show Hannah.

                      HANNAH
          Well, I don't know. We'd uh, uh,
          um... Didn't Mom mention there was
          something...something at the Museum
          of Broadcasting?

                                                      161.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          Yeah, that's clerical.

                      HANNAH
          No. She, didn't she say it was,
          um...she said it was in the publicity
          department. That-that can lead to
          other things.

The camera is back on Lee. She looks around tensely, barely
listening to the conversation. She fidgets. An empty table
sits in the background.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.

                      HANNAH
              (offscreen)
          I'm not! I'm not! I'm trying to be
          helpful. A person doesn't just say
          one day, ""Okay, now-now I'm finished
          as an actress. Now I'm a writer.""
          I mean--

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen,
               interrupting)
          Yeah, you mean not at my age.

                      LEE
              (shaking her head,
               unable to take much
               more)
          Oh, please! We all came to have
          lunch, didn't we?

                      HOLLY
              (reacting, now in
               view)
          Yeah, okay, right. Forget it.
              (puffing on her
               cigarette)
          What's to eat?

Holly abruptly picks up her menu.

                      LEE
              (trying to alleviate
               the tension)
          Boy...Holly...Holly.

                                                      162.

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping)
         I just want a salad.
              (to Hannah)
         You really think I'm a loser, don't
         you?

                     HANNAH
             (offscreen)
         What do--? You're being ridiculous.

                     LEE
             (overlapping, reacting)
         You are, Holly. Stop it.

                     HOLLY
             (to Hannah)
         You treat me like a loser.

                        HANNAH
                (offscreen)
         How?

                     HOLLY
         You never have any faith in my plans.
         You always undercut my enthusiasm.

She puffs intensely on her cigarette as the camera slowly
circles to Hannah's face. She is equally intense, looking
at both sisters as she speaks.

                     HANNAH
         Not so! No. I think I've been very
         supportive. I've...I try to give
         you honest, constructive advice.

                        HOLLY
                (offscreen)
         Hmm!

                     HANNAH
             (overlapping)
         I'm-I'm always happy to help you
         financially. I think I've gone out
         of my way to-to introduce you to
         interesting single men. There's
         nothing I would--

                     HOLLY
             (offscreen,
              interrupting)
         Uh, losers! All losers!

                     HANNAH
         You're too demanding.

                                                       163.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          You know, I could always tell what
          you thought of me by the type of men
          you fixed me up with!

The camera, slowly circling the table, is back on Lee's face.

While her sisters argue emotionally on her right and left,
she is looking down, biting her lip. She is outwardly still,
but her face is registering her seething emotions.

                      HANNAH
              (offscreen)
          You're crazy! That's not true.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.

                      LEE
              (interrupting angrily,
               looking as if she's
               about to cry)
          Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!

                      HANNAH
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          Oh, now--
              (stuttering)

                      LEE
              (interrupting, shaking
               her head)
          She's going through a really rough
          time right now.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          Why are you so upset?

                      LEE
              (sobbing and gesturing)
          You know, you've been picking on her
          ever since she came in here. Now
          just leave her alone for a while!
          I'm just suffocating.
              (sniffing back her
               tears)

                                                       164.

                      HOLLY
              (leaning over to Lee,
               puzzled, reacting to
               her sister's tears)
          What's the matter with you, Lee?
          Why are you so sensitive all of a
          sudden?

                       HANNAH
              (offscreen)
          Look.
              (onscreen, as the
                camera circles around
                the table)
          Listen. Listen.
              (tapping Holly on her
                shoulder and gesturing)
          You want to write? Write.

                       HOLLY
              (offscreen, overlapping
               to Lee)
          What's the matter?

                      HANNAH
              (flinging her hands)
          Write! Let's just not talk about it
          anymore.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          Good.

                       HANNAH
              (shaking her head)
          Take...take a year. Take six months.
          Whatever you want. Who knows? Maybe
          you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with
          a good play.

She opens her menu, then turns to Lee, reacting suddenly to
her sister, who is rubbing her forehead, looking terribly
upset.

                       HANNAH
              (to Lee)
          What's the matter? What's the matter
          with you?
              (offscreen again as
               the camera circles
               back to Lee)
          You look pale. You okay?

                                                       165.

                      LEE
              (overlapping, nodding
               and stuttering)
          I'm-I'm okay. Yeah, I-I-I, you know,
          I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of
          a sudden. I'm-I'm...I have a
          headache.

                      HANNAH
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          Yeah?

                      LEE
              (still rubbing her
               forehead, looking
               down at the menu)
          I think we need to eat.

                                                     CUT TO:

Summer in New York.

A piano plays ""Bewitched"" in the background as the film cuts
to a large tree, covered with bright white blossoms. The
camera moves down the tree to reveal a well-kept, red-brick
brownstone on a pleasant, sunny New York City street. A man
wearing a summer suit walks by as the film moves inside the
building, to Elliot's analyst's office. The psychotherapist
sits in a comfortable armchair next to a curtained window.

In front of the window sits a table covered with artifacts
and a large lamp. The analyst's fingers are touching, his
arms resting on the chair, as he listens to the offscreen
Elliot.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen)
          I-I can't seem to take action.
          I'm-I'm like, uh, Hamlet unable to
          kill his uncle.

The music stops as the camera moves across the room to reveal
Elliot, sitting in a wooden chair. He holds a long, thin
cigarette; he wears a gold Rolex watch. He face is not yet
seen.

                      ELLIOT
              (face offscreen)
          I want Lee, but I can't harm Hannah.

And in no other area am I a procrastinator.

Elliot raises his cigarette to take a drag. The camera
follows the cigarette up to his face. Elliot looks thoughtful
as the movie cuts to:

                                                          166.

EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

Lee, wearing jeans and carrying an armful of books, is running
up a broad set of steps in the sunlight, greeting other
students as she passes. Elliot continues to talk over the
scene...

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          Meanwhile...Lee has no direction.
          She's taking courses at Columbia...but
          just randomly.

...as Lee stops on a portico and turns to greet Doug, a
professor, who is running over to her, calling her name.

They mouth hello, smiling, and begin to walk off together.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          I try not to call her, but then she
          calls me and then...I call and...we
          try to resist meeting, but...once in
          a while we meet. Sometimes we argue
          because I can't break up my marriage.
          Sometimes we wind up making love
          and...we both feel terrible.

The film cuts back to Elliot in his analyst's office.

                      ELLIOT
          But it's my fault.

Elliot takes a last drag on his cigarette. The camera follows
his hand as he crushes it out in a nearby ashtray.

                      ELLIOT
              (face offscreen)
          For all my education, accomplishments,
          and so-called wisdom...I can't fathom
          my own heart.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Hare Krishna music is heard over a sunlit view of the
Manhattan skyline and the green trees of Central Park. The
camera moves down to reveal a large group of Hare Krishnas
dancing on the broad green lawn among other New Yorkers
enjoying the day. The leader, holding some pamphlets, stands
by a chain-link fence, a few feet away from his group, talking
to someone on the other side. It's Mickey, as the camera
soon shows, wearing a short-sleeved shirt, a paper tucked
under his arm.

                                        167.

            KRISHNA LEADER
What makes you interested in becoming
a Hare Krishna?

            MICKEY
    (gesturing, walking
     onscreen)
Well, I'm not saying that I want to
join or anything, but...but I know
you guys believe in reincarnation,
you know, so it interests me.

            KRISHNA LEADER
Yeah, well, what's your religion?

            MICKEY
    (gesturing)
Well, I was born Jewish, you know,
but, uh, but last winter I tried to
become a Catholic and...it didn't
work for me. I-I studied and I tried
and I gave it everything, but, you
know, Catholicism for me was die
now, pay later, you know.
And I just couldn't get with it.
And I, and I wanted to, you know.
I--

            KRISHNA LEADER
    (interrupting)
You're afraid of dying?

            MICKEY
    (gesturing)
Well...yeah, naturally. Aren't you?
I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation,
does that mean my soul would pass to
another human being, or would I come
back as a moose or an aardvark or
something?

            KRISHNA LEADER
    (handing some Krishna
     literature over the
     fence to Mickey)
Take our literature...

            MICKEY
    (nodding, taking the
     material)
Uh-huh.

            KRISHNA LEADER
...read it over, and think about it.

                                                       168.

                      MICKEY
              (looking down at the
               material he's just
               received)
          Well, okay. Thank you very much.

                      KRISHNA LEADER
          You're welcome. Hare Krishna.

Mickey walks off, the Hare Krishnas still dancing and singing
on the other side of the fence. He flips through the
literature as he walks, then looks straight ahead, pondering.
His voice is heard over the screen.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          Who are you kidding? You're gonna
          be a Krishna? You're gonna shave
          your head and put on robes and dance
          around at airports? You'll look
          like Jerry Lewis. Oh, God, I'm so
          depressed.

Mickey puts his hand to his mouth as another title appears
on a black screen.

Autumn chill.

Bach's Concerto for Harpsichord is heard as the film cuts to
the waterfront at dusk. A bench faces some wharf pilings;
the water gently laps against them as Lee walks into view,
the wind blowing her hair. She stands and faces the water
and the distant skyline across the bay. The view is
contemplative, beautiful in the dim light.

Lee is alone; her hands are in her pockets. Lee, thinking,
is heard over the scene; the harpsichord music plays in the
background.

                      LEE (V.O.)
          The nights are really getting cooler.
          Summer went so quickly.
          Soon it'll be fall.
              (walking to the beach
               and sitting down)
          My literature professor really likes
          me. It was fun being out with him
          last night.
              (staring pensively at
               the water)
          Funny. I feel like I'm betraying
          Elliot...but that's ridiculous.
          Why shouldn't I see Doug? Elliot's
          not free.
                      (MORE)

                                                       169.

                      LEE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              (pausing)
          Just go one step at a time. Let's
          see what the next few months bring.

The concerto stops and the movie cuts to Holly, leaning into
an open phone booth near a subway entrance. She wears a
football jacket, jeans, and sneakers; she holds a manuscript
in her arms. It's a busy corner. People rush past Holly
towards the subway; others are walking up the station steps.

Holly smokes a cigarette as she talks on the phone to Hannah.

                       HOLLY
              (into the telephone)
          Hannah? Hi. Listen, um, you'll be
          happy to know that your money has
          not gone completely to waste... No,
          I have an actual first rough draft
          of something I wrote... Yeah. Yeah.
          Yeah, well, I showed it to Lee, and
          she gave me some good pointers.
          And, um, listen, I'm pretty near
          where you live. I wonder if I could
          just drop it off...and, you know,
          when you have time, some time, read
          it, an-and we'll talk when I come
          over at Thanksgiving.
          Okay? All right. Okay. Oh, wait,
          wait.
              (turning her body,
                still on the phone)
          Listen. Listen. I think Lee met an
          interesting guy at Columbia...
          Yeah. Yeah, well, he sounds really
          nice...
              (puffing on her
                cigarette)
          Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, we'll
          talk at Thanksgiving. Bye-bye.

Holly hangs up the phone and takes a drag on her cigarette.

She looks off in the distance, smiling, as the film cuts to:

INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING - NIGHT

It's Thanksgiving at Hannah's once again. Guests are crowded
together in the living room, surrounding the piano, where
Evan is sitting and flipping through some sheet music.

Norma stands behind him, leaning against a book-laden wall.

                                                        170.

The guests are chattering, enjoying themselves; a lamp glows
on the corner of the piano. A little boy sitting in a chair
next to Evan is talking animatedly with a girl who is leaning
over the arm of the sofa. An adult guest talks to the little
boy; another guest takes a sip of wine from a glass she'd
placed on the bookshelf behind her as Evan turns and addresses
the group.

                      EVAN
              (gesturing)
          Now, here...here's a song that Norma
          sang on that trip we made up to the
          show in Buffalo. And, oh, was she
          beautiful that night!

The guests laugh appreciatively.   A woman comes over to Evan
and hands him some wine.

                      NORMA
          Come on.
              (laughing and touching
               Evan's shoulder)

                      EVAN
              (overlapping, to the
               woman)
          Thank you, honey.
              (putting his drink
               down on the piano)
          Oh, yes, you were, dear. Don't you
          remember that night?
              (gesturing and pushing
               back some sheet music
               that was starting to
               fall)
          She was so beautiful...she was so
          beautiful that when men saw her
          walking along the streets, they'd
          drive their cars right up on the
          sidewalk.

He laughs; the guests laugh with him.

                      EVAN
              (looking back at Norma)
          Isn't that right, honey, eh?

                      NORMA
              (tapping his shoulder)
          A slight exaggeration.

The guest continue to laugh; they are charmed.

                                                       171.

                      EVAN
              (overlapping Norma,
               laughing)
          I know.

                      NORMA
              (gesturing)
          But only slight.

Evan continues to laugh with everyone as he starts to play
the piano. A nearby woman toasts him with her drink. The
camera moves around the room as he plays, showing the various
guests, chattering over the music. Some are in clusters, in
private conversations; others listen and watch the offscreen
Evan. A couple stands by the window; one man gets up from
his chair and walks away. Some guests sip their drinks,
smiling, as the camera moves back to the piano and the book-
laden wall. Evan is playing the piano with exuberance.
Norma, still standing behind him, has a poignant, wistful
expression on her face. She mouths the words to the song
Evan is playing, ""It Could Happen to You.""

The woman next to her smiles, enjoying the music, as the
camera continues its exploration, moving to a man standing
in the doorway with a group of children. Mavis the maid
walks by with a tray of hors d'oeuvres. The man takes one,
mouthing his thanks, as the camera travels past the open
bookshelf, past two boys in suits who are drinking soda and
munching, to reveal Lee. She is leaning against another
doorway, a faraway look on her face as she listens to the
music. Mavis passes in the hall beyond the doorway. Several
people, deep in conversation, stand nearby as Elliot, holding
a drink, walks up behind her.

                      ELLIOT
              (sipping his drink)
          You've been very cold to me tonight.

                        LEE
                (glancing back at
                 Elliot, then turning
                 away)
          No.

                      ELLIOT
          Is something wrong?

                      LEE
              (turning)
          Oh, not here.
              (touching Elliot's
               arm)
          There are too many people around.

                                                          172.

Lee slips past Elliot and walks away. Elliot looks back at
her briefly, then, sipping his drink, he turns and looks
offscreen at the crowd in the living room.

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. HANNAH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Holly is standing in the pantry, preparing some offscreen
food. Near her is a restaurantlike swinging door with a
glass porthole. In the foreground, the kitchen table is
crowded with bowls and plates of food. An open cupboard
separates Holly from the rest of the room.

                      HOLLY
              (looking offscreen)
          Hey, Hannah? You know, I think Lee
          is really serious about her new
          boyfriend. Yeah, eh, from what I
          understand he sounds really nice.

Hannah walks into view, headed for the refrigerator.   She
carries two tomatoes.

                      HOLLY
          I'm so happy for her.   I think she's
          in love.

Hannah opens the refrigerator, totally ignoring Holly.

                      HOLLY
              (reacting)
          Hey, what's the matter?

                      HANNAH
              (taking a bunch of
               celery out and
               slamming the
               refrigerator door)
          I'm real upset about what you wrote.

Hannah walks over to the table, gathering up more food.

                       HOLLY
          My script?

                      HANNAH
          It's obviously based on Elliot and
          me.

                      HOLLY
          Oh, so loosely.

                                                       173.

                      HANNAH
              (angrily)
          No, not ""Oh, so loosely""! Real
          specifically! Is that how you see
          us?

                      HOLLY
              (shrugging, walking
               out of the pantry
               area)
          Well--

                      HANNAH
              (interrupting)
          Can I, can I not accept gestures and
          feelings from people? Do I, do I
          put people off?

Holly walks over to the sink and washes her hands.

                      HOLLY
              (reacting)
          Well, it's a made-up story.

She dries her hands as Hannah, her arms laden with vegetables,
strides over to her sister.

                      HANNAH
              (yelling)
          No, it's real exact! The-the
          situations, the dialogue, everything.
          It's-it's full of intimate details
          between Elliot and me! Which I don't,
          I don't see how you could even
          possibly know about. A conversation
          we once had about adoption?

Hannah storms out a nearby door as Holly turns away from the
sink.

                      HOLLY
              (gesturing, the towel
               still in her hand,
               as she speaks to her
               offscreen sister)
          Well, Lee mentioned that to me, so
          obviously you discussed it with her.
          You...
              (pacing around the
               table)
          I just took the essence and I blew
          it up into drama.

Holly wipes her hand on the towel as Hannah reenters the
kitchen, carrying even more vegetables.

                                                       174.

                      HANNAH
          I don't see how Lee could know about
          these things. I don't! I don't
          tell her everything.

Hannah strides into the pantry area and flops the vegetables
down on the counter. Holly puts the dishtowel down and
absently straightens some things on the food-laden table.

                      HOLLY
              (reacting)
          Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.

                      HANNAH
              (turning to look at
               Holly)
          You make it sound like, you know, I
          have no needs or something. You
          think I'm too self-sufficient?

                      HOLLY
              (stopping her mindless
               straightening at the
               table, reacting)
          Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant,
          you know.
              (walking offscreen to
               the sink area)
          Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you
          for so much. ""You're so giving.
          It's not a criticism. We love you.
          We're grateful.""

                      HANNAH
              (walking out of the
               pantry to the food-
               laden table)
          You're grateful, but you resent me.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen)
          Oh, wow! I don't want to have this
          conversation. I didn't do anything
          wrong.

Hannah angrily gathers up some spices from the table; Holly
walks back onscreen holding a silver ice bucket. She stops
at the corner of the table and faces Hannah.

                      HOLLY
              (onscreen)
          Y-you mentioned to me yourself that
          you and Elliot were having some
          problems.

                                                       175.

                      HANNAH
              (gesturing)
          Yeah, we're having some problems,
          but problems that are my
          business...which I don't see how you
          could know about in such detail.
          How does Lee know about these things?
          How? They're private!

Hannah picks up a large bowl and carries it, as well as her
armload of spices, into the pantry area.

                      HOLLY
              (turning to look at
               her sister as she
               walks past)
          Well, why don't you share them with
          us?

                       HANNAH
              (with her back to the
               camera)
          I don't...I don't want to bother
          everyone.

                      HOLLY
              (facing her sister's
               back)
          That's the point. I'd like to be
          bothered.

                      HANNAH
              (turning to look at
               Holly)
          I don't see how you could know about
          these things unless Elliot's been
          talking to you.

                      HOLLY
              (shaking her head)
          No, he hasn't. If I offended you,
          I'm sorry.

Hannah, reacting, puts the spices down on the pantry counter.

Holly turns away.

The film cuts to the dining room doorway. Guests can be
seen mingling and talking and helping themselves at a buffet
table in the living room. Lee and Elliot can be heard
offscreen as the camera slowly moves from the doorway across
the empty dining room to reveal them in the midst of an
intense conversation. The piano, as well as soft chatter,
is heard in the background.

                                                       176.

                      LEE
              (offscreen)
          It's over, Elliot. I don't know how
          to make it any clearer. It's over.
          I can't see you anymore.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          Uh...
              (onscreen, gesturing)
          I-I-I know. I deserve this.

                      LEE
              (touching her chest)
          Look, I'm just as much at fault.

                      ELLIOT
              (overlapping, gesturing)
          If-if-if you can believe I have such
          feelings for you!

                       LEE
          I've got to be honest with you. I
          met someone else. I've met someone
          else.
              (turning and walking
                away from Elliot)
          I...I told you I wasn't going to
          wait forever.

Lee goes over to an open door and closes it quickly.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen)
          But it hasn't been forever.
              (walking over to Lee
               at the just-closed
               door)

                      LEE
              (gesturing)
          It's been nearly a year since our
          first time and you're still married
          to my sister, which...I now realize
          is fine because you're probably much
          more in love with her than you know.

                      ELLIOT
              (shaking his head)
          Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.

                      LEE
              (overlapping, gesturing)
          Yeah. Uh, well, sure we did.
                      (MORE)

                                                       177.

                      LEE (CONT'D)
          An-an-and in a way you led me on,
          because I truly believed you were
          unhappy with Hannah. Otherwise, I
          would never have let myself be drawn
          in. I was very weak. So were you.
          Now I've met someone else.

The door opens and Mavis appears, holding a set of
candlesticks. She walks over to the dining room table, which
is already decked out with a floral centerpiece, glassware,
and china. She puts them down as Lee and Elliot stand
awkwardly near the door, waiting for her to leave.

                       LEE
              (to Mavis)
          Dinner soon?

                      MAVIS
          About fifteen minutes.

                      LEE
              (nodding)
          Uh-huh. Good.

Mavis leaves. Both Lee and Elliot quickly close the door
behind her and immediately pick up where they'd left off.

                      ELLIOT
          And you're in love overnight?

                      LEE
          I care a great deal about him, yes.

                      ELLIOT
              (trying to put his
               arm around Lee)
          Lee...

                      LEE
              (pulling back, flinging
               her hands)
          Ah, it's over! Elliot, I mean it.
          It's over!

They look at each other, reacting, as the film cuts back to
Hannah's kitchen. Norma's face can be seen in the porthole
window on the other side of the pantry's swinging door. She
looks around the kitchen, then opens the door and steps
inside. Holly stands nearby, working in the pantry area.

                                                       178.

                      NORMA
              (holding the door,
               half in and half out
               of the kitchen)
          Sweetheart, I loved your script.   I
          thought it was so clever.

                      HOLLY
              (turning to Norma,
               smiling, and holding
               a glass of wine)
          Well, you're my mother. Not
          everybody's gonna be such a sucker.

                      NORMA
              (gesturing)
          I particularly liked the character
          of the mother. Just a boozy old
          flirt with a filthy mouth.

Holly chuckles.

                      NORMA
          I'm so proud!

                      HOLLY
          Oh, Mom, thanks.

Norma steps back out of the kitchen, the door swinging shut
behind her. Holly looks at the door, sipping her wine, as
the movie cuts back to Hannah's living room. A chubby,
friendly uncle sits on a sofa, one child on his lap and
several others gathered cross-legged around him on the floor.

They lean on the coffee table, which is covered with glasses
and a bowl of chips. Other guests mingle in the background;
one couple enters the living room, smiling at the scene on
the sofa. Mavis crosses the well-lit foyer in the background
and opens the door to more guests. The piano plays on.

                      UNCLE
              (raising his bottle
               of beer to the
               children)
          Now here's a toast to Thanksgiving,
          all right?

The children mutter their enthusiastic agreement, picking up
their ""illicit"" glasses of beer.

                      UNCLE
          Are we supposed to have beer?
          Yeeeah!

                                                       179.

The uncle pours more beer from his bottle into the kids'
outstretched glasses. They cry indistinctly with excitement.

                      UNCLE
              (overlapping the
               children's squeals
               of delight)
          Let me at it!
              (to one of the little
               boys)
          How's that, Fletcher?

Laughing, he turns to the little girl sitting on his lap; he
clinks his bottle against the bottle she is holding, which
is almost as big as she is.

                      UNCLE
              (to the little girl)
          Doll? To Thanksgiving. Here's a
          little toast, doll.
              (clinking glasses)
          Come on. Bottoms up.

The uncle and the children happily drink their beer as the
movie cuts to a wall with subtly patterned wallpaper in
Hannah's bedroom. Her face moves on to the screen.

                        HANNAH
              (to the offscreen
                Elliot)
          Have you been talking to Holly or
          Lee about us? About our-our personal
          life?

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen)
          Me? Of course not.

                      HANNAH
          There's things Holly wrote about in
          her script about us that are
          so...personal they could only have
          come from you.

                      ELLIOT
              (offscreen)
          Look, I've got a splitting headache
          and I don't like being accused.

Hannah walks towards Elliot; he's in the bathroom standing
over the sink.

                                                       180.

                      HANNAH
              (gesturing)
          I'm not accusing. I'm asking. Do
          you...do you find me too...too giving?
              (closing the door of
               the bathroom slightly
               so only she is seen
               on the screen)
          Too-too-too competent? Too-too, I
          don't know, disgustingly perfect or
          something?

                      ELLIOT
          No.

Elliot walks from behind the partially closed door to an
offscreen medicine cabinet.

                      HANNAH
              (following Elliot and
               gesturing, talking
               to his back)
          Well, what is it then? What? Eh,
          what's come between us? How have I
          alienated you?

                      ELLIOT
              (taking a bottle of
               aspirin from the
               cabinet and walking
               back to the sink,
               gesturing)
          Hannah, my head is throbbing.

                      HANNAH
              (gesturing)
          You never want to talk about it.
          I-- Every time I bring it up, you-
          you change the subject. What is it?
          Do you-- We're communicating less
          and less. You sleep with me less
          and less.

                      ELLIOT
              (angrily turning to
               Hannah and pointing
               as she shouts)
          Hannah, I am very mixed up!   Now
          please!

Elliot turns back to the sink, once again obscured by the
partially closed door.

                                                       181.

                      HANNAH
              (reacting, her voice
               trembling slightly,
               and gesturing)
          Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind
          my back? Do you? You must. They-
          they seem to know so much about us.

                      ELLIOT
              (walking towards a
               towel rack and
               gesturing)
          Well, maybe I've asked advice once
          or twice or-or made a joke.

He dries his hands as Hannah, standing behind him, continues
to talk.

                      HANNAH
              (gesturing)
          Well, what do you do? Do-do-do you
          talk to Holly, or Lee, or what? Do
          you, do you, do you phone them?

                      ELLIOT
              (whirling around to
               face Hannah, snapping)
          Leave me alone, can you?!

He closes the door, briefly obscuring Hannah and himself
from view.

                      ELLIOT
              (continuing in a lower
               tone)
          Jesus, I've told you. I need someone
          I can matter to.

The camera moves behind the closed door, into the bathroom.

                      HANNAH
              (reacting, near tears)
          You matter to me. Completely.

                      ELLIOT
              (pausing, his voice
               rising again)
          It's hard to be around someone who
          gives so much and-and needs so little
          in return!

He opens the medicine cabinet and puts the aspirin bottle
back.

                                                            182.

                         HANNAH
                 (gesturing, pleading)
             But, look...I-I have enormous needs.

Elliot slams the medicine cabinet shut.

                         ELLIOT
                 (shouting)
             Well, I can't see them, and neither
             can Lee or Holly!

He leaves.    Hannah watches him go, reacting.     She is stunned.

                                                          CUT TO:

INT. HANNAH'S LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

The dark hallway is illuminated by light coming from the
offscreen foyer; pictures line the wall. Piano music is
still heard very softly in the background as Hannah, hugging
herself, walks slowly down the hallway into the living room.

She briefly looks around, lost in thought. She sits down
heavily, tiredly, on the arm of the couch as the movie cuts
to several framed photographs on the mantel. One shows Hannah
and Elliot on their wedding day. Another shows Elliot,
obscured in the shadows. Yet another has captured Norma as
a young girl. The camera, however, moves closer and closer
to a photograph showing Hannah, Lee, and Holly, the three
sisters, smiling into the camera. There is no sound.

                                                          CUT TO:

INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The film shows the bedroom night table, holding a small lamp,
a wooden box, a cast-iron fire truck, an ashtray, and glasses.
Elliot's pajama-clad arm moves into view. He turns off the
lamp; the room is now pitch-black.

                         HANNAH
                 (offscreen)
             It's so pitch-black tonight.   I feel
             lost.

                         ELLIOT
                 (offscreen)
             You're not lost.

Elliot turns the lamp back on, then turns to Hannah; she is
lying on her side of the bed, partially in shadow. He leans
over and kisses her.

                         ELLIOT
             I love you so much.

                                                       183.

They begin to kiss passionately as ""Bewitched"" starts to
play in the background.

                                                     CUT TO:

Lucky I ran into you.

""Bewitched"" continues as the film cuts to a busy nighttime
New York City street. Mickey, his hands in his pockets,
walks along the sidewalk, one person among many other
pedestrians. He pulls his coat tighter around him as he
walks. ""Bewitched"" continues to play as he passes Tower
Records' neon-lit window. He glances inside...and sees Holly,
her jacket flung over her shoulders, looking at some records.

Mickey walks through the revolving doors of Tower Records,
up a few stairs to the selling floor proper, and stops right
in front of Holly.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          Mmm, I don't know if you remember
          me, but we had the worst night of my
          life together.

                      HOLLY
              (laughing, holding
               some records)
          I remember you.

                      MICKEY
              (overlapping)
          Yes, you do recall, right?

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping, smiling
               and nodding)
          I recall you.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          I was walking past and I saw you in
          here...

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping, nodding)
          Yeah.

                      MICKEY
          ...and I thought I'd come in and...and
          we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...

                                        184.

            HOLLY
    (interrupting, laughing
     and shaking her head)
We didn't hit it off.

            MICKEY
    (overlapping, smiling)
Oh, that's putting it mildly. We
did everything but exchange gunshots.

               HOLLY
How are you?

             MICKEY
Good.   How are you?

               HOLLY
I'm fine.

            MICKEY
    (overlapping)
You look wonderful.

            HOLLY
    (chuckling, shaking
     her head)
Oh, no.

            MICKEY
    (overlapping,
     scratching his head)
Yeah, really. You do. You do.

               HOLLY
Yeah?

            MICKEY
It was a terrible evening.

            HOLLY
Yeah, it was.

             MICKEY
     (overlapping, gesturing)
Remember slamming the cab door in my
face and..
     (touching his nose as
      Holly laughs)
you know, it came very dangerously
close to emasculating my nose in
a...
     (touching his nose
      again)

                                                       185.

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping, laughing)
          I'd never do that.

                      MICKEY
              (continuing)
          ...in a really horrible way.

                      HOLLY
              (smiling, glancing
               away for a moment)
          Oh, well, that was a long time ago.

                      MICKEY
              (overlapping)
          You look wonderful.   You do.   What
          happened to you?

                      HOLLY
              (shrugging)
          People change...you know.

                      MICKEY
              (touching Holly's
               shoulder)
          Well, I hope you've changed.

                      HOLLY
          Yeah, I hope you have, too.

                      MICKEY
              (overlapping)
          I hope so for your sake, because,
          uh, your personality left something
          to be desired...

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping, shaking
               her head)
          Yeah, and for yours. I'm sure you've
          changed.

                      MICKEY
              (continuing)
          ...namely a personality.

Holly chuckles and turns to look at more records. She walks
down the aisle, occasionally glancing at the bins of records.

Mickey walks beside her.

                      MICKEY
          So how are you?

                                        186.

            HOLLY
    (smiling)
I'm okay.

            MICKEY
You didn't answer my question.
What are you doing?

            HOLLY
Oh, nothing much.    You know...

            MICKEY
    (interrupting)
Well...

            HOLLY
    (overlapping)
...just some stuff. A little of
this, a little of that, that's all.

            MICKEY
    (overlapping)
Yeah? Is that an embarrassing
question? Should I have not asked
it?

            HOLLY
    (laughing)
Probably not.

            MICKEY
Are you, are you out of work or
something?

            HOLLY
No, well...I've been trying to write.

            MICKEY
Have you?

             HOLLY
    (picking up a record
      and looking at it)
Yeah.

            MICKEY
Well, that's interesting.    Wh-what
kind of stuff?

            HOLLY
    (touching her chin
     for a moment)
Oh...well, you-you're not interested
in this.

                                         187.

            MICKEY
    (overlapping)
No, you can tell me.

             HOLLY
Come on.

             MICKEY
No, I am.   I am.

            HOLLY
    (overlapping)
Oh, no, millions of people come up
to you and say, ""Hey, I have something
I just wrote,"" right?

            MICKEY
Nobody ever said it.

             HOLLY
Really?

            MICKEY
    (overlapping)
This is it. Yeah.     This is really--

            HOLLY
    (interrupting, turning
     from the record bins
     to look at Mickey)
Well, wo-would you be willing to-to
read it? Something...that I wrote?

            MICKEY
    (nodding his head)
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it
would mean anything to you. I don't
know why it would.

            HOLLY
    (laughing, touching
     her face)
No, the reason I ask is--

            MICKEY
    (overlapping)
You've always hated my taste in the
past.

            HOLLY
    (pulling her jacket
     off her shoulders)
No, I haven't.

                                                       188.

                      MICKEY
          You have.

                      HOLLY
              (gesturing, looking
               at Mickey)
          I haven't. No, the reason why I ask
          is I think it might make a great,
          uh, television script, and, you know,
          you're so active in television, so--

                      MICKEY
              (chuckling, gesturing)
          I'm not anymore. I haven't, I haven't
          been in television for a year.

                      HOLLY
          You're kidding me.

                      MICKEY
              (overlapping)
          I've done no television whatsoever.
          No.

As Mickey continues to speak, Holly walks to another bin of
records, reacting to his words. She looks offscreen at him,
then down at some records. The camera follows her.

                      MICKEY
              (offscreen, continuing)
          I may, I may have to get back into
          it, 'cause my accountant says that
          I'm running out of dollars.
          But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just
          sort of dropped out for a year...

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping, nodding)
          Oh. Oh.

                      MICKEY
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          ...which is a long, dull story and I
          won't get into it. But--

Mickey walks back onscreen to Holly. The two of them are
partially obscured by a large white Jazz sign imprinted with
a large red circle as they continue their conversation.

                      HOLLY
              (interrupting)
          You're okay, though, huh?

                                                       189.

                       MICKEY
          I'm-- Yes. Yes, I'm fine.    I'm fine.
          How are you?

                      HOLLY
              (face offscreen,
               obscured by the sign)
          Oh, I'm fine.

                      MICKEY
          What...what about your script?
              (face offscreen
               obscured by the sign)
          So what's it about?

                      HOLLY
              (face offscreen)
          Well, I'd love it if you'd read it,
          actually, 'cause I really would value
          your opinion.

                      MICKEY
              (face offscreen)
          You have to remember, we-we-we didn't
          agree on one thing.

They emerge from behind the Jazz sign, still walking, still
talking.

                      HOLLY
              (smiling, gesturing)
          But you have to remember while you're
          reading and you're cursing my name,
          you know, that this is my first
          script. Well, it's not my first
          script.

                         MICKEY
          Hmm.

                      HOLLY
              (touching her face)
          Actually, my first script was about
          Hannah and her husband, but, uh...

                         MICKEY
          Yeah.

                      HOLLY
          ...Hannah read it, she got really
          angry, and... you know, then I felt
          badly, so I--

She picks up a record.

                                                       190.

                      MICKEY
              (overlapping)
          Oh, well, God, I can imagine what
          you wrote.

                      HOLLY
          Oh, no! It wasn't anything bad.
          But she just... you know. I don't
          know.

Mickey pulls out a record and looks at it.

                      MICKEY
          Really?

                      HOLLY
          So, uh...I threw it out, but I have
          this other one.

Holly looks hopefully at Mickey.

                      MICKEY
          Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if
          you want me to, I'll read it.

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping, gesturing)
          Oh, gosh, I don't know.
              (pausing)
          Well, could I come over tomorrow and
          read it to you?

                      MICKEY
              (chuckling)
          Come over tomorrow and read it to
          me?

Holly laughs, embarrassed, as Mickey puts the record he's
been looking at back in the bin.

                      MICKEY
          You must be joking. I've been doing
          all my own reading since I was
          forty...you know.

                        HOLLY
               (laughing, looking at
                Mickey)
          Hmm. I think it's lucky I ran into
          you.
               (laughing)
          Maybe.

                                                       191.

                      MICKEY
              (laughing)
          Well, what about me?

                      HOLLY
              (chuckling, waving
               her arm)
          Oh, well.

                      MICKEY
              (overlapping, gesturing)
          I should have kept going. I-I have
          a sneaking feeling, a nagging
          sensation I should've kept walking
          and...

Holly chuckles, looking off for a moment.

                      MICKEY
              (continuing, looking
               at Holly)
          ...and not begun this conversation.

There is a brief pause and the movie cuts to:

INT. MICKEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

The screen shows a chaise in Mickey's apartment; an ashtray
on a stand sits nearby. The camera moves down the chaise,
past several piles of books, to Mickey's coffee table. He
sits, picking at his fingers and listening, on the edge of
the table in front of Holly, who is sitting cross-legged on
the floor, propped up with a pillow, reading her script aloud.

                      HOLLY
              (offscreen, as the
               camera moves across
               the room towards her
               and Mickey, reading)
          ""We all go through life playing the
          hand we're dealt. Craig: And what
          hand were you dealt?
              (onscreen now)
          ""Emily: I'm two high pair, maybe
          even aces up. The problem is, you've
          got three deuces.""

Holly closes the script and looks up at Mickey.

                      HOLLY
          That's the end.

Mickey smiles and shrugs, not knowing what to say.

                                        192.

            HOLLY
No, you can tell me straight. It's
okay. Just, you know, tell me what
you think.

            MICKEY
    (shaking his head,
     shrugging)
It's great. I swea-- I'm-- I'm,
tch, I'm speechless. I was...I was
not in the mood to listen to this
thing now.
    (sighing)
I don't know what to say. I'm moved
and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you
know, I was on the edge of my seat.
I just think it's wonderful!
I'm, I'm totally...stunned. This is
not an insult. I'm amazed that you
can...

            (sighing)
It was-- I just thought it was great.

            HOLLY
    (reacting)
Really?

            MICKEY
    (grunting and gesturing)
Yes! I was abso-- And...w-
what...made you think of that climax
scene where the, where the...
architect is walking home with his
actress girlfriend and-and the ex-
wife who's schizophrenic jumps out
of the bushes and stabs him to death?

            HOLLY
    (laughing and nodding)
Oh, it just came to me one day.

            MICKEY
    (gesturing)
Well, it was just fabulous!   I'm, I,
you know...

            HOLLY
    (gasping, hitting her
     forehead with her
     hand)
Oh, gosh, you really think I can
write?

                                                       193.

                      MICKEY
              (gesturing)
          I thought it was wonder-- There's
          maybe one or two things in there
          that I would do differently myself,
          but...

                      HOLLY
              (gasping and nodding)
          Right.

                      MICKEY
              (continuing)
          ...but who cares? It was just--
              (gesturing)
          It was fabulous.

                        HOLLY
                (chuckling)
          Oh!

                      MICKEY
              (smiling and shaking
               his head)
          Fabulous, I mean it! I'm so
          impressed.

Holly, thrilled with Mickey's overwhelming response, stands
up, her hand on her head.

Unable to contain herself, she begins to walk up and down
the room, holding her script. The camera follows her; Mickey
is now offscreen.

                      HOLLY
              (laughing)
          Oh, God!

                      MICKEY
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          I am. You-you made my day.

                      HOLLY
              (gasping)
          Oh, wow!

                      MICKEY
              (offscreen)
          It was just great. Uh, I was all
          set...I was set to be bored stiff.

                                                       194.

                      HOLLY
              (grinning, looking at
               the offscreen Mickey)
          Uh, gee. Would you like to have
          lunch? Uh, uh...

                      MICKEY
              (offscreen)
          I-I would love to talk to you about,
          uh, that script. I-I, you know, I
          think maybe that we could do something
          with it.

                      HOLLY
              (nodding)
          Okay, and listen, I would like to
          hear what made you suddenly decide
          to drop out of life.

                      MICKEY
              (offscreen)
          Oh, who cares?

                      HOLLY
              (gesturing)
          Y-you used to-- Oh, no! Yeah, I
          care. You used to be so ambitious
          and...
              (pausing, grinning)
          God, you really liked it?!

""You Made Me Love You"" starts to play as the movie cuts to
the street outside Mickey's apartment house, an old building
complete with a red entrance door and a gray, weather-beaten
ade. Trees line the sidewalk. Holly and Mickey emerge from
the door and walk up the street, revealing a whole row of
similar apartment buildings. They pass a few other people
as they walk.

The film then moves to the outside of a charming glass and
stainedwood caf. Through the window, Holly and Mickey can
be seen having lunch. Holly is talking animatedly; Mickey
takes a sip of coffee. Some people pass by.

Next, the film cuts to an almost isolated path in Central
Park, complete, with old-fashioned streetlamps and scattered
leaves. Holly and Mickey stroll into view, deep in
conversation.

                      HOLLY
              (gesturing)
          Gosh, you really went through a
          crisis, you know that? H-how did
          you get over it?
                      (MORE)

                                                        195.

                      HOLLY (CONT'D)
          I mean, when I ran into you, you
          seemed, you seemed just perfectly
          fine. Well, you seem fine now.

                      MICKEY
          Well...
              (chuckling)
          I'll tell you.
              (sighing)
          One day about a month ago...

The film abruptly cuts to Mickey's flashback, a visual
counterpoint to the story he is telling Holly. A close-up
of a nervous, perspiring, and panting Mickey alone in his
apartment appears on the screen as his voice is heard.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          ...I really hit bottom. You know, I
          just felt that in a Godless universe,
          I didn't want to go on living. Now
          I happen to own this rifle...
              (coughing)
          Mickey raises the barrel of a rifle
          to his forehead. He shuts his eyes
          tightly.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          ...which I loaded, believe it or
          not, and pressed it to my forehead.
          And I remember thinking, at the time,
          I'm gonna kill myself. Then I
          thought...what if I'm wrong?
          What if there is a God? I mean,
          after all, nobody really knows that.

The camera moves past the desperate Mickey to a mirror on
the wall behind him. Its reflection shows his spiral
staircase and some standing lamps. A clock faintly ticks.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          But then I thought, no. You know,
          maybe is not good enough. I want
          certainty or nothing. And I remember
          very clearly the clock was ticking,
          and I was sitting there frozen, with
          the gun to my head, debating whether
          to shoot.

The gun goes off with a loud bang.   The mirror shatters.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          All of a sudden, the gun went off.

                                                        196.

Mickey, holding the rifle, is seen running over to the
shattered mirror. The sounds of his excited neighbors, their
shouting, a knocking door, are heard as he continues his
tale.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          I had been so tense, my finger had
          squeezed the trigger inadvertently...

                      NEIGHBOR #1
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          What's happening? Wh-wh-what's going
          on?

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
              (continuing)
          ...but I was perspiring so much, the
          gun had slid off my forehead and
          missed me.

                      NEIGHBOR #2
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          I don't know. I heard a gun.     Is
          everything all right?

Mickey, still brandishing the rifle, runs into his sunlit
living room. He looks around frantically, his shirt loose.

Finally, he throws the rifle down between the sofa and the
coffee table. The gun goes off a second time. Mickey,
standing nearby, jumps, his hands flying to his head. The
doorbell rings; the neighbors begin pounding at the door.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          And suddenly, neighbors were, were,
          pounding on the door, and-and I don't
          know, the whole scene was just
          pandemonium. And, uh, you know, and
          I-I-I-I-I ran to the door.

Mickey runs offscreen briefly to answer the door.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          I-I-I-I didn't know what to say.
          You know, I was, I was embarrassed
          and confused, and my-my-my mind was
          r-r-racing a mile a minute...

He returns onscreen, panting; he looks frantically once again
around the living room.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          ...and I-I jus knew one thing.

The film cuts to a West Side street.   It's an overcast day.

                                                       197.

Mickey, walking slowly along the sidewalk, passes several
other pedestrians and numerous storefronts, including Klein's
Pharmacy and a ""Bar-B-Q"" take out. Occasionally, he is
obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the street;
a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          I...I-I-I-I had to get out of that
          house. I had to just get out in the
          fresh air and-and clear my head.
          And I remember very clearly. I walked
          the streets. I walked and I walked.
          I-I didn't know what was going through
          my mind. It all seemed so violent
          and un-unreal to me. And I
          wandered...

The movie cuts to the exterior of the Metro movie theater,
with its smoked glass entrance doors and its Art Deco feel.

An old publicity photo hangs inside. Mickey's reflection is
seen at the almost-transparent doors, as well as the
reflection of the street and various cars whizzing by. His
reflection walks towards the theater entrance; he continues
his story.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          ...for a long time on the Upper West
          Side, you know, an-and it must have
          been hours! You know, my, my feet
          hurt. My head was, was pounding,
          and, and I had to sit down. I went
          into a movie house. I-I didn't know
          what was playing or anything.

Mickey walks into the movie house. He is seen through the
glass doors, which still reflect the street and traffic
outside. He makes his way through the lobby into the actual
theater.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          I just, I just needed a moment to
          gather my thoughts and, and be
          logical, and, and put the world back
          into rational perspective.

                                                       198.

The film abruptly cuts to the theater's black-and-white
screen, where the Marx Brothers, in Duck Soup, play the
helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live
xylophone. The sounds of the ""xylophone"" are heard as the
movie cuts to the darkened theater, where Mickey slowly sits
down in a balcony seat. The ""xylophone"" music stops and
changes to ""Hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-ho"" as sung
by the Marx Brothers and ensemble in the movie. The singing
continues faintly in the background as Mickey continues his
tale:

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          And I went upstairs to the balcony,
          and I sat down
              (sighing)
          and, you know, the movie was a-a-a
          film that I'd seen many times in my
          life since I was a kid, an-and I
          always u-uh, loved it. And, you
          know, I'm, I'm watching these people
          up on the screen, and I started
          getting hooked o-on the film, you
          know?

The film cuts back to the black-and-white movie screen as
Mickey continues to talk. The Marx Brothers, as well as the
hundred-odd other cast members in Duck Soup, are kneeling
and bowing as they sing ""Hidee-hidee-ho."" They kick their
heels up in the air. They sway back and forth, hands clasped,
singing ""Oh-h-h-h-h-h...""

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          ...And I started to feel how can you
          even think of killing yourself?
          I mean, isn't it so stupid? I mean,
          l-look at all the people up there on
          the screen. You know, they're real
          funny, and, and what if the worst is
          true?

The movie cuts back to Mickey, sitting almost obscured in
the dark theater. The Oh-h-h-h-h-h's coming from the
offscreen movie are heard as he continues to speak.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          What if there's no God, and you only
          go around once and that's it?
          Well, you know, don't you want to be
          part of the experience? You know,
          what the hell, it-i-it's not all a
          drag. And I'm thinking to myself,
          geez, I should stop ruining my life...

                                                          199.

As Mickey talks, the film cuts back to the antics of the
Marx Brothers on the black-and-white theater screen. The
four brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting,
their voices indistinct over Mickey's narration.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          ...searching for answers I'm never
          gonna get, and just enjoy it while
          it lasts. And...you know...

The film is back on Mickey's dark form in the audience.

                      MICKEY (V.O.)
          ...after, who knows? I mean, you
          know, maybe there is something.
          Nobody really knows. I know, I know
          ""maybe"" is a very slim reed to hang
          your whole life on, but that's the
          best we have. And...then, I started
          to sit back, and I actually began to
          enjoy myself.

As Mickey continues, the film cuts back to Duck Soup on the
black-and-white screen. The Marx Brothers are sitting on a
judge's bench, playing banjos and singing with the other
cast members. They jump down from the bench, still singing.

Their voices swell.

MARX BROTHERS & COMPANY

""Oh, Freedonia Oh, don't you cry for me They'll be coming
around the mountain...""

The Marx Brothers kneel, strumming their banjos, and the
movie cuts back to Central Park. The flashback is over.

Mickey and Holly continue their stroll as ""You Made Me Love
You"" begins to play in the background. They pass some people,
a cluster of buildings that look like castles, and the
Manhattan skyline as seen through the trees, as the camera
moves back, farther and farther away from them, showing a
beautiful Central Park, frozen in time.

                       HOLLY
              (gesturing)
          Um...look, there's something I've,
          uh, that's been bothering me for a
          long time, and I just thought I'd
          just tell you what it was and just
          sort of clear the deck here, and
              (chuckling)
          that's this.

                                                         200.

                      MICKEY
              (mumbling)
          Oh, yeah? What?

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping)
          That I've always regretted the way I
          behaved that evening we went out,
          and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd
          tell you that because I really made
          a fool out of myself.

                      MICKEY
          Oh, don't be silly!   No!   Don't be
          ridiculous.

                      HOLLY
              (overlapping)
          It's all right.

                      MICKEY
          I was the, I was... You know, it was
          my fault. I--
              (inhaling)
          Holly laughs.

                      MICKEY
          So, so you want to go out to dinner
          again? I mean, is that, is that...
          Have, you have any interest in that,
          or...

                       HOLLY
          Sure.   Sure, uh, yes.

                      MICKEY
              (overlapping)
          Do you? I mean, are you, are you,
          are you, are you free this evening?

                       HOLLY
          Yeah.

They stroll offscreen. ""You Made Me Love You"" grows louder

                                         AND THE FILM CUTS TO:

One year later.

                                                       CUT TO:

                                                       201.

INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING - NIGHT

A large, perfectly roasted turkey on a serving plate briefly
fills the screen as the camera moves across the food-laden
table in Hannah's kitchen, past an electric mixer, several
bowls, spices, tomatoes, and parsley, to reveal Evan walking
through the doorway.

                      EVAN
              (holding a drink)
          I want ice! Who's got some--
              (pointing to an ice
               bucket on the table)
          Oh, there it is.

                      HANNAH
              (offscreen, overlapping)
          It's on the table, Dad.

The sounds of Thanksgiving guests in the other room are dimly
heard; ""You Made Me Love You"" continues softly in the
background. Mavis passes the table, licking some food off
her hand. Hannah, in the background, is busy by the stove.

                      EVAN
              (putting ice into his
               glass)
          Hey, where's Holly? She's late.

As Mavis leaves the kitchen, Lee enters, carrying some empty
glasses.

                      LEE
              (walking briskly to
               the sink)
          Hey, Hannah, did you read that last
          thing Holly wrote? It was great.

She's really developed.

                      HANNAH
              (offscreen, in another
               area of the kitchen)
          I know, she...she really writes good
          dialogue.

                      LEE
              (turning to the
               offscreen Hannah)
          Yeah. I'll get some ice.

Lee walks off, drying her wet hands in the air. Hannah, in
a silk dress, moves onscreen, going to the table and pouring
herself a glass of wine as Norma enters the kitchen.

                                                       202.

                      NORMA
          Hannah, can I tell everybody you're
          going to play Desdemona?

Norma walks over to a glass-doored cabinet and takes out a
bottle of gin.

                      HANNAH
              (taking a big sip of
               her wine)
          Oh, Mom, it's only television.
              (beginning to mash
               some sweet potatoes
               in a bowl on the
               table)

                       NORMA
              (gesturing with the
               bottle)
          Yes, but it's public television.
          And to me, Shakespeare doesn't get
          any greater than Othello. You with
          some big black stud! I love it!

Norma unscrews the liquor bottle and pours some into her
empty glass as Hannah stops her mashing, reacting.

                      HANNAH
              (gasping and laughing)
          Oh, Mom!

                      EVAN
              (overlapping, reacting)
          Oh, honey!

The movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between
the dining room and the living room. Upbeat jazz plays over
the low din of the party. Two women stand by the partially
set dining room table, chatting and arranging some plates,
as Elliot strolls into view, sipping a drink. He passes the
women and walks through the doorway into the living room,
nodding hello to a guest who is walking the other way.

He enters the living room, smiling. It is crowded with
guests; Hannah's children play in their midst. One of
Hannah's boys grabs Elliot's arm. They playfully ""spar"" for
a moment before Elliot laughingly shakes him off, continuing
on his way into a connecting room. He stops at the doorway,
looking at the crowd. The camera shows his point of view:

Guests stand in clusters, enjoying themselves; one woman
chats with a little boy; another woman, carrying a drink,
walks over to a group of other guests.

                                                         203.

The film then cuts back briefly to Elliot, holding his drink
and looking straight ahead, as it shows his point of view
once more. This time he sees a smiling Lee and Doug, talking
animatedly; a few guests are seen in the background.

Elliot's voice is heard over a close-up of the couple.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          Oh, Lee, you are something.

Lee and Doug kiss each other.   They continue talking.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          You look very beautiful. Marriage
          agrees with you. Everything that
          happened between us
              (pausing)
          seems more and more hazy.

As Lee takes a sip of her drink, the movie cuts back to
Elliot, standing in the doorway and still staring straight
ahead. The camera moves in closer to his face as he talks
over the scene.

                       ELLIOT (V.O.)
          I acted like such a fool. I don't
          know what came over me. That complete
          conviction that I couldn't live
          without you.

The film quickly cuts to a brief look at Lee and Doug, still
talking animatedly and smiling. Lee gently pushes back Doug's
hair.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
          What did I put us both through?
          And Hannah...

The camera moves back to Elliot.

                      ELLIOT (V.O.)
              (continuing)
          ...who as you once said, I love much
          more than I realized.

After pausing for a moment on Elliot's face, the film cuts
to the foyer, where two boys and a girl gather by the door.

One boy opens it, revealing Holly. She joyfully enters the
apartment, greeting each child with an enthusiastic kiss.

                      HOLLY
              (kissing the children)
          Hi! How are you!
                      (MORE)

                                                      204.

                         HOLLY (CONT'D)
                 (kissing)
             Happy Thanksgiving!
                 (kissing)

                           BOY #1
             Hi!

                         HOLLY
             I didn't miss dinner, did I?

                           CHILDREN
                   (overlapping, talking
                    at once)
             No!

The jazz ends as the record scratches and stops. Evan's
rendition of ""Isn't It Romantic"" is heard on the piano as
Holly, shrugging the strap of her pocketbook off her shoulder,
walks towards the living room. She is stopped by three guests--
two women, one of them wearing glasses, and a man--who are
coming out of the room.

                         HOLLY
                 (smiling)
             Huh? Hi, Marge.

                         FEMALE GUEST #1
                 (overlapping)
             You look lovely.

They kiss.

                         FEMALE GUEST #2
                 (overlapping, hugging
                  Holly)
             Hello, darling.

                         HOLLY
             Happy Thanksgiving.

                         FEMALE GUEST #2
                 (overlapping)
             Good to see you. Same to you.

                         HOLLY
                 (hugging the man)
             Hello.

                                                       205.

The movie cuts to Hannah, leaning contentedly against a
doorway into the living room and listening to the offscreen
Evan play the piano. Elliot, holding his drink, walks over
to her. They look at each other for a beat; Elliot then
hugs Hannah, pulling her towards him. She leans her head on
his shoulder, fingering his jacket lapel. They look offscreen
together, happily, intimately, at the offscreen guests, as
the camera moves across the room, past a few guests, to reveal
Evan sitting at the piano. Norma sits at his side, one arm
resting on the piano. She holds a drink and looks off in
the distance, mouthing the words to ""Isn't It Romantic.""

The camera then moves to the doorway in the living room,
where a man, holding a drink, enters and joins the happy
crowd. Evan can be seen in the background, playing his song.

A child plays near the coffee table.

The camera continues to move past the doorway, past a huge
grandfather clock, to a second doorway leading to the den.

Here, more guests are gathered; a child sits in a small chair
by the sofa. He sips a soda as female guest #2 enters the
room and crouches down next to him, smiling. She waves to
him. He waves back as the camera continues to move past the
doorway to reveal Holly, standing in front of a hallway
mirror, fixing her earrings. Mavis can be seen in the
background, through the doorway into the dining room, lighting
the candles on the table. She dims the lights, darkening
the room and the hallway where Holly stands in a warm
candlelit glow. Mavis leaves the dining room and passes
Holly.

                      HOLLY
              (still fixing her
               earrings, to Mavis)
          It's beautiful.

Mavis walks off. Holly, reflected in the mirror, begins
fluffing her hair as Mickey enters and wraps his arms around
her from behind. The camera stays focused on the mirror;
both Holly and Mickey are now seen in its reflection.

                      MICKEY
              (smacking his lips)
          Now don't get nervous. It's just
          your husband.

                        HOLLY
                (grinning)
          Hi.

                        MICKEY
          Hi.
                        (MORE)

                                                        206.

                      MICKEY (CONT'D)
              (kissing Holly)
          How you doin'?

                        HOLLY
              (nestling against
                Mickey)
          Okay.

                      MICKEY
          When'd you get here?

                      HOLLY
          Just a few minutes ago.

                      MICKEY
          Oh.
              (kissing her again)
          You look so beautiful.

Mickey continues to kiss Holly.   She responds, sighing and
closing her eyes.

                      HOLLY
          Thanks.

                      MICKEY
              (kissing Holly's neck)
          You know, I was talking with your
          father before...and I was telling
          him that
              (kissing)
          it's ironic. I-I used to always
          have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and
          I never thought
              (kissing)
          that I could love anybody else.
              (kissing)
          And here it is, years later and I'm
          married to you
              (kissing)
          and completely in love with you.
              (kissing)
          The heart is a very, very resilient
          little muscle.
              (kissing)
          It really is. I...
              (kissing)
          It'd made a great story, I think.
          A guy marries one sister...
              (kissing)
          doesn't work out...
              (kissing)
          many years later...
              (kissing)

                                                       207.

                      HE WINDS UP
              (inhaling)
          married to the other sister.   It's,
          you know, it's a...

                         HOLLY
                 (fondling Mickey's
                  arm, smiling)
          Tch.

                      MICKEY
              (overlapping)
          I don't know how you're gonna top
          that.

Mickey continues to kiss Holly's neck; he chuckles.

                      HOLLY
              (kissing Mickey's
               cheek)
          Mickey?

                      MICKEY
              (kissing Holly's neck)
          Mmm, what?

                      HOLLY
          I'm pregnant.

The mirror shows Mickey pulling away slightly, reacting.

They look at each other at arm's length, Holly grinning.

Mickey in shock, then embrace and kiss passionately, tighter
and tighter, as the music swells...

And the credits appear, white on a black screen.

                             THE END

1   EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - DUSK                                    1

    JUNO MacGUFF stands on a placid street in a nondescript
    subdivision, facing the curb. It’s FALL. Juno is sixteen years
    old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid. She winces and shields
    her eyes from the glare of the sun. The object of her rapt
    attention is a battered living room set, abandoned curbside by
    its former owners. There is a fetid-looking leather recliner, a
    chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless latchhooked rug
    featuring a roaring tiger.

                         JUNO V.O.
               It started with a chair.


2   INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MOLD-O’-RIFFIC BASEMENT- NIGHT            2

    FLASHBACK - Juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow. He’s
    sitting in an overstuffed chair. She slowly, clumsily lowers
    herself onto his lap.

    A   60’s Brazilian track plays from a vintage record player.

                         WHISPERED VOICE
               Do you know how long I’ve wanted
               this?

                         JUNO
               Yeah.

                         WHISPERED VOICE
               Wizard.


3   EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - CONTINUED                               3

    A DOG barks, jarring Juno back to reality.

                         JUNO
               Quiet, Banana. Hey, shut your gob
               for a second, okay?

    We see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away
    from the abandoned living room set. The dog yaps again.

                         JUNO (V.O.)
               This is the most magnificent discarded
               living room set I’ve ever seen.

    She swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and
    wipes her mouth with the back of her hand.

    BEGIN ANIMATED TITLE SEQUENCE:

    Juno marching down various street, pumping her arms like a
    jogger and chugging intermittently from the huge carton of
    juice. We watch her breathlessly navigate suburbia, clearly
    on a mission.

6   EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY                                          6

    Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the
    main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk.

    The automatic doors of the store part to reveal Juno’s
    flushed serious face. She carelessly flings the empty juice
    container over her shoulder and onto the curb. A group of
    DROPOUTS with skateboards near the entrance glare at her.

    She enters the DRUGSTORE.


7   INT. DRUGSTORE - CONTINUOUS                                   7

    ROLLO, the eccentric drugstore clerk, sneers at Juno from
    behind the counter. He wears a polyester uniform vest.

                        ROLLO
              Well, well. If it isn’t MacGuff the
              Crime Dog! Back for another test?

                        JUNO
              I think the last one was defective.
              The plus sign looked more like a
              division sign.

    Rollo regards her with intense skepticism.

                        JUNO
              I remain unconvinced.

    Rollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach.

                        ROLLO
              This is your third test today, Mama
              Bear. Your eggo is preggo, no doubt
              about it!

    An eavesdropping TOUGH GIRL wearing an oversized jacket and
    lots of makeup gapes at Juno from the beauty aisle.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

       Juno - Production Revised Yellow - 3/05/07            3.
7   CONTINUED:                                                 7

                         TOUGH GIRL
               Three times? Oh girl, you are way
               pregnant. It’s easy to tell. Is
               your nipples real brown?

    A pile of stolen COSMETICS falls out of the girl’s jacket and
    clatters to the floor.

                         TOUGH GIRL
               Balls!

    Juno crosses and crosses her legs awkwardly, hopping. It’s
    obvious she has to use the bathroom urgently.

                         ROLLO
               Maybe you’re having twins. Maybe
               your little boyfriend’s got mutant
               sperms and he knocked you up twice!

                         JUNO
               Silencio! I just drank my weight in
               Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.

    Rollo sighs and slips her the bathroom key. Juno races down
    one of the aisles.

                         ROLLO
               Well, you know where the lavatory is.
                   (Calling after her) )
               You pay for that pee stick when
               you’re done! Don’t think it’s yours
               just because you’ve marked it with
               your urine!

                         JUNO
               Jesus, I didn’t say it was.

                         ROLLO
               Well, it’s not. You’re not a lion
               in a pride!
                   (to himself)
               These kids, acting like lions with
               their unplanned pregnancies and
               their Sunny Delights.


8   INT.   DRUGSTORE - BATHROOM - DAY                             8

    In the dim, reeking public bathroom, Juno hovers over the
    commode with her boxer shorts around her ankles. She clumsily
    tries to use the pregnancy test.




                                                       (CONTINUED)

        Juno - Production Revised Yellow - 3/05/07            4.
8    CONTINUED:                                                 8

     We see the test box sitting on the sink. It’s a TeenWave
     Discount Pregnancy Test. The accompanying outdated package
     photo is of a shrugging 80s teen with a resigned expression.
     The fine print on the box reads “From the makers of Sun-Glitz
     Lightening Hair Spritz!”


9    INT. DRUGSTORE - FRONT COUNTER - DAY                          9

     Juno holds the developing test in her hand and slaps the open
     test box on the front counter. Rollo scans it and bags it
     indifferently.

                         JUNO
               Oh, and this too.

     She places a giant licorice Super Rope on the counter.

                         ROLLO
               So what’s the prognosis, Fertile
               Myrtle? Minus or plus?

                         JUNO
               (examining stick) I don’t know.
               It’s not...seasoned yet. Wait. Huh.
               Yeah, there’s that pink plus sign
               again. God, it’s unholy.

     She shakes the stick desperately in an attempt to skew the
     results. Shake. Shake. Nothing.

                         ROLLO
               That ain’t no Etch-a-Sketch. This
               is one doodle that can’t be undid,
               homeskillet.


10   EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - EVENING                                 10

     Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house,
     gnawing on the Super Rope. She stops and loops the Super Rope
     over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to fashion
     a noose.

     Juno trudges toward her HOUSE. The yard is a wild tangle of
     prairie grass and wild flowers.

14   INT.   MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO’S BEDROOM - NIGHT                14

     Juno’s BEDROOM is decorated with punk posters: The Damned,
     The Germs, the Stooges, Television, Richard Hell, etc.

     She picks up a hamburger-shaped phone to call her best
     friend, LEAH.

17   INT. LEAH’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                          17

     LEAH’s room is cluttered with the sentimental junk that
     certain girls love to hoard. The PHONE rings.

                          LEAH
                    (answering phone)
                Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.

                          JUNO
                I am a suicide risk.

                          LEAH
                Is this Juno?

                          JUNO
                No it’s Morgan Freeman. Got any
                bones that need collecting?

                          LEAH
                Only the one in my pants.

                          JUNO
                    (in low tones)
                Dude, I’m pregnant.

                          LEAH
                Maybe it’s just a food baby. Did
                you have a big lunch?

                          JUNO
                It’s not a food baby. I took three
                pregnancy tests today. I am
                definitely up the spout.

                         LEAH
               How did you even generate enough
               pee for three pregnancy tests?

                         JUNO
               I drank like ten tons of Sunny
               Delight. Anyway, yeah. I’m
               pregnant. And you’re shockingly
               cavalier.

                         LEAH
               Is this for real? Like for real,
               for real?

                         JUNO
               Unfortunately, yes.

                         LEAH
               Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket
               Thailand!

                         JUNO
               That’s the kind of emotion I was
               looking for in the first take.

                         LEAH
               Well, are you going to go to
               Havenbrooke or Women Now for the
               abortion? You need a note from your
               parents for Havenbrooke.

                         JUNO
               I know. Women Now, I guess. The
               commercial says they help women now.

                         LEAH
               Want me to call for you? I called
               for Becky last year.

                         JUNO
               Eh, I’ll call them myself. But I do
               need your help with something very
               urgent.


18   EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - NIGHT                                18

     Leah and Juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well-
     manicured suburban lawn. They make a formidable team.

                         LEAH
               Heavy lifting can only help you at
               this point.

                         JUNO
               That is sick, man.

     Leah busts a gut laughing. It’s a stunningly accurate
     portrayal of Bleeker’s parents.

                         LEAH
               So, you were bored? Is that how
               this blessed miracle came to be?

                         JUNO
               Nah, it was a premeditated act. The
               sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.

                         LEAH
               When did you decide you were going
               to do Bleeker?

                         JUNO
               Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.


19   INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - SPANISH CLASS - DAY - (FLASHBACK)19

     Bleeker and Juno are sitting at their desks, listening to a
     teacher lecturing about spanish. Bleeker discreetly pushes a
     POSTCARD to Juno with his foot. She picks it up off the
     floor, reads it, then looks at Bleeker, who is watching the
     teacher obediently.


20   EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - NIGHT                              20

               Aha! You love him.

                         JUNO
               It’s extremely complicated, and I’d
               rather not talk about it in my
               fragile state.

     She hefts a coffee table with her bare hands. She’s wearing

26    EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MORNING                                26

      PAUL BLEEKER steps onto the front porch of his house for
      early morning track practice. He wears a cross country
      uniform that reads “DANCING ELK CONDORS.” He is eating some
      kind of microwaved snack gimmick.

      Bleeker is startled to discover that Juno is outside waiting
      for him. She has somehow arranged the living room set on the
      front lawn, and is seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe
      officiously.

                             JUNO
                Hey Bleek.

                          BLEEKER
                Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.

                          JUNO
                Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.

                             BLEEKER
                Cool.

                          JUNO
                Your shorts are looking especially
                gold today.

               So, guess what?

                   (shrugs)
               I don’t know...

                         JUNO
               I’m pregnant.

     Stunned silence. Juno pops up the footrest of the recliner
     and leans back comfortably.

                         BLEEKER
               I guess so.
                   (fidgeting)
               What are you going to do?

     The Dancing Elk Prep cross country team runs past Bleeker’s
     house in a thundering herd, wearing a motley assortment of
     warm-ups. Their momentum stirs the crackling fall leaves.
     They wave and holler at Bleeker and Juno.

                         JUNO V.O.
               When I see them all running like
               that, with their things bouncing
               around in their shorts, I always
               picture them naked, even if I don’t
               want to. I have intrusive thoughts
               all the time.

               I’m supposed to be running.

                         JUNO
               I know.

     There’s an awkward silence.

                         BLEEKER
               So, what do you think we should
               do?

                I thought I might, you know, nip it
                in the bud before it gets worse.
                Because I heard in health class that
                pregnancy often results in an infant.

                          BLEEKER
                Yeah, typically. That’s what
                happens when our moms and teachers
                get pregnant.

                          JUNO
                So that’s cool with you, then?

                          BLEEKER
                Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do
                what you think is right.

                          JUNO
                I’m real sorry I had sex with you.
                I know it wasn’t your idea.

                          BLEEKER
                Whose idea was it?

      Juno pushes her crappy bike into the bike rack and winds a
      lock around it. In the background, a group of 3 NERDS play a
      live-action RPG.

                          NERD
                You did not! You don’t have the
                armor. That Orc Armor you bought

30   INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     30

     Juno rummages through her locker, which is plastered with
     photos of Leah and Bleeker, plus a giant poster of Iggy Pop
     in his heyday.

     She grabs a dilapidated physics textbook. A few pages slip
     out. STEVE RENDAZO (the same asshole who harassed her as she
     walked to the drugstore) passes by in the hallway.

                         STEVE RENDAZO
               Hey, your book fell apart!

                         JUNO
               Yeah.

                         STEVE RENDAZO
               It must have looked at your face.
               PWAH!

     He high-fives his klatch of buddies and moves along.

                         JUNO V.O.
               The funny thing is that Steve Rendazo
               secretly wants me. Jocks like him
               always want freaky girls. Girls with
               horn-rimmed glasses and vegan
               footwear and Goth makeup. Girls who
               play the cello and wear Converse All-
               Stars and want to be children’s
               librarians when they grow up. Oh
               yeah, jocks eat that shit up.

     We see Steve looking back at Juno for a brief second with
     mixed feelings.

                         JUNO V.O.
               They just won’t admit it, because
               they’re supposed to be into perfect
               cheerleaders like Leah. Who,
               incidentally, is into teachers.

     We see Leah at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly
     with a paunchy middle-aged teacher, KEITH.

                         LEAH

     STUDENTS bustle in, as the teacher, MR. TINKER tries to
     maintain order. Juno heads toward her desk and sets down her
     bag.

                          MR. TINKER
                People! We’re doing our
                photomagnetism lab today, so find
                your partner and break out into
                fours.

     Juno looks up and meets eyes with her longtime lab partner:
     Bleeker. Sound the gong of awkwardness!

     Juno and Bleeker head separately over to an available lab
     station and unpack their bags in silence.

                          JUNO
                Well! Nothing like experimenting.

                          BLEEKER
                I did the prep questions for this
                lab last night. You can copy my
                answers if you need to.

     He slides a piece of graph paper in front of Juno without
     looking at her.

                          JUNO
                Oh, I couldn’t copy your work.

                          BLEEKER
                But you copy my work every week.

                          JUNO
                Oh yeah. I’m kind of a deadbeat lab
                partner, huh?

                          BLEEKER
                I don’t mind. You definitely bring
                something to the table.

                            JUNO
                Charisma?

                          BLEEKER
                Or something.

     The other two LAB PARTNERS, a humorless couple, join them at
     the station.

               I have a menstrual migraine, and I
               can’t look at bright lights today.

               Amanda, I told you to go to the
               infirmary and lie down. You never
               listen.

                         GIRL LAB PARTNER
               No Josh, I don’t take orders. Not
               from you and not from any man.

                         GUY LAB PARTNER
               You know, you’ve been acting like
               this ever since I went up to see my
               brother at Mankato. I told you,
               nothing happened!

                         GIRL LAB PARTNER
               Something happened. Because your
               eyes? Are very cold? They’re very
               cold, Josh. They’re cold, lying eyes.

                         GUY LAB PARTNER
               What? My eyes are not lying!

                         GIRL LAB PARTNER
               Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato,
               they have been lying eyes.

     Juno and Bleeker observe the argument like tennis spectators,
     fascinated by the dynamics of a real couple.

               Okay...I’m going to set up the

     Juno examines a large ad in the newspaper that depicts a
     distraught TEEN GIRL clutching her head in a moment of staged
     conflict. The ad reads: “Pregnant? Find the clinic that gives
     women choice. Women’s Choice Health Center.”

     Juno picks up her hamburger phone and dials. For a moment,
     she attempts to copy the melodramatic pose from the ad,
     checking herself out in the mirror.

                kind of awkward to talk on. It’s

               So Juno, how did your maneuver go
               last night?

                         JUNO
               Which maneuver, sir? The one in which
               I moved an entire living room set
               from one lawn to another, or the one
               in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce
               blue slushie in ten minutes?

     Bren speaks in her strong city accent.

               Juno? Did you happen to barf in my
               urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by
               the front door, the one I got up in
               Stillwater? I found some weird blue
               shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there
               this morning.

                         JUNO
               I would never barf in your urn,
               Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.

     Juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic. There
     is a lone ABORTION PROTESTER, a teenager of Asian descent
     holding a hugely oversized sign that reads “NO BABIES LIKE

               Uh, hi Su-Chin.

                         SU-CHIN
               Oh, hi Juno. How are you?

                         JUNO
               Good. I’m good.
                   (pause)
               Did you finish that paper for
               Worth’s class yet?

                         SU-CHIN
               No, not yet. I tried to work on it
               a little last night, but I’m having
               trouble concentrating.

                         JUNO
               You should try Adderall.

                         SU-CHIN
               No thanks. I’m off pills.

                         JUNO
               Wise move. I know this girl who had a
               huge crazy freakout because she took
               too many behavioral meds at once. She
               took off her clothes and jumped into
               the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and
               she was like, “Blaaaaah! I’m a kraken
               from the sea!”

                         SU-CHIN
               I heard that was you.

                         JUNO
               Well, it was nice seeing you.

     She continues on toward the clinic entrance.

     Juno stops in her tracks but doesn’t bother to turn around.

                         JUNO
               Really? Fingernails?

     She considers the concept, then pushes open the clinic door.


42   INT. WOMEN’S CHOICE CLINIC - RECEPTION - DAY              42

     The receptionist sits behind a pane of bulletproof glass. The
     waiting room is semi-crowded, occupied mostly by pregnant
     women, teens and ill-behaved children.

                         PUNK RECEPTIONIST
               Welcome to Women’s Choice, where
               women are trusted friends. Please
               put your hands where I can see them
               and surrender any bombs.

     Juno flashes her best jazz hands.

                         JUNO
               Hi. I’m here for the big show?

                         PUNK RECEPTIONIST

                         JUNO
               Juno MacGuff.

     The receptionist raises a pierced eyebrow and arranges some
     paperwork on a clipboard.

                         JUNO V.O.
               She thinks I’m using a fake name.
               Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.

     The receptionist hands Juno the clipboard and a pen.

                         PUNK RECEPTIONIST
               I need you to fill these out, both
               sides. And don’t skip the hairy
               details. We need to know about
               every score and every sore.

     The receptionist reaches into one of those ubiquitous women’s
     clinic CONDOM JARS, and holds up a fistful of purple rubbers.

               Would you like some free condoms?
               They’re boysenberry.

                         JUNO
               No thank you. I’m off sex.

                         PUNK RECEPTIONIST
               My partner uses these every time we
               have intercourse. They make his
               balls smell like pie.

                           JUNO
               Congrats.

     She takes a seat in the WAITING ROOM and rifles through a
     pile of old magazines. The magazine selection is lots of
     “mommy mags” and health related periodicals. She selects an
     issue of Family Digest and gingerly flips through for a few
     moments.

     Then she looks over and notices the FINGERNAILS of a nearby
     teen, who looks as nervous as she does. The girl bites her
     thumbnail and spits it onto the floor.

     Juno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting
     woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails.

     Suddenly, she sees fingernails EVERYWHERE. The receptionist
     clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on
     her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their
     fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken...

                                                       CUT TO:

                         PUNK RECEPTIONIST
               Excuse me, Miss MacGoof?

     There’s no answer. We see that Juno’s chair is EMPTY.

     The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door
     drift shut. Juno’s figure recedes into the distance as she
     tears off down the street, running as fast as she can.

               up at four.

                         JUNO
               I couldn’t do it, Leah! It smelled
               like a dentist in there. They had
               these really horrible magazines,
               with, like, spritz cookie recipes and
               bad fiction and water stains, like
               someone read them in the tub. And the
               receptionist tried to give me these
               weird condoms that looked like grape
               suckers, and she told me about her
               boyfriend’s pie balls, and Su-Chin
               Kuah was there, and she told me the
               baby had fingernails. Fingernails!

                         LEAH
               Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the
               baby’s claws could scratch your vag
               on the way out?

                         JUNO
               I’m staying pregnant, Le.

               Keep your voice down dude, my mom’s

               know we’re sexually active.

                         JUNO
               What does that even mean? Anyway, I
               got to thinking on the way over. I
               was thinking maybe I could give the
               baby to somebody who actually likes
               that kind of thing. You know, like
               a woman with a bum ovary or
               something. Or some nice lesbos.

                         LEAH
               But then you’ll get huge. Your chest
               is going to milktate. And you have to
               tell everyone you’re pregnant.

                         JUNO
               I know. Maybe they’ll canonize me
               for being so selfless.

               Well, maybe you could look at one
               of those adoption ads. I see them
               all the time in the Penny Saver.

                         JUNO
               There are ads? For parents?

               Oh yeah! “Desperately Seeking
               Spawn.” They’re right by the ads
               for like, iguanas and terriers and
               used fitness equipment. It’s
               totally legit.

               Yeah, but it sucks for free.

     They turn the pages in silence for a moment. Their lips and

                         LEAH
               You’re not listening to me.

                         JUNO
               No, I heard you. I just can’t give
               the baby to people who describe
               themselves as “wholesome.” I’m
               looking for something a little
               edgier.

                         LEAH
               What did you have in mind, a family
               of disturbed loners who are into
               gunplay and incest?

                         JUNO
               I was thinking a graphic designer,
               mid-thirties, and his cool Asian
               wife who dresses awesome and plays
               bass. But I’m trying to not be too
               particular.

                         LEAH
               All right, how about this one?
               “Healthy, educated couple seeking
               infant to join our family of five.
               You will be compensated. Help us
               complete the circle of love.”

                         JUNO
               Yeesh, they sound like a cult.
               Besides, they’re greedy bitches.
               They already have three kids!

                         LEAH
               Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.

     She points to the paper and motions for Juno to look. Juno
     scans the ad silently.

     We see the ad. It contains a photo of an attractive couple
     with ambiguous Mona Lisa smiles. It reads “Educated,
     successful couple wishes to...”

                They were Mark and Vanessa Loring,
                and they were beautiful even in
                black and white.


45   EXT.   BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE’S WINDOW - NIGHT               45

     We see Paulie’s bedroom window-- festooned with childish
     curtains-- and the light on inside.


46   INT.   BLEEKER’S HOUSE - PAULIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT            46

     Bleeker lies on his Car-bed in his track uniform, listening
     to the same LP from when he and Juno went all the way.

     He stares between the pages of his embossed Dancing Elk Prep
     yearbook.

     We see the object of his gaze is Juno’s black and white
     YEARBOOK PHOTO. Next to it, we see a sloppy, handwritten
     message from Juno. We hear Juno’s voice reading the message:

                          JUNO V.O.
                Hey Bleeker! Spank off to this with
                motion lotion. Just kidding (kind
                of.) Your best friend, Juno.

     Bleeker picks up the phone. It’s the same HAMBURGER PHONE
     Juno has. He reconsiders and puts it down.

     There’s a knock on the bedroom door.

     BLEEKER’S MOM pokes her dowdy head inside.

                          BLEEKER’S MOM
                Paul? Are you coming downstairs to
                eat?

                          BLEEKER
                I don’t think so.

                          BLEEKER’S MOM
                You ran eight miles today, Puppy.

                          BLEEKER
                I’m not hungry, oddly.

                But it’s breakfast for supper. Your
                favorite, Paulie. I made French
                toast and sausage. Patties, not
                linkies, just like you like it.

     Bleeker places his hand silently on his stomach.

                          BLEEKER’S MOM
                Juno MacGuff called while you were
                out running. She wants to know if
                you’re coming to her little
                coffeehouse performance on Saturday.

                          BLEEKER
                Thanks for the message.

                          BLEEKER’S MOM
                You know how I feel about her.

                          BLEEKER
                You’ve mentioned it about fifty
                times.

                          BLEEKER’S MOM
                I just hope you don’t consider her
                a close friend.

     Bleeker’s mom gives up and closes the door.

     We see that Bleeker is clutching a pair of PANTIES in one
     hand, which he slowly releases as the 45 ends.


47   INT.   MACGUFF HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON              47

     Bren and MAC are seated on the couch. Leah is standing nearby
     for reinforcements. Juno paces nervously, trying to suss out
     how to break the massive news.

                          JUNO
                I have no idea how to spit this
                out.

                          BREN
                Hon, did you get expelled?

                           JUNO
                No. The school would probably
                contact you in the event of my
                expulsion.

               Well, I was just asking. It seemed
               plausible.

                         MAC
               Do you need a large sum of money?
               Legal counsel?

                         JUNO
               No, no, I’m definitely not asking
               for anything. Except maybe mercy.
               Like, it would be really great if
               nobody hit me.

                         MAC
               What have you done, Junebug? Did
               you hit someone with the Previa?

                         LEAH
               Best to just tell them, man. Rip
               off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.

                         JUNO
               I’m pregnant.

     Bren and Mac are predictably speechless.

                            BREN
               Oh, God...

                         JUNO
               But I’m going to give it up for
               adoption. I already found the perfect
               people.

     Leah presents the Penny Saver photos of the Lornings.

                         JUNO (CONT’D)
               They say they’re going to pay my
               medical expenses and everything. I
               promise this will all be resolved
               in thirty-odd weeks, and we can
               pretend it never happened.

               You’re pregnant?

               I’m so sorry, you guys. If it’s any
               consolation, I have heartburn
               that’s like, radiating down to my
               kneecaps and I haven’t gone number
               two since Wednesday. Morning!

               I didn’t even know you were

     Juno cringes upon hearing her most-hated term.

                         MAC
               Who is the kid?

                         JUNO
               The baby? I don’t know anything
               about it yet. I only know it’s got
               fingernails, allegedly.

                         BREN
               Nails? Really?

                         MAC
               No, I mean the father! Who’s the

               Yeah, well, there’s this couple
               who’ve been trying to have a baby for
               five years.

                         LEAH
               We found them in the Penny Saver by
               the exotic birds section.

     Bren looks understandably alarmed. Juno hastily attempts to
     make the situation sound more legitimate.

                         JUNO
               But they have a real lawyer and
               everything. I’m going to meet with
               them next weekend.

                         BREN
               Junebug, that is a tough, tough
               thing to do. Probably tougher than
               you can understand right now.

                         JUNO
               Well, I’m not ready to be a mom.

               First things first, we have to get
               you healthy. You need prenatal

               The term “deliver” is so weird. Can

                know it wasn’t his idea.

      Mac shrugs in agreement.

49   INT. LORING HOUSE - DAY                                     49

     Music plays as we see SPARSE IMAGES OF VANESSA LORING’S HANDS
     preparing the house for Juno’s arrival -

     Sprucing a vase of FLOWERS.

     Straightening a FRAMED PHOTO of the Lorings.

     Dusting off a table with one of those WETNAPS for furniture.

     Lining up a shelf of BOOKS.


50   EXT. LORING NEIGHBORHOOD - PREVIA - DAY                     50

     The Previa cruises slowly into the Loring’s fancy gated
     community. Mac pulls over and parks on the curb.


51   EXT. LORING HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY                       51

     Mark and Vanessa Loring have an impressive, though generic
     McMansion. The entire yard is unlandscaped soil. Mac presses
     the doorbell while Juno chews her nails uncomfortably. Both
     look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them.

     VANESSA opens the door. She’s a pretty, meticulous woman in
     her early thirties. Very Banana Republic.

                          VANESSA
                Hi! I’m Vanessa. You must be Juno
                and Mr. MacGuff. I’m Vanessa.

                          JUNO
                Vanessa, right?

                          MAC
                Hello. Thank you for having me and
                my irresponsible child over to your
                home.

                          VANESSA
                Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.


52   INT.   LORING HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                         52

     Vanessa awkwardly leads them into her home.

                          VANESSA
                Can I take your coats?

                Sure.

     She takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into
     Vanessa’s arms who sets it on a bench.

                          JUNO
                Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by
                the way. Super classy. Not like
                those other people with the fake
                woods in the background. Like I’m
                really going to fall for that, you
                know?

                          VANESSA
                You found us in the Penny Saver?

     MARK LORING appears next to Vanessa. He’s a boyishly
     attractive guy in his mid-thirties.

     He glances sheepishly at Vanessa upon hearing the Penny Saver
     mention, then extends his hand to Mac and Juno.

                          MARK
                Hi. I’m Mark Loring. I’m the husband.


53   INT.   LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                     53

     Mark and Vanessa usher Juno and Mac into the austere,
     spacious living room. A woman in a business suit sits on the
     couch with a briefcase in her lap.

                          MARK
                This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.

                          JUNO
                    (in exaggerated, growling
                     German accent) )
                Geeeerta Rauuuss!

                          GERTA
                    (straight)
                Nice to meet you.

     Mac seizes Mark’s hand and pumps it heartily.

                          MAC
                I’m Mac MacGuff, and this, of
                course, is my daughter Juno.

               No.

               Cool. Well, let’s sit down and get
               to know each other a bit.

                         VANESSA
               I’ll get drinks. What would everyone
               like? I’ve got Pellegrino, Vitamin
               Water...

                         JUNO
               A Maker’s Mark, please. Up.

                         MAC
               She’s joking. Junebug has a
               wonderful sense of humor, which is
               just one of her many genetic gifts.

                         JUNO
               I also have good teeth. No
               cavities. We finally got
               fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.

     She bares them frighteningly to demonstrate.

     Vanessa stares, unflappable.

                         MAC
               We’re fine, thank you.

     Mac and Juno join Mark and Gerta Rauss on the couch.

                         GERTA
               So, Juno. First off, how far along
               are you?

                         JUNO
               I’m a junior.

                         GERTA
               No, I mean in your pregnancy.

                         JUNO
               Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the
               doctor yesterday and they said I
               was twelve weeks.

     Vanessa enters with the refreshments om a tray.

               Oh, that’s marvelous. So you’re
               almost into your second trimester,
               then?

                         JUNO
               Yeah, apparently. I’m having it on May 4.

                         VANESSA
               The tough part’s almost over for you. I
               mean, my girlfriends always tell me the
               first couple months are the hardest.

                         JUNO
               Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I’m
               more worried about the part where I
               have to start wearing jeans with an
               elastic panel in the front.

                         VANESSA
               I think pregnancy is beautiful.

                         JUNO
               Well, you’re lucky it’s not you.

     Vanessa’s looks to the ceiling.

                         MARK
                   (clearing throat)
               So, let’s discuss how we’re gonna
               do this...thing.

                         JUNO
               Well, I just have the baby and give
               it to you, right?

                         GERTA
               Mark and Vanessa are willing to
               negotiate an open adoption.

                         MAC
                   (protective)
               Wait. What does that mean?

                         GERTA
               It means they’d send annual
               updates, photos, let Juno know how
               the baby is doing as he or she
               grows up. Of course, Juno’s legal
               rights would be terminated...

               Whoah. I don’t want to see pictures.
               I don’t need to be notified of
               anything. Can’t we just kick it old
               school? I could just put the baby in
               a basket and send it your way. You
               know, like Moses in the reeds.

                         MARK
               Technically, that would be kickin’
               it Old Testament.

     Mark and Juno lock eyes.

                         JUNO
               Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to
               do it. Quick and dirty, like
               ripping off a Band-Aid.

                         GERTA
               Well, then we agree a traditional
               closed adoption would be best for
               all involved, then?

                         JUNO
               Shit, yeah. Close it up.

     Vanessa is clearly ecstatic.

                         MARK
               Obviously, we’ll compensate you for
               your medical expenses.

                         VANESSA
               Are you looking for any other
               compensation?

                            MAC
               Excuse me?

                         JUNO
               Well, no...I’m not going to sell
               the baby. I just want it to grow up
               with people who are ready to love
               it and be parents. I’m in high
               school, dude. I’m ill-equipped.

                         VANESSA
               You’re doing an amazing and
               selfless thing for us.

               You don’t say.

               Yes. Heating and air conditioning.

                         VANESSA
               Well, I was born to be a mother.
               Some of us are.

                         JUNO
               Mark, are you looking forward to
               being a dad?

     Mark is caught off guard.

                         MARK
               Sure, why not? I mean, every guy
               wants to be a father. Coach soccer,
               help with science projects and...I
               don’t know. Fatherly stuff.

               Well, shall we start looking over
               the paperwork? Gerta has already
               drafted some preliminary documents.

                         JUNO
               Can I use the facilities first?
               Being pregnant makes you pee like
               Seabiscuit.

                         VANESSA
               Sure. The powder room down here is
               being re-tiled, but you can use the
               master bath upstairs. Go up, then

     Juno heads into the foyer and up the stairs. We see a posed
     photo of Mark and Vanessa in the stairwell. Their house is
     beautiful, but frigid. Juno rubs her arms, shivering.


55   INT.   LORING HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY                      55

     The Loring’s bathroom is huge. Juno flushes and goes to the
     double sink to wash her hands. She opens the overhead
     cabinet and sees Vanessa’s toiletries. She spritzes on some
     perfume and examines the more expensive grooming items.
     There’s a crinkled tube of LUBE in the cabinet. Juno picks
     it up, fascinated. She rubs a drop of it between her hands
     and runs it through her hair like pomade.

                Whoops! Yikes, I didn’t expect to

                Sorry. I was just getting

                What? No! Do we come off like

                          JUNO
                Well, you don’t just invite a random
                pregnant teenager into your house and
                leave her unsupervised. I could be a
                total klepto, for all you know.

                          MARK
                I don’t get a klepto vibe from you.
                Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist?
                Wouldn’t rule it out.

                         JUNO
                   (halting)
               Wait a minute. Is that a Les Paul?

     Juno is staring into a room with the door slightly ajar. We
     see GUITARS mounted on the wall, and the edges of posters.

                         MARK
               Oh. That’s, uh, my room. Vanessa lets
               me have a room for all my old stuff.

                         JUNO
               Wow, you get a whole room in your
               own house? She’s got you on a long
               leash there, Mark.

                          MARK
               Shut up.

57   INT.   LORING HOUSE - MARK’S “SPECIAL” ROOM - DAY          57

     The walls are plastered with FRAMED POSTERS of early-90s alt
     rock bands. (Mudhoney, Jane’s Addiction etc.) Mark removes
     his LES PAUL from its moorings and hands it to Juno.

                          JUNO
                It’s beautiful. I’ve always liked
                Gibson better than Fender.

                          MARK
                What do you play?

                          JUNO
                I rock a Harmony.

                            MARK
                      (holding back a chuckle)
                Oh.

                          JUNO
                What? I’m a pawn shop rocker.

                          MARK
                Sorry. I swear I’m not a gear snob.

     Juno turns the guitar over, examining it closely.

                          JUNO
                What is that, Mahogany? What
                happens if you crack the neck?

                          MARK
                Tell me about it. I used to play in
                a really tight band back when I
                lived in Chicago, and one night we
                opened for the Melvins...do you
                know who the Melvins are?

                          JUNO
                    (lying)
                Yeah.

                          MARK
                Well, we were playing with them and I
                busted this guitar onstage. It cost me
                $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.

                          JUNO
                When was this, like ‘96?

58    INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                      58

      Vanessa, Mac and Gerta Rauss are waiting in awkward silence
      for Juno and Mark to return. Mac notices a brand new PILATES
      MACHINE sitting in its packaging in a corner of the room.

                          MAC
                So. What’s that thing?

                          VANESSA
                A Pilates machine?

                          MAC
                What do you make with that?

                          VANESSA
                You don’t make anything. It’s for
                exercising.


58A   INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK’S SPECIAL ROOM - SAME            58A

      Mark and Juno tool around on the guitars unplugged. They play
      little riffs. He teaches her a couple chords.


58B   INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME                    58B

                Little Gazelles off the TV, you know,
                from the guy with the ponytail?

      Vanessa and Gerta have no response.

                          MAC
                That guy just doesn’t look right to me.

      Suddenly, a shriek of AMP FEEDBACK, followed by loud,
      discordant GUITAR STRUMMING can be heard drifting down from
      upstairs. Vanessa’s looks to the ceiling.

                          VANESSA

      Mark has strapped on the Les Paul and is playing and singing.
      “Doll Parts” by Hole.

                          JUNO AND MARK
                    (quietly singing together)

                     connecting)
                Yeah, they really want you... they
                really want you... and I do to.
                    (both blush)

      VANESSA appears in the doorway. Juno immediately puts down
      the guitar. Mark doesn’t notice her immediately.

                          MARK

                Oh, sorry honey...

      Mark clumsily puts down the guitar and stands up.

                          VANESSA
                You guys are playing music?

                          MARK
                Juno just wanted a closer look at
                Kimber here.

                          JUNO
                Your guitar is named Kimber?

                That’s all right. My axe is named
                Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted.
                Franklin was the hot one with the
                polio.

                          VANESSA
                I think Gerta is waiting for us
                downstairs with some important
                stuff for us to go over.

     Mark hangs the guitars back on the wall. He and Juno exit the
     room, chastised. Vanessa looks to Mark in question.

                          VANESSA
                Didn’t mean to interrupt the jam
                sessions.

     Juno and Mac have put their coats on and are in the process
     of leaving. Gerta hands Juno the DOCUMENTS. Vanessa and Mark
     trail behind.

                           GERTA
                So, look those over and give me a
                call at my office if you have any
                questions.

                          VANESSA
                Juno, we’d really appreciate it if
                you could keep us updated on any
                doctor’s appointments, ultrasounds,
                other things of that nature.

                          JUNO
                Oh. Sure. Of course you’d want to
                know how your kid is cooking.

                          VANESSA
                So, then, you really think you’re
                going to go ahead with this?

     Mac STARES at Juno gravely.

                          JUNO
                Yeah. For sure. I like you guys.

     Juno looks at Mark.

     Mark seems visibly embarrassed by Vanessa’s manic demeanor.

               Look, if I could give it to you now,
               I would. But it probably looks like a
               Sea Monkey at this point, so I think
               we should leave it in there for a
               while until it gets cuter, you know?

                         MAC
               I think that’s a great idea.

                         MARK
               That’s great, right? Stellar news.
               Well, you guys drive safe, and we’ll

                         MAC
               All right, take care of yourselves.

     Juno and Mac exit. Mark shuts the door. All is silent in the
     foyer. Mark, Vanessa and Gerta stand motionless. Gerta pumps her
     fist triumphantly, trying to create a mood of celebration.

                I can’t grow a moustache. It never

                          VIJAY
                Me neither. But I’m going to stop
                wearing underpants in order to

                         ULTRASOUND TECH
               Well, there we have it. Would you
               like to know the sex?

                         LEAH
               Aw, please Junebug?

                         JUNO
               No way. No, I definitely don’t want
               to know.

                         ULTRASOUND TECH
               Planning to be surprised when you
               deliver?

                         JUNO
               I want Mark and Vanessa to be
               surprised, and if I know, I won’t
               be able to keep myself from telling
               them and ruining the whole thing.

                          ULTRASOUND TECH
                   (condescending)
               Are Mark and Vanessa your friends
               at school?

                         JUNO
               No, they’re the people who are
               adopting the baby.

                         ULTRASOUND TECH
               Oh. Well, thank goodness for that.

               I just see a lot of teenage mothers
               come through here. It’s obviously a
               poisonous environment for a baby to
               be raised in.

     Juno, Leah and Bren become immediately defensive.

                         JUNO
               How do you know I’m so poisonous?
               Like, what if the adoptive parents
               turn out to be evil molesters?

                         LEAH
               Or stage parents!

                         BREN
               They could be utterly negligent.
               Maybe they’ll do a far shittier job
               of raising a kid than my dumbass
               stepdaughter ever would. Have you

               My five year-old daughter could do

64   INT. JUNO’S BEDROOM - DAY                                   64

     Juno lays in bed checking out the ULTRASOUND PRINT OUT.


65   EXT. LORING NEIGHBORHOOD - PREVIA - AFTERNOON               65

     The Previa drives into the front gate of Mark and Vanessa’s

     Valley.”


66   EXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - AFTERNOON                       66

     Juno rings the doorbell, shifting her weight in the cold.

     MARK answers the door, dressed in a t-shirt and jeans.

                         MARK
               Juno? Wow, I didn’t expect to see
               you here.

                         JUNO
               I’ve got something really cool to
               show you guys. Is Vanessa here?

                         MARK
               No, she’s working late tonight.
               She’s trying to accrue some extra
               time off for when, you know...

     He gestures awkwardly to Juno’s belly.

                Right. I hear they can be kind of a
                time-suck.

                          MARK
                Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?

                          JUNO
                Sure. What is it with you rich
                people and your herb-infused
                juices?

                          MARK

     The STEREO blares in the background.

                          JUNO
                Why aren’t you at work?

                          MARK
                I mostly work from home. I’m a

     As they move into the living room, Juno sits down and motions
     for Mark to join her on the couch.

                         JUNO
               Park it, dude.

     Mark sits down. With great fanfare, Juno retrieves a dark,
     glossy sheet from the envelope. It’s her ULTRASOUND.

                         JUNO
               Behold, good sir! The very first

               I think it kind of looks like my

     that her baby might have a father. He stands up and holds the
     photo up to the light critically.

               Can you tell if it’s a boy or a

               The doctor can tell, but I decided
               not to know. I want it to be a big
               surprise.

               Well, it can really only go two ways.

                         JUNO
               That’s what you think. I drink tons

                         MARK
               I know what junk is.

               Well don’t worry about it. My
               stepmom is forcing me to eat really
               healthy. She won’t even let me

               eat red M&Ms. Hope you’re ready.

     Mark chuckles.

                         MARK
               Wait...do you hear that?

     A new SONG has begun. Mark closes his eyes in ecstasy and
     walks toward the stereo. Juno follows him toward the source
     of the music, looking perplexed by how happy he is.

               I’ve heard the Carpenters before.
               Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not

               This album is all Carpenters covers
               by alt-rock bands. It’s called If I

               rip a copy for you before you
               leave.

               You don’t have to do that.

                         MARK
               It’s the least I can do. What did
               you say your favorite band was?

                         JUNO
               I didn’t. But it’s a three-way tie

     Mark walks over to his music collections and starts pulling
     CD’s. He’s got a Carpenter’s disc, the “No Alternative”

                Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate
                master of horror.

     Mark SWIVELS AROUND slowly on his desk chair, surprised.

                          MARK
                Argento’s good, but Lewis is
                completely dimented. We’re talking
                buckets of goo. Red corn syrup
                everywhere. And fake brains up the

                         MARK
               Here’s to dovetailing interests.

     He raises his mug in a toast and Juno clinks it awkwardly.

                         JUNO
               So, have you and Vanessa thought of
               a name for the baby yet?

                         MARK
               Well, sort of. Vanessa likes
               Madison for a girl.

                         JUNO
                   (aghast)
               Madison? Isn’t that kind of...I
               don’t know, gay?

                         MARK
               God, pretentious much? I guess
               everyone should have a mysterious
               name like Juno, huh?

                         JUNO
               My dad went through this phase
               where he was obsessed with Greek
               and Roman mythology. He named me
               after Zeus’s wife. I mean, Zeus had
               other lays, but I’m pretty sure
               Juno was his only wife. She was
               supposed to be really beautiful but
               really mean. Like Diana Ross.

                         MARK
               That suits you.

                         JUNO
               Uh, thanks.

                         MARK
               You know, not many teenage girls in
               your situation would actually go
               through with this.

                         JUNO
               I weighed my options. But after all
               this, I’m glad I didn’t, you know,
               get rid of it. I want to have it.
               For you guys.

                         MARK
               You’re something else.

     A door suddenly slams upstairs. Vanessa’s home.

                          MARK
                Vanessa. Shit, you better get out
                of here.

                          JUNO
                Why? What the big deal?

                          MARK
                Nothing. She just hates when I sit
                around watching movies and ‘not
                contributing.’

                          JUNO
                I’ll handle this. I’m really good
                at diffusing mom-type rage.

     Juno jumps up and rushes out.

                          MARK
                Wait...aww, crap!


70   INT.   LORING HOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON                    70

     Vanessa slides her BRIEFCASE off her shoulder and ventures
     into the living room. She’s struggling to carry some
     oversized shopping bags.

                          VANESSA
                Mark? Are you home? I want to show
                you some things I picked up.

     Juno intercepts her breathlessly, clutching the ULTRASOUND
     photo. Mark trails behind her.

                          JUNO
                Hi Vanessa!

     Vanessa JUMPS and makes a strangled sound.

                          VANESSA
                Juno! God, you startled me. What
                are you doing here? What’s wrong?

                             JUNO
                Nothing...

                          VANESSA
                Then what’s going on?

                         JUNO
               I went to the doctor today.

     Vanessa is obviously entertaining some worse-case scenarios.
     Her eyes are wide and she’s uncharacteristically ruffled.

                         VANESSA
               Is the baby okay?

                         JUNO
               Sure. It’s the right size and
               everything. I even saw its
               phalanges today! Check this...

     She holds the ULTRASOUND up to show Vanessa and drapes her
     arm around her.

                         VANESSA
               What...

                         JUNO
               This is the baby. Your baby.

     Vanessa drops the shopping bags, sick with relief.

                         VANESSA
               Oh my God...

                         JUNO
                   (kindly)
               Doesn’t it look like it’s waving?
               It’s kind of like it’s saying “Hi,
               Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?”

                         VANESSA
               Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.

                          MARK
               Juno was nice enough to bring this
               by for us.

                         JUNO
               I came over as soon as I got that
               cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis.
               My stepmom verbally abused the
               ultrasound tech so we were escorted
               off the premises.

                         VANESSA
                   (distracted)
               Oh, that’s great!

     She can’t divert her gaze from the photo.

      emotion.


70A   INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY WAY - DAY                      70A

      Vanessa and Mark walk Juno out. Juno peers at some shopping
      bags from various kids stores.

                          JUNO
                Hey, what kind of swag did you
                score?

                           MARK
                Yeah.   Mall madness, huh?

                          VANESSA
                Oh it’s just some stuff I picked
                up. For, you know, the baby.

                          VANESSA
                Babies need a lot of things. I want
                everything to be just right.

                          JUNO
                I thought people got all that stuff
                at baby showers. When my stepmom had
                my sister I remember she got about a
                million presents. They were all lame
                though, so I wasn’t jealous.

                          MARK
                I doubt anyone’s throwing us a shower.

                           JUNO
                Why?

                          VANESSA
                Um, I think people are kind of
                unsure about the situation because
                it’s not, you know, set in stone.

                          JUNO
                What do you mean? You
                mean...(aghast) Do you think I’m
                going to flake out on you?

                 No, no, I don’t think that, Juno.
                 It’s just that, we went through a
                 situation before where it didn’t
                 work out.

      Juno glances at Mark and again at Vanessa. Vanessa looks
      embarrassed.

                 Cold feet.

                           JUNO
                 You should have gone to China. I heard
                 they give away babies like free iPods.
                 They shoot ‘em out of those T-shirt
                 guns at sports events.

                           VANESSA
                     (abruptly)
                 Right. Well, Juno, your parents
                 must be wondering where you are.
                 You might want to head home.

                           JUNO
                 Naah. I’m already pregnant, so they
                 figure nothing worse could happen
                 to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It
                 was nice seeing you guys again.

      She waves and heads for the door.

                     (to Juno)
                 Hey, don’t forget your bag.

      Vanessa looks pain-stricken as Mark helps Juno with her bag.

                    JUNO
          I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark
          and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I
          wound up staying for a couple of
          hours.

                    BREN
          A couple of hours? Why are you
          going up there in the first place?

                    JUNO
          They said they wanted to know about
          this stuff. They said to keep them
          updated, so I did!

                    BREN
          You could have sent it to them. Why
          would you drive an hour out to East
          Jesus, Nowhere?

                    JUNO
          I don’t know, I just did. And while
          we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark
          and I watched The Wizard of Gore
          and he burned me some CDs of weird
          music. He’s kind of cool.

A beat as Bren absorbs this.

                    BREN
          That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a
          married stranger. You overstepped a
          boundary.

                    JUNO
          Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you’re
          the one overstepping boundaries.
          You’re acting like you’re the one
          who has to go through this and get
          huge and push a baby out of your
          vag for someone else. Besides, who
          cares if he’s married? I can have
          friends who are married.

                    BREN
          It doesn’t work that way, kiddo.
          You don’t know squat about the
          dynamics of marriage.

               Yeah, because you’re allergic to
               their saliva. I’ve made a lot of

               couple years you’re going to move

     Bren STORMS out. Juno heads to the URN by the door and
     defiantly pours the remains of her blue slushie into it.


71   EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - NIGHT                                   71

     Juno parks her PREVIA on the street. She walks up to the
     house and rings the doorbell.

     BLEEKER’S MOM answers, visibly annoyed. Her eyes drift down
     to Juno’s middle.

                         JUNO V.O.
               Bleeker’s mom was possibly attractive
               once. But now she looks a hobbit. The
               fat one that was in The Goonies.

                         BLEEKER’S MOM
               Hi Juno. What can I do for you?

                         JUNO
               I borrowed Paulie’s physics notes
               in school today. I’m pretty sure he
               needs them back, or his grade could
               plummet to an A minus.

                         BLEEKER’S MOM
               Fine. Come in.

72   INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                         72

     Bleeker’s mom escorts Juno wordlessly up the stairs and down
     the hallway to Paulie’s bedroom. Juno discreetly tries to
     charge ahead of her, but her expanding middle prevents her
     from getting past Bleeker’s mom. They share an extremely
     awkward moment wedged side-by-side in the narrow hallway.

     Bleecker’s mom nudges past Juno and knocks on Bleeker’s
     bedroom door. The door has a cheesy racecar-themed decoration
     hanging on it that says PAULIE’S VRROOOM! It looks like
     something a 5-year old might have.


73   INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT                73

     Paulie is on the floor surrounded by old quizzes, studying
     like the tortured brainiac he is. Mrs. Bleeker opens the
     bedroom door. Juno appears. Paulie jumps, startled.

                         JUNO
               Hey, don’t concentrate so hard,
               man. I think I smell hair burning.

     Bleeker smiles faintly.

                         BLEEKER’S MOM
               Ten minutes.

     She closes the door halfway and leaves. Juno rolls her eyes
     and pulls the door shut entirely.

                            BLEEKER
               What’s up?

                         JUNO
               I just wanted to come over. You
               know, say hi. I miss hanging out
               with you on school nights.

               I miss it too.

     He nervously cracks open a container of ORANGE TIC-TACS and
     pours them into his mouth.

                         JUNO V.O.
               Orange Tic-Tacs are Bleeker’s one
               and only vice.

                When we made out, the day I got

     CU ON BLEEKER’S MOUTH AS HE KISSES JUNO FOR THE FIRST TIME


75   INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT                75

     Bleeker glances at Juno’s midsection, embarrassed.

                         BLEEKER
               So, it looks like you’re getting
               pregnant-er these days.

                         JUNO
               Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole
               private adoption thing. These
               married people in Saint Cloud are
               going to be the parents.

     Bleeker is visibly relieved.

                         BLEEKER
               Really? What are they like?

                         JUNO
               The guy is super cool! His name is
               Mark and he’s into old horror
               movies and he plays guitar. I
               actually hung out with him today.

                         BLEEKER
               Is that normal?

                         JUNO
               I asked my dad and Bren not to narc
               us out to your folks, so we should
               be safe.

                         BLEEKER
               Oh. That’s a relief.

     Juno walks over to the bed and sits down next to Bleeker.

                         JUNO
               I’m going to really start looking
               like a dork soon. Will you still
               think I’m cute if I’m huge?

               I always think you’re cute. I think

     Juno is caught off guard by his sincerity.

                         JUNO
               Jesus, Bleek.

                         BLEEKER
               Well, I do.

     The song playing ends, and another one begins. It’s “the
     song,” the track that Bleeker and Juno both recognize from
     the infamous night in the basement.

                         BLEEKER
               Hey Junebug, when all this is over
               we should get the band back
               together again.

                         JUNO
               Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new
               drumhead we should be good to go.

                         BLEEKER
               We could get back together too.

                         JUNO
               Were we together?

     Bleeker picks at the carpet, dejected.

                         BLEEKER
               Well, we were once. You know, that time.

                         JUNO
               What about Katrina De Voort? You
               could go out with Katrina De Voort.

                         BLEEKER
               I don’t like Katrina.

                         JUNO
               I totally heard you did.

                         BLEEKER
               I don’t. Katrina smells like soup.
               Her whole house smells of soup.

81   INT.   LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY                       81

     Mark and Vanessa stand silently in the nursery. The walls are
     primed slate gray. A single ANTIQUE ROCKING CHAIR sits in the
     corner. Vanessa beams proudly and holds two paint samples up
     near the wall.

                          VANESSA
                What do you think? Custard or
                Cheesecake?

                          MARK
                They’re yellow.

                          VANESSA
                Well, I wanted to pick something
                gender-neutral for now. Once we get
                the baby, God willing, we can
                create a more decisive palette.

                          MARK
                Why do people think yellow is
                gender-neutral? I don’t know one
                man with a yellow bedroom.

                          VANESSA
                I think I’m leaning toward Custard
                in this light. I don’t know. I
                should paint a small area...

                          MARK
                Or you could just wait a couple
                months. It’s not like the baby’s
                going to storm in here any second
                and demand dessert-colored walls.

                          VANESSA
                What to Expect says that readying the
                baby’s room is an important process
                for women. It’s called “nesting.”

                          MARK
                Nesting, huh? Are you planning to
                build the crib out of twigs and
                saliva?

               You should read the book. I even
               flagged the “daddy chapters” for you.

                         MARK
               I just think it’s too early to
               paint. That’s my opinion.

                         VANESSA
               And I disagree.

     Mark shrugs, resigned.

     Vanessa points to the nursery’s largest wall.

                         VANESSA
               That wall is going to need
               something. Maybe we could put our
               first family picture there.

                         MARK
               Hm.

                         VANESSA
               Can you see it?

     Mark stares at the wall, looking lost.

83   INT. RIDGEDALE MALL - DAY                                 83

     Juno and Leah are walking through the mall, looking bored. Juno
     is wearing one of Mac’s giant hockey jerseys in lieu of actual
     maternity wear. Leah gnaws on a giant cinnamon pretzel.

                         LEAH
               Yum. This pretzel tastes like a
               friggin’ donut!

                         JUNO
               Share the love, Tits!

     She wrestles Leah for the pretzel. Onlookers stare at them,
     appalled, as Leah puts Juno in a half-Nelson.

                         JUNO
                   (to eavesdroppers)

                            LEAH
                  What?

     Juno drags Leah behind a pillar and peers out from behind it.
     They’re watching a group of well-heeled women and their
     children shopping en masse. One of the women is pushing a
     toddler in an ultramodern stroller. And one of the women is
     VANESSA, looking vaguely detached.

                            JUNO
                      (hushed)
                  That’s her. That’s Vanessa Loring.

                            LEAH
                  Of the Penny Saver Lorings?

     Juno nods.

                            LEAH
                  No way! She’s pretty.

                            JUNO
                  You sound shocked or something.

                            LEAH
                  I just thought she’d look really
                  old in real life.

     The women gather near a play area, sip Frapps and loudly
     discuss their outfits for an upcoming party.

                            WOMAN #1
                  And I was like, “No offense,
                  sweetie, but nobody looks good in
                  gauchos.”

                            WOMAN #2
                  Especially not with her build.

                            JUNO
                      (mimicking the women,
                       Peanuts-style)
                  Wah-wah-waaah!

     One of the little girls in the group tugs at Vanessa’s
     sleeve. Vanessa happily follows the little girl over to their
     play area and begins to play energetically with her.

                         LEAH
               She’s gonna steal that kid for her
               collection.

                         JUNO
               Right, seriously.

     They watch Vanessa for a few more moments. The other kids
     wander over toward the play area while their mothers ignore
     them. Vanessa continues to entertain the children.

                            LEAH
               Bo-ring!

     Leah stands up.   Juno lingers for a moment.


84   INT. RIDGEDALE MALL - ELEVATOR BANK - A HALF HOUR LATER     84

     Leah and Juno approach the elevator.

                         JUNO
               I want a huge cookie. And like, a
               lamb kebob. Simultaneously.

                         LEAH
               God, Spermy. Must you always feed?

     The elevator door opens, revealing... Vanessa.

                            VANESSA
               Juno?

     Juno tries her best to look enthused.

                         JUNO
               Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to

               Please excuse Leah. She’s mentally

                         VANESSA
               Oh, okay. So...how are you feeling?

                         JUNO

               physically. I’m good. Look, I have
               a snooze button now!

     She lifts her shirt and presses her popped-out NAVEL.

                         VANESSA
               That’s great.

     Vanessa is admiring the belly, when Juno grimaces.

                         JUNO
               Dude, it’s moshing all over.

     Vanessa looks confused.

                   (explains)
               It’s kicking.

     Vanessa nods in understanding then begins summoning the
     courage for an unusual request.

                         VANESSA
               Um... Juno, can I - Can I touch it?

                         JUNO
               Are you kidding? Everyone at school
               is always grabbing at my belly. I’m
               like a legend. They call me the
               Cautionary Whale.

     She grabs Vanessa’s hand and plants it on her stomach.

                         VANESSA
               I can’t feel anything.

     Vanessa moves her hand, wanting desperately to feel the baby.

                         VANESSA
               It’s not moving for me.

     She says this as though it’s an admission of failure.

                there, even though it sounds all ten
                thousands leagues under the sea.

      Vanessa kneels down next to the swell of Juno’s belly.

85    EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - MORNING                              85

      The streets are covered in muddy, slushy snow. The mud is
      instantly TRAMPLED underfoot by the collective feet of the
      Dancing Elk Track Team on their morning run.


85A   INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - BREN’S DESK - DAY                     85A

      Bren cuts the top three inches off a pair of Juno’s jeans.
      Then, using a sewing machine, begins attaching an elastic
      waistband.


85B   INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY                   85B

      We’re behind that same WAISTBAND, as Juno walks through the
      students. Now, people seem to part the waters for the belly.

85C   INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK’S “SPECIAL ROOM” - DAY             85C

      Mark has the Les Paul on his lap as he stares at the boards
      of an awful commercial.

      CU - THE SCRIPT (storyboards). A kitchen scene with a kid
      eating a new breakfast product called - BRUNCH BOWLZ.

      Annoyed and out of ideas, Mark begins an impromptu song...

                          MARK
                IF YOU’RE TIRED OF BREAKFAST BUT
                NOT HUNGRY FOR LUNCH, MICROWAVE
                YOURSELF A HEALTHY BOWL OF BRUNCH!

      Mark drops his head, dejected. Then, the phone rings.

                          MARK
                    (picks up)

                          JUNO
                So, I’ve been spending a lot of
                time listening to that weird CD you
                made me.

      Mark instantly smiles.

                          MARK
                Oh really? What’s the verdict?

                          JUNO
                I sort of like it. I mean, it’s
                cute.

                          MARK
                Cute?

                          JUNO
                Well, when you’re used to the raw
                power of Iggy and the Stooges,
                everything else sounds kind of
                precious by comparison.

                          MARK
                I imagine you have a collection of
                punk chestnuts to prove your point.

                back to work. Just wanted to say
                hi.

      CU on Juno’s tray sliding along, picking up an odd combo of
      pregnant food.

      Pull up to find Juno and Leah walking their trays to a table.

                          LEAH
                God, you’re getting huge. How many
                months has it been now?

                          JUNO
                Almost eight. You wouldn’t believe
                how weird I look naked.

                          LEAH
                I wish my funbags would get bigger.

                          JUNO
                Trust me, you don’t. I actually
                have to wear a bra now. And I have
                to rub this nasty cocoa butter
                stuff all over myself or my skin
                could get stretched too far and
                explode.

                          LEAH
                Hot!



86A   INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY                 86A

      Juno and Leah are sitting inside an emptied awards case on
      the wall, eating their lunch.

      Juno notices that the other kids in the cafeteria can’t help
      but glance her way. Some look derisive, others are amused.

                          JUNO
                God, why is everyone always staring
                at me?

                          LEAH
                Well, you are kind of...convex.

      She illustrates by making a rounded gesture near her stomach.

                          JUNO
                Wow, someone’s been actually doing
                her geometry homework for once!

                          LEAH
                I don’t have a choice. Keith’s been
                grading me really hard lately.

                          JUNO
                Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers
                as “Keith,” okay? My barf reflex is
                already heightened these days.

                          LEAH
                Keith’s hot.

                          JUNO
                Eww, he’s all beardy!

      We see KEITH the teacher talking to some science kids in the
      background. He has a Wild America beard. He lifts a cup of
      coffee to his lips and slurps lustily.

      Back on Juno and Leah:

                          LEAH
                Did you hear Bleek is going to prom
                with Katrina De Voort?

                          JUNO
                Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn’t
                like Katrina. It must be a pity date.

                          LEAH
                    (shrugging)
                He asked her. I heard they were
                going to Benihana, then the prom,
                then to Vijay’s parents’ cabin.

                Bleeker told me Katrina’s whole

                          LEAH
                Oh, it totally does. I was there
                for her birthday about four years
                ago and it was like Lipton Landing.
                But you know, boys have endured
                worse things for nookie.

                          JUNO
                There’s no way in hell they’re
                having sex or even holding hands.

                          LEAH
                I wouldn’t be so sure about that.
                He did it with you. He’s a man now.

                          JUNO
                Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We’re
                best friends.

                          LEAH
                Are you jealous? I thought you said
                you didn’t care what he did.

                          JUNO
                I’m not jealous, and I don’t care.
                I just know he doesn’t like Katrina
                and I don’t think he should toy
                with her emotions like that. She
                seems so nice and all.

                          LEAH
                Okay Juno, I’m really convinced.

                          JUNO
                Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once
                you’re old enough to go, it’s not
                cool anymore.

                         BLEEKER
               Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted
               to go. A bunch of us from the team
               are going to Benihana, then the
               prom, then Vijay’s parents’ cabin.

     Juno is clearly AFFRONTED.

                   (meekly)
               We’re getting a stretch limo.

               Your mom must be really glad you’re
               not taking me.

               You’re mad. Why are you mad?

                         JUNO
               I’m not mad. I’m in a fucking great
               mood. Despite the fact that I’m
               trapped in a fat suit I can’t take
               off, despite the fact that everyone
               is making fun of me behind my back,
               despite the fact that your little
               girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in
               art class yesterday...

                         BLEEKER
               Katrina’s not my girlfriend! And I
               doubt she was actually giving you
               the stinkeye. She just looks like
               that all the time.

     A GIRL strides past (obviously KATRINA) with a sour look
     aimed squarely at Juno.

                         JUNO
               Whatever. Have fun at the prom with
               Soupy Sales. I’m sure I can think
               of something way more cool to do
               that night.

               get hit by a ten-ton truck full of

     Bleeker takes a deep breath.

               Not this time. You don’t have any
               reason to be mad at me. You broke

               ticked at you, man. I should be
               really cheesed off. I shouldn’t
               want to talk to you anymore.

                         JUNO
               Why? Because I got bored and had
               sex with you one day, and then I
               didn’t, like, marry you?

                         BLEEKER
               Like I’d marry you! You would be the
               meanest wife of all time. And anyway,
               I know you weren’t bored that day
               because there was a lot of stuff on
               TV. The Blair Witch Project was on
               Starz, and you were like, “Oh, I want
               to watch this, but we should make out
               instead. La la la.”

     Juno climbs ungracefully into the van. She starts the engine,
     then pauses to dig through her backpack for something. She
     produces a brush and begins brushing her hair in the rearview
     mirror, examining herself self-consciously. She puts on some
     Dr. Pepper Lip Smacker and backs out of the driveway.


90   INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK’S SPECIAL ROOM - DAY                90

     Mark is seated at the computer, surfing a horror movie
     website. He has the blank expression of a bored obsessive.
     The doorbell rings.


91   INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY                              91

     Mark opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly
     knocked-up. She holds a stack of CDs. Mark breaks into a
     grin.



                         MARK
               Wow. That shirt is working hard.

                         JUNO
                   (furtive)
               Is Vanessa here?

                         MARK
               Nope. We’re safe.

     He and Juno smile conspiratorially.

                         JUNO
               Cool.

                         MARK
               Come on, I have something for you.

     He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house.


92   INT. LORING HOUSE - BASEMENT - AFTERNOON                     92

     The Lorings’ basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and
     unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker’s. Mark pulls a chain
     to illuminate a bare bulb.

               Oh, Mark! Is this the baby’s room?
               It’s beautiful!

                         MARK
               Hilarious. No, I just keep all of
               my old comics down here, and I want
               to show you one of them.

                         JUNO
               Oh God, you’re one of those guys...

                         MARK
               You’re gonna like this, I promise.

     Mark RUMMAGES through a cardboard box in the corner.

                         MARK
                   (extracting a bagged COMIC
                    from the box)
               Here it is.

     He shows the COMIC to Juno. It’s called “Most Fruitful Yuki.” It
     depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking names.

                         JUNO
               “Most Fruitful Yuki”? What is...Oh
               my god, she’s a pregnant superhero!

                         MARK
               Isn’t that great? I got it when I
               was in Japan with my band. She
               reminds me of you.

     Juno examines the comic. “Most Fruitful Yuki” does resemble her.

                         JUNO
               Wow, I actually feel like less of a
               fat dork now.

                          MARK
               Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man.
               You should be proud to be the same
               condition.

     She throws a KARATE KICK in Mark’s direction with a KEE-YA!

     Juno is sincerely pleased.

                         JUNO
               Okay, how about some tunes?

     There’s a battered portable CD player in the corner. Juno
     kneels down and pops in one of the discs.

                         JUNO
               Now this first one is kinda slow.
               But it’s Mott the Hoople so it’s
               still totally rad and hardcore.

     Juno puts in the CD and “All The Young Dudes” fills the room.

     Mark Laughs.

                         JUNO
               What?

                         MARK
               I actually know this one.

                         JUNO
               You do?

                         MARK
               Yeah, this song’s older than me, if
               you can believe that. I danced to
               it at my senior prom.

                         JUNO
               That’s almost interesting, Mark.
               Who did you dance with?

                         MARK
               Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she
               was a good dance partner. Even let
               me put my hands on her butt.

                         JUNO
               Oh man, I can just picture you slow
               dancing like a dork!

     She mockingly places her hands on Mark’s waist and moves back
     and forth stiffly.

                         MARK
               No, I put my hands on your waist.
               Then you put your arms around my
               neck. That’s how we did it in ‘88.

     Mark puts his hands on what remains of Juno’s waist. She
     drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously.

                         JUNO
               Oh, okay. Like this.

                         JUNO
                   (casually defensive)
               Only squares and nerds go to dances.

                         MARK
               What are you?

                         JUNO
               I don’t know.

     They SWAY slowly to the music. Juno’s belly bumps up against
     Mark.

                         MARK
               I feel like there’s something
               between us.

     They laugh.

     Juno rests her head on Mark’s chest. They dance in silence
     for a few moments, then stop moving. Mark pulls Juno as close
     as he possibly can, given her expanding girth.

                         MARK
               I’m leaving Vanessa.

                         JUNO
                   (quiet at first)
               What?

               It’s just not working out, but I’m

               and I’ve got it all planned out.
               It’s something I’ve wanted to do

     Juno backs away.

                     (growing)

               No. No, you definitely cannot do

               of no!

     She GESTURES wildly to her belly. Suddenly, something matters
     to her far more than the approval of an older guy.

                         MARK
               But I thought you’d be cool if...

               That’s not the point. We’re just

               Yeah, but didn’t you love Vanessa

               someone once, you can love them
               again, I know it. My friend Leah has
               gone out with the same guy, like,
               four times. You’re just not trying.

     Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is - a teenage girl.

                         MARK
               I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe

               Not really. I’m sixteen. I’m old
               enough to tell when people are
               acting like total a-holes!

     Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at
     Mark.

                         JUNO
               Oh and by the way, I bought another
               Sonic Youth album and it’s the

93   INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                       93

     Juno reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the
     front door, only to be intercepted by Vanessa, who’s
     returning home from work, carrying her briefcase and a
     freshly purchased NURSING PILLOW. They nearly collide.

                         VANESSA
               Juno? What’s going on?

                          JUNO
               Nothing.

     It’s obvious from Juno’s tears and flushed face that she’s
     lying. Vanessa instantly goes pale with fear, but she tries
     her hardest to seem serene and “together” in front of Juno.

                         VANESSA
                   (pretending to be calm)
               Mark? Why is Juno crying?

                         JUNO
               I’m not crying. I’m allergic to
               fine home furnishings. See you
               later.

     She rushes toward the door.

                          VANESSA
               Hold on.

     Juno halts.

                         VANESSA

                         MARK
               She’s hormonal. Right, June? It’s
               just part of the whole process.

     Juno looks totally betrayed. She doesn’t respond. Vanessa
     looks at Juno’s expression and knows Mark is lying.

                         VANESSA
               What did you do?

                         MARK

               I’ve been just wondering if we’re,
               you know, ready.

                         VANESSA
               Of course we’re ready. We’ve taken

                   (to Juno)
               Juno, don’t worry about this. He just
               has cold feet. That’s how boys are.
               The books all say the same thing. A
               woman becomes a mother when she gets
               pregnant. A man becomes a father when
               he sees his baby. He’s going to get
               there. He’ll get there.

     Juno ain’t buying it.

               Why don’t we let Juno go home and we

               It all just happened so fast. We
               put that ad in the paper. I thought

               later, she’s in our living room.

                         VANESSA
                   (quietly)
               She answered our prayers.

                         MARK
                   (ignores the comment)
               Ever since, it’s just been like a
               ticking clock.

     This stops Vanessa. Juno looks offended.

                         VANESSA
               What are you saying?

     A long hideous beat.

                         MARK
               It just feels a little like bad
               timing.

     Another hideous beat.

                         VANESSA
               What would be a good time for you?

                         MARK
               I don’t know. There’s just things I
               still want to do.

                         VANESSA
               Like what? Be a rock star?

                         MARK
               Don’t mock me.

     Vanessa sighs. It’s done.

                         VANESSA
               You’re trying to do something that’s
               never going to happen. And you know
               what? Your shirt is stupid. Grow up.
               If I have to wait for you to become
               Kurt Cobain, I’m never going to be a
               mother.

     Vanessa looks defeated.

                         MARK (CONT’D)
               I never said I’d be a great father.

     We hear the front door closing. Vanessa and Mark look over
     and notice that Juno has escaped the conflict.

94    EXT. LORING HOUSE - AFTERNOON                               94

      Juno runs up to her car sobbing. She struggles with the keys,
      but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off.


      EXT. HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON

      The Previa slides off the road and comes to a stop on the
      shoulder.


      INT. PREVIA - AFTERNOON

      Juno buckles over the steering wheel, crying, unwinding for
      the first time since she became pregnant.

      After a beat, she begins to gather herself.


      INT. BLEEKER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Bleeker is sitting next to his bed, noodling on the guitar.
      He’s playing a theme that we will soon recognise.


      EXT. CORNER STORE - NIGHT

      Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her
      future. We push in close... when she gets an idea.

      She hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she
      finds a crumpled up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and
      pulls out a pen, ready to write something... a note?


      EXT. LORING HOUSE - NIGHT

      It’s quiet after the storm. Inside, we see Vanessa sitting
      alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of
      wine.


103   INT.   LORING HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT                   103

      Vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events sink
      in. After a beat, Mark comes down the stairs to join her.

                           MARK
                 I called Gerta Rauss. She says she
                 can represent both of us. They call
                 it “collaborative divorce.” It’s
                 apparently all the rage right now.

                 And it’s easy because we don’t have
                 children.

                          VANESSA
                No, it’s fine. Thanks for making
                the call, I guess.

      Mark nods and sits down.

                          VANESSA
                We’re actually, finally doing this?

                          MARK
                Looks like it, yeah.

                          VANESSA
                Have you found a place to stay?

                          MARK
                Yeah, downtown.

                           VANESSA
                A hotel?

                          MARK
                It’s a loft.

                          VANESSA
                    (lightly teasing)
                Aren’t you the cool guy?

      They STARE at the wall, speechless and defeated.

                          VANESSA
                I wanted a baby so bad. So bad.

      She buries her head in her hands.

                          MARK
                I know you did.

      There’s a LOUD KNOCK on the front door.


      EXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT

      Mark opens the door. There’s a folded piece of paper sitting
      on the doormat. He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the
      van.

      Mark carefully unfolds the piece of paper--it takes a minute
      because of Juno’s proficiency in “teen girl origami.” He
      holds it up. We can see there’s WRITING on the back.

                It looks like a bill from Jiffy-
                Lube.

     Vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over,
     examining it.

                          VANESSA
                It’s for me.


95   EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - NIGHT                                  95

     Juno parks her car and walks up to her house. A porch light’s
     been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting.

                          JUNO V.O.
                I never realize how much I like being
                home unless I’ve been somewhere
                really different for a while.

     She picks a CROCUS from the unkempt garden near the porch and
     sniffs it. She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly with it.
     Then she tucks the flower into her unkempt hair.


96   INT.   MACGUFF HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                      96

     Mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family
     finances while drinking one of Bren’s weight loss shakes.

     Juno enters.

                          JUNO
                Hi Dad.

                          MAC
                Hey, big puffy version of Junebug.
                Where have you been?

                          JUNO
                Dealing with stuff way beyond my
                maturity level. Where is everyone?

                          MAC
                Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot
                ice skating class.

                          JUNO
                Tot ice skating? Tots can’t ice
                skate. Liberty Bell’s still getting
                the hang of stairs.

                         MAC
               No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.

                         JUNO
               Yeah, she does.

                         MAC
               You look a little morose, honey.
               What’s eating you?

                         JUNO
               I’m losing my faith in humanity.

                         MAC
               Think you can narrow it down for me.

                         JUNO
               I guess I wonder sometimes if
               people ever stay together for good.

                         MAC
               You mean like couples?

                         JUNO
               Yeah, like people in love.

                         MAC
               Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be
               honest; I don’t much approve of you
               dating in your condition, ‘cause... well,
               that’s kind of messed up.

                          JUNO
               Dad, no!

                         MAC
               Well, it’s kind of skanky. Isn’t
               that what you girls call it?
               Skanky? Skeevy?

                         JUNO
               Please stop now.

                         MAC
                   (persisting)
               Tore up from the floor up?

                         JUNO
               Dad, it’s not about that. I just need
               to know that it’s possible for two
               people to stay happy together
               forever. Or at least for a few years.

                          MAC
                It’s not easy, that’s for sure.
                Now, I may not have the best track
                record in the world, but I have
                been with your stepmother for ten
                years now, and I’m proud to say
                that we’re very happy.

     Juno nods in agreement.

                          MAC (CONT’D)
                In my opinion, the best thing you
                can do is to find a person who
                loves you for exactly what you are.
                Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty,
                handsome, what have you, the right
                person will still think that the
                sun shines out your ass. That’s the
                kind of person that’s worth
                sticking with.

     A wave of REALIZATION crosses Juno’s face.

                          JUNO
                I sort of already have.

                          MAC
                Well, of course. Your old D-A-D!
                You know I’ll always be there to
                love and support you, no matter
                what kind of pickle you’re in.

     He nods toward her belly.

                             MAC
                Obviously.

     Juno laughs and hugs her father, planting a smooch on his
     cheek.

                          JUNO
                I need to go out somewhere for just
                a little while. I don’t have any
                homework, and I swear I’ll be back
                by ten.

     She salutes and dashes out of the kitchen.

                          MAC
                You were talking about me, right?

100    INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - BLEEKER’S ROOM - NIGHT                100

       We push in over Bleeker sleeping in his car-bed towards the
       window. We look out onto the lawn to find Juno and Leah
       running back to the Previa, hopping in, and screeching off.

101    EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MORNING                               101

       Bleeker steps out of the house for his usual early-morning run.

       He looks down to see a message scrawled in chalk on the
       stoop: “BLEEKER- CHECK THE MAIL.”

       He walks down to the end of the driveway and opens the latch
       on the mailbox.

       At least one hundred containers of ORANGE TIC TACS come pouring
       out in an colorful deluge. They spill out onto the driveway.

       Bleeker smiles.


102    EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - MORNING                  102

       Juno waddles toward the field. The guys on the track team,
       ridiculously arrayed as usual, are doing hurdler stretches.
       They stare at her quizzically. Bleeker spots Juno approaching
       and jogs up to the chainlink fence.

                Did you put like a hundred things
                of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?

                          JUNO
                Yeah. That was me.

                          BLEEKER
                Why?

                          JUNO
                    (blushes)
                Because they’re your fave. And you
                can never have too much of your
                favorite one-calorie breath mint.

                           BLEEKER
                Well...thanks. I think I’m pretty
                much set until college on the Tic
                Tac front.

                          JUNO
                You know, I’ve been thinking. I’m
                really sorry I was such a huge
                bitch to you. You didn’t deserve
                that. You never deserve any of the
                poo I unload on you.

                          BLEEKER
                You know it’s okay.

                          JUNO
                Also, I think I’m in love with you.

                          BLEEKER
                What, you mean as friends?

                          JUNO
                No, for real. I think you are the
                coolest person I’ve ever met. And
                you don’t even have to try.

                          BLEEKER
                I try really hard, actually...

                          JUNO
                No, you’re naturally smart. You
                always think of the funniest things
                to do. Remember when you passed me
                that postcard during Spanish class,
                and it was addressed like, “Junebug
                MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the

                And it said, “I’m having fun in
                Barcelona- wish you were here”?
                That was hilarious.

                          BLEEKER
                I was just bored. I only think school
                is awesome like, 80% of the time.

                          JUNO
                Plus, you’re the only person who
                doesn’t stare at my stomach all the
                fucking time. You actually look at my
                face. And every time I look at you,
                the baby starts kicking me super hard.

                            BLEEKER
                It does?

      Juno presses Bleeker’s hand against her belly.

                            BLEEKER
                Wizard!

                          JUNO
                I think it’s because my heart
                starts pounding when I see you.

                            BLEEKER
                Mine too.

                          JUNO
                Basically, I’m completely smitten
                with you, and I don’t care if I’m
                making an ass out of myself right
                now, because you’ve seen me make an
                ass out of myself a million times,
                and you still want to be my friend.

                          BLEEKER
                Well, yeah. You’re the best friend
                I’ve ever had, even when you’re
                being kind of evil.

                          JUNO
                That’s all I need from you. That’s
                more than I could ever ask for.
                You’re just golden, dude.

                          BLEEKER
                Can we make out now?

                            JUNO
                Okay.

       Bleeker and Juno KISS, oblivious to the gawking track team
       guys in the background.

       In the distance, near the school entrance, we see STEVE
       RENDAZO (the kid who always TORMENTS Juno) regarding the
       makeout session with a sad, envious expression.

       LEAH passes by, does a double take, then hurries up to the
       fence, rolling her eyes.

                           LEAH
                     (disgusted)
                 You know, you can go into early
                 labor sucking face like that!

       Juno gives her the FINGER, not breaking the clinch with Bleeker.



105    INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO’S BEDROOM - MORNING               105

       Juno is lying on her back on the bed, staring at the ceiling.
       She’s more pregnant than we’ve ever seen her. She revs a
       Matchbox car against the slope of her belly and lets it roll.

       Juno suddenly sits up, looking thoroughly freaked. She pats
       her lap frantically and jumps off the bed.

                           JUNO
                 Dad!

      Mac, Bren and Liberty Bell rush out of the house. They pile
      into the Previa at breakneck speed. Juno waddles behind them,
      protesting.

      CU of Juno wearing a puffy surgical cap. She’s being pushed
      down the hospital corridor in a wheelchair. She bursts into
      giggles. Pull back to reveal her that Leah is pushing her
      rather aggressively. Leah jokingly steers the wheelchair into
      a wall. Juno feigns whiplash.

      Bren appears behind them and orders Juno out of the
      wheelchair, exasperated. She pulls off Juno’s surgical cap.
      Leah and Juno snicker.


108   INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY                     108

      We see Juno is in a BIRTHING SUITE at the hospital, pacing
      impatiently, bent over in obvious discomfort. She’s wearing
      her Chuck Taylors and knee socks with her hospital gown. Leah
      and Bren stand nearby.

      Juno doubles over in pain.

                          JUNO
                    (panicked)
                Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I
                get that Spinal Tap thing?

                          BREN
                It’s called a spinal block, and you
                can’t have it yet, honey. The doctor
                said you’re not dilated enough.

                          JUNO
                You mean I have to wait for it to
                get even worse? Why can’t they just
                give it to me now?

                          BREN
                Well, honey, doctors are sadists
                who like to play God and watch
                lesser people scream.

      Juno lets out a genuine shriek of pain.

                It really didn’t hurt that bad
                having him.

      We see Juno in the process of delivery, from her POV. Leah
      holds one of Juno’s feet and Bren holds the other.

                          JUNO V.O.
                The best part was when I peed on
                Leah during labor.

      We see Leah holding Juno’s FOOT, which is shaking. Leah’s
      shirt is soaked. She rolls her eyes and mouths “Fuck you” at
      Juno. Juno’s raised MIDDLE FINGER enters the frame.

                          JUNO V.O.
                And then, out of nowhere, there
                it was...

      The doctor reveals JUNO’S BABY BOY above the sheet.

                          JUNO (V.O.)
                There he was.

      Juno looks at the baby in awe, then her eyes begin to
      flutter... and she passes out.

      Paulie Bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him
      on the Dancing Elk track. There’s a very sparse crowd in the
      bleachers. As Paulie approaches the tape, his envious
      teammate Vijay looks on. Bleeker’s mom is seated near Vijay,
      holding a video camera.

                          JUNO V.O.
                I decided to not call Bleeker to
                tell him that I was having the
                baby. He had a big meet against
                Manteno and I didn’t want him to
                get all worried about me and choke.

      people in attendance cheer.

                    (admiringly)
                His legs are as swift as his seed.

                          MRS. BLEEKER
                What did you say?

      Bleeker pants at the finish line, dripping with sweat.

                          ANNOUNCER
                P. Bleeker has just broken a
                district record in the 400.

      Bleeker looks out at the BLEACHERS, scanning them for Juno.
      She’s not there.

                          JUNO V.O.
                But he figured it out anyway.

      Bleek takes off RUNNING toward the parking lot without
      stopping to explain. His mother stands up, confused.


111   INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - DAY                       111

      A NURSE reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and
      gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby.

      The nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator.

                          NURSE
                Would you like to meet your son?

      Pull back to reveal she’s speaking to VANESSA, who stands,
      paralyzed, several feet away.

                          VANESSA
                I have a son?

                time getting out.

      Vanessa reaches out for the baby and gingerly accepts him in
      her eyes. She spends a few moments just looking at him.

      She feels someone watching her, then looks up to see a Bren
      leaning against the doorway.

      Vanessa blinks away her tears self-consciously.

                          VANESSA
                How do I look?

                          BREN
                    (gently)
                Like a mom. Scared shitless.

      Vanessa laughs.


112   INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY                        112

      Juno is curled up on her bed in the birthing room. The birth
      is obviously over; there’s that air of stillness and
      accomplishment, a task completed. The doctors have cleared
      out. Mac sits in a chair next to the bed, looking like he’s
      not sure what to say.

      He holds up a deck of Playing cards as if to initiate a game,
      but Juno gently pushes his hand away. Their eyes meet. His
      expression is helpless, hers is utterly drained.

                          MAC
                Someday, you’ll be back here,
                honey. On your terms.

      Juno nods and swallows.

      Over Mac’s shoulder, a silhouette appears in the doorway.
      It’s Bleeker in his track uniform.

      Juno sees him and bursts into sudden, ragged sobs. Mac
      glances at her, alarmed. Paulie moves toward the bed. Mac
      clears his throat, gets up and leaves the room.

      Paulie climbs onto the hospital bed and carefully puts his
      arm around Juno. She leans into him, letting herself go for
      the first time in months.

113   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BIRTHING SUITE - EVENING            113

      Juno lies on the bed. She looks rested and relaxed compared
      to her earlier crying jag, but her face is still pink and
      swollen. Bleeker is curled up next to her, still in his track
      uniform and spikes.

                          JUNO V.O.
                Bleeker decided he didn’t want to
                see the baby. Neither did I,
                really. He didn’t feel like ours.


114   INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - EVENING                 114

      We see Vanessa leaning over the bassinet, unable to take her
      eyes off the baby, touching it’s hair reverently.

                          JUNO V.O.
                I think he was always hers.

      The nursery is perfectly decorated in Vanessa’s immaculate
      taste. Nothing looks as though it’s been touched. We see the
      antique ROCKING CHAIR sitting empty.

                          JUNO V.O.
                It ended with a chair.

      We pan past the wall Vanessa had said “needed something.”
      There’s a framed note on the wall. It looks like it was
      handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. We see that it
      says: “Vanessa - If you’re still in, I’m still in. Juno.”

      We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa’s bedroom. We
      see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her
      shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa
      looks disorganized, unshowered--and incredibly happy. There
      are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet
      pushed close to the bed. Obviously, she hasn’t been away from
      the baby for a single moment.

      The baby reaches up and grabs Vanessa’s thumb. Vanessa glows
      with an expression of pure bliss.

      It’s a sparkling summer afternoon. Juno wheels her bicycle
      out of the detached garage. She waves goodbye to Bren, who is
      playing in the yard with two WEIMARANERS. She looks almost as
      happy with her dogs as VANESSA looked with her baby.


120   EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - DAY                                 120

      Juno rides her bike aggressively down the street. Her guitar
      is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. She’s obviously not
      pregnant anymore. She looks happy, but older.

                          JUNO V.O.
                As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is
                totally boss. He is the cheese to
                my macaroni. I know people are
                supposed to fall in love before
                they reproduce, but normalcy’s not
                really our style.

      As she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she
      passes the Dancing Elk TRACK TEAM, still running in
      outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas.

      Juno RIDES up to a garage where Bleeker is sitting, tuning
      his guitar.


121   EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - DAY                                    121

      Juno bikes up to find Bleeker sitting on the stoop. She
      smiles and takes out her guitar. She sits across from Bleeker
      and pulls the pick out of the strings.

                          JUNO
                Ready?

      Bleeker nods.

      Juno begins strumming her guitar and playing “Anyone Else But
      You,” by the Moldy Peaches. Bleeker joins in. At first their
      playing is discordant, but suddenly it works.

                          BLEEKER
                You’re a part time lover and a full-
                time friend. The monkey on your
                back is the latest trend.

                          JUNO
                Here is the church and here is the
                steeple. We sure are cute for two
                ugly people. I don’t see what anyone
                can see, in anyone else but you.

                          BLEEKER
                We both have shiny happy fits of
                rage. You want more fans, I want
                more stage. I don’t see what anyone
                can see, in anyone else but you.

                          JUNO
                You are always trying to keep it
                real. I’m in love with how you
                feel. I don’t see what anyone can
                see, in anyone else but you.

                          BLEEKER
                I kiss you on the brain in the shadow
                of a train. I kiss you all starry-
                eyed, my body’s swinging from side to
                side. I don’t see what anyone can
                see, in anyone else but you.

                          JUNO
                The pebbles forgive me, the trees
                forgive me. So why can’t you
                forgive me? I don’t see what anyone
                can see, in anyone else but you.

                          JUNO AND BLEEKER TOGETHER
                Du du du du du du dudu. Du du du du
                du du dudu. I don’t see what anyone
                can see, in anyone else but you.

      She and Bleeker exchange glances as they play. They smile
      ambiguously. Juno leans over and kisses Bleeker on the cheek.

      Pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with
      life and summer activity.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK

Knocked Up
  By Judd Apatow




     Page 1/112

Light your nuts on fire.
Fuck! Fuck! My hands!
Too hot for Jonah!
I got fucking water
in my mouth!
Oh, my God!
I got to get off! I got
to get off! Got to get off!
Got to get off!
Sadie, wake up!
Oh, my gosh!
Daddy, wake up!
Okay, I'm up.
Is that my genius over here?
Is that my genius?
I need you to take the kids
to school this morning.
I would, but I'm supposed
to work out.
What?
Yeah. I got an appointment
with a trainer. I can't cancel
it now. He'll charge me.
You didn't tell me that.
Yeah, I did.
Last week I told you.
You didn't tell me.
I did. And then I wrote it
on the calendar
like you told me to.
No, you didn't tell me.
I did tell you.
Well, you didn't,
but what are we gonna do,
'cause I have an appointment?
So you're taking
the kids to school.
Don't use the baby
to cover your tracks.
I can drive them.
I'll drive them to school.
Thank you very much.
Great. Good.
You turned my sister


                                 Page 2/112

into a limo driver.
I don't mind.
It all worked out!
What are you giggling about?
Be quiet.
You're starting to annoy me.
Poo poo.
Ladies. Be nice.
You know what
I did the other day?
What?
I googled ""murder.""
You googled ""murder""?
Yeah.
Why?
I mean, what did it say?
It didn't say anything.
It just showed pictures
of people lying dead
on the floor and blood
everywhere, and...
That was just ketchup.
Who wants to hear some music?
I want to hear Rent.
I want to hear Green Day!
No, we're listening to Rent!
Well, I want to listen
to Green Day.
I got your baby!
Don't taunt her. Come on.
Here.
Sadie! Why did you just
do that? Don't throw
things at your sister!
She hit me.
Did you hit her?
I did not.
Make her happy. It's okay.
It won't make her happy.
It's okay. It's okay.
She spilled all the
marbles on the floor.
Well, give her
her marble back.


                                Page 3/112

All right? Are you sure
you understand
the terms of the bet?
Because this is serious.
No.
Martin, all right, listen.
You don't shave your beard
or cut your hair for one year,
and if you can do that,
I will pay your rent.
But if you shave,
then you have to pay
all five of our rents.
Thanks for
the free money, bitch.
Hey, Martin, was it weird
when you joined the Taliban,
being American
and everything like that?
Like when you see
a woman driving a car,
do you just get pissed?
Just watch your back, Serpico.
You never know
who your friends are.
Okay, all right. You guys
can't make fun of me
the whole time.
But, Martin, it's a competition.
It's called the Dirty Man Competition.
We're gonna make fun of you
until you shave the beard.
That's the rules.
That's the whole point.
You're supposed to be
tempted into shaving.
Your face looks
like Robin Williams' knuckles.
You guys aren't allowed
to make fun of me.
It's not part of the rules.
Martin, why didn't you
just listen to me when
I was explaining the rules?


                                 Page 4/112

You just looked
at me with that
blank stare of yours.
It was like talking
to a wax statue.
Okay, guys, are you ready?
So, ""Only at
fleshofthestars.com will
customers be able to find
""exactly how long
into what movies their
favorite stars are exposed.""
Nice.
Oh, fucking brilliant.
Pretty good, right?
Yeah. Yeah, ka-ching.
We're in.
All right, guys,
let start logging, all right?
Charles Manson?
Do you have
any other thoughts?
Good, awesome,
let's start this off
with a bang.
Jamie Lee Curtis. I got
an hour and 10 minutes
into Trading Places.
Both chesticles.
I got Julianne
""Red Beard"" Moore.
Short Cuts, two hours,
Julianne Moore special.
She loves it.
I've seen that,
and from the look of her bush,
Short Cuts is the wrong
name for that movie.
Nice.
Nice. Nice. Well done.
Her bush looks like
the hedge maze
from The Shining but red
and without


                                 Page 5/112

Scatman Crothers in it.
Red Bush.
Red Bush.
So if you want that
perfect tan like the stars,
he's the one to see.
We'll be right back
on E! News. Stay with us.
Okay.
Okay, is Jessica Simpson
here yet?
Let me check. Let me see.
Is she on her way?
She's left her house?
Hey, guys?
Okay, let me know
when she's pulling in.
She's about to pull in.
Is she camera-ready?
Is she camera-ready?
If she's gonna be in hair
and makeup for three hours,
I can't do it.
I'm not gonna be here.
I got to do American Idol.
It's live. I got to do it.
I got to be there.
What are we gonna
interview her about?
Nothing personal.
No personal questions.
No personal questions.
Don't ask her about her sister
and her nose job.
No plastic surgery questions.
No plastic...
No personal questions.
She doesn't want to talk about
her boobs or her father's
comments about her boobs.
Great. We'll talk about
the Middle East and maybe
an idea of an exit strategy.
Maybe she has a good pitch.


                                 Page 6/112

Should I ask her about Korea?
Maybe have her point it
out to us on a globe?
I don't understand
the young talent in this town!
It doesn't make any sense.
I got four jobs.
Hell, I'm more famous
than half the people
we talk to, anyway!
No one stands up.
No one has the balls
to sit them down
and say,
""Look, just cut the shit.""
But everybody works for them.
They're all on the payroll.
They're all sucking the teat!
Nobody sits them down,
eye-to-eye, one-on-one,
and says, ""Cut the shit.""
And all these stars
just fuck it up.
That's what they do.
They fuck my day up!
And it pisses me off.
And now I'm sweating.
Okay, you want to...
You know what?
You want us to just come
and get you
when she gets here?
You want to head to
the green room for a minute?
Just chill out? Okay.
Yeah. That's a good idea.
Want us to bring you anything?
You want some water?
You want a cookie?
Cookie, yeah, cookie. Thanks.
Okay, we'll get you a cookie.
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm pissed.
What do we got?
Chocolate chip?


                                 Page 7/112

Allison?
Yeah.
Jack and I need
to see you in his office.
Okay.
Thanks for coming in, Allison.
Well, we wanted
to talk to you today
because we had a little debate
on the conference call
with New York about you.
You... About me?
You were talking about me?
We were wondering
aloud to one another
whether or not you would
be good for on camera.
What'd you decide?
They... They decided
that they like you,
and they would like
to put you on camera.
Really?
I know.
I was so surprised, too.
Oh, my God.
This is the best news ever.
Thank you so much.
This is great!
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I'll take that smile
as a ""Yes, I'll do it.""
Absolutely. I'm so excited!
Oh, my God.
It's a lot of work. Can't wait
to see what happens.
It's gonna be tough.
Tough job.
About the work,
most immediately,
there's gonna be
some things that you're
gonna be able to get...


                                 Page 8/112

Okay.
...that other people
in the office don't get.
One of them, gym membership.
You want me to lose weight?
No, I don't
want you to lose weight.
No. We can't legally
ask you to do that.
We didn't say lose weight.
I might say tighten.
Tight.
A little tighter?
Just like toned and smaller.
Don't make everything smaller.
I don't want to
generalize that way.
Tighter.
We don't want you
to lose weight. We just
want you to be healthy.
Okay.
You know, by eating less.
We would just like it
if you go home
and step on a scale
and write down
how much you weigh
and subtract it by, like, 20.
Twenty.
And then weigh that much.
Just remember,
you've got it here,
you've got it here
and everybody's gonna
see you right there.
Yay! That's so exciting!
Oh, my God!
Hey!
Huh?
I got a promotion.
Oh, congratulations!
Thank you.
Hey, maybe you can


                                 Page 9/112

get your own place now.
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.
Yay!
Let's go celebrate.
Okay. Let's do it.
Pete'll watch the kids?
Yeah!
We can watch
Taxicab Confessions.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know!
I'm so excited!
I walked in on him
masturbating one night.
Did he get the
deer-in-the-headlights look?
Did he freeze
or did he finish?
No, he tried to pretend
like he wasn't doing
anything under the covers.
Oh, no!
I buy these nice towels,
and he whacks off into them.
Deb and Pete, forever.
And...
And once he does that
into them once,
they're never soft ever again.
I can always tell if I'm
looking good based on
whether or not we get in.
Ladies?
Guess we're looking good.
If I didn't get in,
I would've lost my shit.
What's going on, man?
How long you gonna
make us wait out here,
for Christ's sake?
What the fuck?
You know what movie I just
saw again the other day,


                                 Page 10/112

which is fucking, like,
mind-blowing,
and I haven't seen it
since it came out is Munich.
Oh, Munich!
Oh, man, Munich fucking rules.
Munich is awesome!
That movie was Eric Bana
kicking fucking ass!
Dude, every movie with Jews,
we're the ones getting killed.
Munich flips it on its ear.
We're capping motherfuckers.
Not only killing but fucking,
like, taking names.
If any of us get laid tonight,
it's because
of Eric Bana in Munich.
I agree with that.
I agree.
You know what is not
helping us get laid
is the shoe bomber,
Richard Reid,
over here at our table.
I don't like your shoes.
How is Burning Man this year?
Fuck you guys.
I'm glad I'm not Jewish.
So are we.
Yeah, so are we.
Yeah. Fine, screw it.
You weren't chosen
for a reason.
Yeah.
It's like everyone
in here is 12 years old.
Am I too old to be here?
What?
Am I too old to be here?
No, of course not.
Does it look weird
that I'm here?
No, not at all.


                                 Page 11/112

Am I hotter than
these little bitches?
Yes! You look amazing.
Guys in here would
fuck me, right?
Yes.
That's weird to say,
but it makes me feel better.
You look hot.
Okay. I believe you.
Okay. I'm getting us drinks.
Okay.
Yo, a beer over here, please?
You're gonna be embarrassed
when you realize
I'm Wilmer Valderrama.
God.
Hey, hey! Excuse me!
He's literally ignoring
this entire half of the bar.
Don't even bother.
Yeah, awesome.
A beer over here, please?
He looked at us!
Did you see that?
Yeah, that was rough.
Oh, my God. And if
you can't get service,
what am I gonna do, you know?
Great. It's gonna be
that night.
Okay, you want a beer?
Yeah, just...
Well, I'm... Watch this.
Okay? Just observe.
There you go.
Come on, man.
Here you go. For your trouble.
Thank you. There you go.
Thank you.
Okay, enjoy it.
Are you sure?
I am sure.
I tried that once before


                                 Page 12/112

at the Comedy Store,
and I got punched in the ear.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, fuck, fuck!
I'm supposed
to get one for my sister.
Oh, here, take mine.
No, that's okay. I'll wait.
Please, I very rarely
look cool. This is a big
moment for me. Just take it.
Thank you. Awesome.
No problem.
I'm Allison.
I'm Ben.
Well, have a great night.
Yeah, you, too.
Thanks for the beer.
Okay, enjoy, be nice to them.
Bye. Thanks again.
I'll see you.
No, I'll see you later.
No, I won't
'cause I'm a pussy.
What's up, Ben?
That girl. She totally
gave me an opening, man,
and I locked up.
I just want to get
shit-faced tonight,
though, you know.
I'll just jerk it later.
It's cool.
Are you fucking crazy, man?
She looks smart.
Who's that she's sitting with?
It's her sister.
Her sister?
Yeah.
Dude, it's the dream.
What are we doing
standing here, man?
Let's go. Come on, follow me.
You stay here. Stay here.


                                 Page 13/112

Why?
Because your face
looks like a vagina.
Dick!
Hey, which one's
the sister?
Hey, Crockett,
you still partying
with Tubbs these days?
Come on, man. I'm getting
it from all angles here.
I don't like it anymore.
I know. I don't, either.
Was it weird when you changed
your name from Cat Stevens
to Yusuf Islam?
Yeah, it was really awkward.
All right, man.
I got to take off.
See you, Scorsese-on-coke.
What's that?
Chewbacca.
You know, it's Chewie.
Oh, another beard joke.
Fuck.
Fucking hilarious!
Hey.
Hey.
Hi, this is my friend, Jason.
I just wanted to see
how my beers were doing.
This is my sister, Debbie.
Oh, hi, I'm Ben.
Hi. Ben?
Yes.
Nice to meet you.
How you doing?
Good, how are you?
Just trying not to stare.
She's married.
Why do you have to say that?
What?
It's a shame.
You're beautiful.


                                Page 14/112

Thank you.
She has two kids, too.
Shut up!
What? It's nothing
to be ashamed of.
You think that's gonna
stop him from hitting on her?
It's not at all.
I love kids.
Really?
Yeah, absolutely.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Cool phone.
Yeah, she's got
a really cool phone.
What? Is it a rash,
or is it the chicken pox?
I don't know! Google it.
Okay. All right, bye.
I got to go. Sadie might
have the chicken pox.
I had the chicken pox
three times.
I have no immunity to it.
We don't have the heart
to tell him it's herpes.
It's not herpes
if it's everywhere.
Are you coming?
You know, I'm all dressed,
so I'll just hang out.
Really?
Yeah, I'll take a cab home.
Okay. Be safe.
I will. Yeah.
Bye, lovely.
Bye.
All right, I'm gonna let you
two get to know each other.
Cheers.
Cheers.
To you.
No, no. You know, the, like,


                                Page 15/112

Entertainment News channel?
E!
E!
Dude, I think he's doing
the dice thing too much.
That's really all he's got.
I love your curly hair!
It's so great.
Do you, like,
use a product or anything?
No, that's...
I use Jew, it's called.
You wanna get out of here?
Yeah, let's go.
You wanna come back
and hang out at my place?
Yes.
Yeah. Wicked.
I'll show you
my audition tape.
It's really funny.
Okay, I'm really
excited to watch that.
Let's go.
We could get a cab up,
this way. For sure.
This is a big yard.
Let's go swimming right now.
Let's just do that.
I know. It feels so right.
That's right.
Oh, man. Oh, man.
You're prettier than I am.
A lot.
Do you have a condom?
I do.
Okay.
In my pants. I have a condom.
Okay. Okay.
I'll get it.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Stupid fucker.
What are you doing?


                                Page 16/112

I almost got it.
Just give me a second.
Oh, God, just do it already!
Okay.
Oh, great. Okay.
God.
Oh, that's great!
Good thing I'm drunk.
This is lasting forever.
Yeah, it's awesome.
I just doubled my record time.
Oh, yeah. You did.
I'm sorry,
I'm sweating on you.
Okay, just stop talking.
Fuck off, Martin.
I said, fuck off, Martin.
Hi.
Oh. Hey.
Hey.
I'm naked.
Yeah.
Did we have sex?
Yes.
Nice.
What time is it?
Why the fuck are we awake?
Let's go back to sleep.
I have to go to work.
Really?
Do you need to get
to work or anything?
No, I'm... No work today.
Do you wanna get breakfast?
Okay.
Morning.
Good morning, Allison.
I'm Ben.
What's happening, man?
Ben.
How's it going?
Ah, to be young.
Stop it.
You stop it.


                                 Page 17/112

Okay, see you later.
All righty.
See you later. Enjoy the day.
Never do what they did.
I'm gonna do it.
You are? Uh-oh. Someone's
getting home-schooled.
I just yacked something nasty.
I feel way better, though.
I think that's like
the secret. Like you gotta...
I mean, once you're hung-over,
you just gotta puke.
It feels so... Did you puke?
No.
You can. I won't think
it's gross or anything.
Oh, that's okay, I'm fine.
Okay.
I just need some coffee, so...
You know, the best thing
for a hangover is weed.
Do you smoke...
Do you smoke weed?
Not really.
You don't?
No.
At all?
Mmm-mmm.
Like in the morning?
No, I just don't.
You know, it's like...
It is like the best medicine.
Because it fixes everything.
Jonah broke his elbow once.
He just got high,
and it still clicks,
but, I mean, he's okay.
Right.
Yeah.
Last night was great,
what I remember of it.
Right, yeah.
Yeah, no, it was fun.


                                 Page 18/112

We had a great time.
Yeah.
So what do you do?
I work at E!
The television channel?
Uh-huh.
Remember?
Wow!
We had this
conversation last night.
I told you about my promotion.
I was out celebrating it.
No?
No.
I don't remember that at all.
Yeah. I'm super
excited about it.
I'm actually doing my first
on-air interview today, so...
With who?
Matthew Fox.
Matthew Fox from Lost?
Yeah.
You know what's interesting
about him?
What?
Nothing.
What?
Will you tell him
he's an asshole for me?
No.
Someone needs to.
Like who gives a shit?
Well, I hope a lot of people,
actually, because that's
what my job entails
is making sure people care
what he has to say.
I'm interviewing him.
Maybe it's just me. Maybe
I just don't give a shit.
I'm just saying
he deserves a beat-down.
Actually, it's sort


                                 Page 19/112

of embarrassing
to ask at this point,
but what do you do for work?
Me and my roommates
have started a... We're
starting an Internet website.
Oh, cool. What is it?
I'll give you the virtual
experience, okay? How's that?
You're at your computer.
Mmm-hmm.
Who's an actress you like?
Mary Tyler Moore?
No.
That does not work at all.
No?
No.
Okay.
Let's say you love Meg Ryan.
I do.
Great. Who doesn't?
Yeah.
Let's say you like her so much
you wanna know every movie
where she shows her tits.
And not just that,
but how long into that
movie she shows her tits.
You come to our
web page exclusively.
Type in ""Meg Ryan."" Bam!
In the Cut, 38 minutes in,
like an hour and 10 minutes...
She's, like, naked
that whole fucking movie.
She does full frontal
in that movie.
Wow.
They should've called her
Harry, not Sally.
Really.
I'll show it to you.
I'll show you Meg Ryan's bush.
Okay.


                                 Page 20/112

Cool.
Yeah, I actually need
to get going, so...
Well, could...
Can I get your number?
I mean, I don't...
We had fun, right?
We should hook up again.
I'm gonna give you my card
'cause that'll be
the best way to...
Well, I mean, if you want
to contact me, I don't have
a cell, right now,
because of
payment complications.
But, I mean, you can e-mail me
at the web page. I check...
It's just Ben
at flesh-of-the-stars,
one word, dot-com.
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.
Okay.
So, awesome.
All right, then.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah. Okay.
Bye. Take care.
See you.
Bye!
That was fucking brutal.
Yeah, that was brutal.
It was a huge mistake.
What's a mistake?
Nothing. Nothing that we need
to talk about right now.
Why did you do it?
Aunty Allison drank
too much chocolate milk.
And I was feeling weird
because of that.
And I made a...
I think that's enough.


                                 Page 21/112

Okay.
Did he wear a condom?
Yes.
Thank God.
Do you think
you'll do it again?
No, no way.
She was totally
repulsed by me.
What?
She just really
didn't seem to like me.
Like, she wasn't laughing at my jokes.
I mean, I'm like a funny guy.
Fucking funny as balls.
Hilarious, man.
I'm giving her the A shit.
Nothing. She thought our
web page was a bad idea.
What?
That fucking stuck-up bitch.
Yeah, I think so, too.
I think it's awesome
that you had sex with her.
If a goofy guy like you
had sex with her, I feel like
I had sex with her also.
I was so drunk.
I just wish I remembered it.
Hi, I'm Allison Scott.
And we're here today with
James Franco from Spider-Man.
How are you?
Great, great.
Thanks for coming.
Of course.
Tell me, were you
a big fan of the...
I'm sorry,
let me take that again.
Okay.
Tell me, were you a big fan
of the comic books growing up?
No, actually,


                                 Page 22/112

I didn't read any of
the comic books until
I got the movie and then...
Are you okay?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, just what about
the comic books?
Just keep talking.
Like I said,
I really wasn't into them,
but now that I did
the research, I think they're
pretty amazing, like...
Shit.
What the fuck?
Is that the sound
of you puking?
If this is one of those
fucking joke shows,
I'm not into it.
We should put this on YouTube.
Shut up.
This is hilarious.
You're an asshole.
Look how sweaty you are.
You look like Dom DeLuise.
I don't need to see it again.
It's gonna make me throw up.
You look like
Jabba the Hutt dying.
You're such an asshole.
I'm just jerking your chain.
I'll fix this. No problem.
Yeah, maybe if you can just
edit this out, and we can...
We can reshoot my questions.
What's up?
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Over here.
Not on the mix board,
not on the mix board, here.
Are you okay?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.


                                 Page 23/112

Are you sick?
I don't know.
What'd you eat?
I haven't eaten today yet.
You haven't...
Do you have, like,
a napkin or something?
Here, here.
What, do you have,
like, the flu?
I don't know.
God, I hope
you're not pregnant.
It's impossible. You have
to have sex to get pregnant.
B.K. It's Brent Master Five.
Allison just puked.
Dude, that's what I said.
She's probably
pregnant, right?
Oh, shit.
How does she look right now?
She looks like
she just realized
that she's pregnant.
No, I can't be
pregnant. Right?
I mean that was, what?
Eight weeks ago?
When was that?
Mmm-hmm.
Did you miss your period?
No. Wait.
I don't know.
Shit. I don't know.
I can't remember.
I was... I mean, I've been
really stressed at work.
I can't remember
my last period.
Are you the lady who doesn't
realize she's pregnant
till she's sitting
on the toilet


                               Page 24/112

and a kid pops out?
Can you not joke right now?
Don't joke right now.
This is really serious.
Did I meet him?
Yeah. You know, he was
kind of like medium height,
sort of chubby.
Blonde, curly hair. Remember?
With the man-boobs.
Yes.
Here, I have this thing
of him on my phone.
I just watched it.
Hey! I live in your phone!
Oh.
This is the best
night of my life.
I gotta pee.
Yeah.
Oh, God.
How did this happen?
Oh, shit.
Well, there's only
one way to find out.
They're here!
Here they are! Over here!
Oh, no.
Okay, here we are.
Okay.
Okay. All right.
Here.
Oh, no. Give me more!
Give me a few more!
Did you try the Ova-Sure?
I'm dripping,
I'm dripping. Wait.
Oh, good! A smiley face!
Oh, I think that's bad.
How long does this one take?
These can't all be positive.
Let me try one.
God, you really had to pee.
What is this?


                                Page 25/112

What the hell is this?
I think you picked up
the wrong one.
Oh, fuck.
That scared me.
That would suck. I'm sorry.
That scared me.
It's gonna be fine. Right?
Right?
Of course it will be fine.
It's gonna be fine.
You just need to call him.
Maybe I don't need to call him
until after I see the doctor.
You need to call.
I don't want to call him.
I don't need to call him.
You should call.
I can't call him anyway.
He doesn't even have a phone.
He didn't even have
a number to give me.
He doesn't have a phone?
Said he had some
kind of billing issue.
He can't afford a phone?
Sadie has a phone.
Oh, shit, you're right.
I got to call.
I don't know. I'm gonna
have to look him up
on his stupid website.
What kind of website
does he have?
He spelled ""coming""
wrong. Oh, it's cum...
Yeah.
Oh, that's gross.
Just go to ""Contact Us.""
Ben?
Yeah.
""What is your number?
I need to speak
with you right away.""


                                 Page 26/112

Send?
Yep.
You're sure?
Yeah.
I love weed.
I could smoke weed
every second of every day.
Jay, I am your stoner.
Hey, Benjamin?
Yeah.
Flesh of the Stars
just got an e-mail.
Really?
Would you like me
to read it to you?
Yeah, sure.
""Ben, what is your number?
""I need to speak to you
right away. Allison Scott.""
Oh! Shit!
Someone wants seconds, mama!
Oh, man!
""Looking forward
to speaking with you.""
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do one of those
smiley faces at the end.
Fucking-A. Those are sexy.
Sent.
Somebody wants another piece!
Booty-booty call.
Yeah, hello?
Hi.
Hey, Ben, this is...
This is Allison. I don't know
if you remember me.
Oh, yeah, Allison. What's up?
She like the way
your dick tastes.
Yeah, I actually was
just wondering if maybe you
wanted to get together,
like tomorrow night?
I've been meaning


                                Page 27/112

to call you so we could,
like, hook up again.
You know what I'm saying?
Okay, cool.
Let's meet up maybe
tomorrow night? You wanna
just grab some dinner?
Yeah. Why not?
Meeting of minds sounds good.
What do you say Geisha House,

Hollywood, 9:
Sure, sure. That's cool.
Can we make it

more like 6:
I'd like to keep it early.
Yeah, leaves
more time for afterwards.
Dessert. Sweet.
Okay, great.
So, yeah. I'll just meet
you there, then, at 6:00.
Yeah.
I'll see you there.
Okay, take care. Peace.
Oh, shit.
I'm gonna get laid,
motherfucker!
Yes! Yes!
Nice place, huh?
Yeah,
it's really nice.
Sorry it took so long to
get a table. I didn't realize
you needed a reservation.
Oh, no, that's okay.
So how's work?
Great.
How's E!?
Great.
That's awesome.
Do you know Vince Vaughn?
Have you ever met him?


                                Page 28/112

No.
I really feel like
we'd get along well. I just...
He seems like a fun guy.
I feel like we'd, like,
hang together well.
Mmm-hmm.
I feel like he'd like me.
I'm sure a lot of guys
are like, ""Oh, I'd like
to hang out with that celeb"",
but I really think he would
want to hang out with me,
is like the cool thing.
I'm sure he would. Yeah.
You look very pretty, though.
Thanks.
By the way.
Yeah, I just thought...
I don't know, I thought
maybe it'd be cool
to hang out
a little bit and...
We didn't really get
to talk that much
last time, so I thought...
That we didn't.
I thought maybe we'd
just talk and get to know
each other better.
Cool. Okay.
I'll start. I'm Canadian.
Oh, that's cool.
From Vancouver. I live
here illegally, actually.
Don't tell anyone.
But it works out
in my advantage,
I think, ultimately,
'cause I don't have
to pay any taxes.
So financially that's helpful
'cause I don't have
a lot of money.


                                 Page 29/112

You know, I mean,
I'm not poor or anything,
but I eat a lot of spaghetti.
So, you know, the web page
or whatever is just something
that you guys do for fun?
Do you have a real job?
Well, that is our job.
Oh.
We don't technically get money
for the hours we put in,
but it is our job.
So, how do you... Right.
How do I pay rent and shit?
When I was in high school,
I got ran over
by a postal truck.
Oh, my God.
It just kind of...
It was my foot
more than anything.
But I got like 14 grand from
the British Columbia government.
Right.
And that really lasted me.
I mean, until now.
It's been almost 10 years.
I have like 900 bucks left.
So that should last me for,
like, I mean, I'm not
a mathematician,
but like another
two years or some shit.
I think.
Yeah.
So I have something
I really need to tell you.
It's kind of why I called you.
Here goes. Um...
I'm pregnant.
Fuck off.
What?
What?
I'm pregnant.


                                   Page 30/112

With emotion?
With a baby.
You're the father.
I'm the father?
Yes.
How the fuck
could this happen?
I don't know.
I don't know. I mean,
I thought you were
wearing a condom.
No.
What?
I wasn't.
Why not?
Because you told me not to.
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
You told me not to.
I did not tell you
not to wear a condom.
Here's what happened, okay?
I will give you a play-by-play
of my memory.
I almost had
the condom on my dick.
It was on the cusp,
and then you said,
""Just do it, already.""
I didn't mean do it
without a condom.
I meant ""do it""
like ""hurry up,""
like ""Get fucking going!""
Well, I assumed
you were wearing a patch,
or like a dental dam
or one of those
fucking butterfly clips
or something like that.
What the hell is a dental dam?
It's like Saran Wrap!
It's disgusting, okay?
But I thought you had one.


                                 Page 31/112

Why the fuck didn't you
stop me once we started?
I don't know! I couldn't tell
that you didn't have one on!
Obviously, I was drunk!
Was your vagina drunk?
Did you think
it's the thinnest condom
on earth I have on?
I'm a fucking inventor?
I made a dick-skin condom?
He hollowed out
a penis and put it on?
What the fuck?
You are unbelievable.
Okay, you know what? Maybe
I've reacted unfavorably.
So what happens now?
I don't know how this works.
I am going to
the doctor next week,
and I thought you could
come with me
to the gynecologist.
So you haven't seen him,
though?
No.
So you don't know
if you're pregnant.
Well, I'm not 100% sure.
You're not 100% sure.
I bet you're not pregnant.
No, they're not.
No, they're all in the bag.
They're in the bag.
Allison Scott?
Yeah. Come on.
I'm supposed to come?
Yes.
Hello. My name is
Thomas Pellagrino.
I'm... I'm Ben Stone.
Hi, there, champ.
Nice to meet you.


                                Page 32/112

And you must be
Debbie's sister.
Yeah.
Alice.
Allison. Hi.
Hi. How are you?
Good.
So, what can
I help you with today,
Mr. and Mrs. Stone?
I took a home pregnancy test,
and it said I was pregnant,
so here we are.
Okay. Let's have a look.
Legs up.
Nice office.
Thank you.
Well, you do look
a lot like your sister.
This is gonna be cold.
And you're next.
Okay, there is
the cervix and the uterus.
See that?
That dark sac there,
that's the amniotic sac.
And right there
in the middle is the embryo.
Do you see that flicker?
You know what that is?
Yeah, that's a heartbeat.
Yeah, it looks like
you are pregnant.
About eight or nine weeks,
I'd say.
Congratulations.
That... That's it?
Yep.
Take good care of it.
Now the fun part starts.
Let me... Let me make
a picture for you, huh?
That'll be fun.
Okay. Well, I'II...


                                Page 33/112

I'll meet you in my office.
Okay.
I'll give you
a little time alone, there.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
It's okay.
I can't fucking believe
you didn't wear a bag!
Who does that?
Why did we go to Costco
and buy a year's supply
of condoms
if you weren't gonna
use them, man?
I can't believe you did this.
You fucked everything up.
Look, the real point
is not to get yourself
in this position.
That's what
you have to realize.
You gotta know
all the tricks.
Like, for example,
if a woman's on top,
she can't get pregnant.
It's just gravity.
Well, that's true.
Everyone knows that.
What goes up must come down.
I think it's awesome that
you're gonna have a kid, man.
Think about it like this.
It's just an excuse to play
with all your old toys again.
You know what
I think you should do?
Take care of it.
Tell me you don't want him
to get an ""A"" word.
Yes, I do, and I won't say it
for little Baby Ears
over there,


                                Page 34/112

but it rhymes
with ""Shma-shmortion.""
I'm just saying...
Hold on, Jay, cover your ears.
You should get
a shma-shmortion
at the shma-shmortion clinic.
Ben, you cannot let
these monsters have
any part of your child's life.
All right? I'm gonna be
there to rear your child.
You hear that, Ben?
Don't let him near the kid.
He wants
to rear your child!
I just have a quick question.
Do you use that Canadian
flag tattoo as a cum target
of some sort?
How many points do you get if you hit
the leaf? Like a million?
Jonah, I am a patriot.
This is a tribute to my
country and my countrymen.
I always aim right.
Right into a dude's ass.
Please, guys.
Ben, come on, man.
I'm just kidding you.
Oh, great. Now he's upset.
I won't let him do it.
Allison, just take care of it.
Take care of it. Move on.
What's gonna happen
with your career?
How are you gonna tell them?
I'm not gonna tell them
for a while.
I have a while
before I have to say anything.
How could you not tell them?
They're not gonna know.
I mean, I'm only gonna start


                                 Page 35/112

to show when I'm like,
I don't know,
six months or something.
Seven months.
Three months.
No.
Three months. Fat in the face,
jowls, fat ass.
Debbie didn't get fat.
Debbie is a freak of nature.
Mom, you know,
it's important to me
that you be supportive.
I cannot be supportive
of this. This is a mistake.
This is a big, big mistake.
Now, think about
your stepsister.
Now, you remember
what happened with her?
She had the same
situation as you,
and she had it taken care of.
And you know what?
Now she has a real baby.
Honey, this is not the time.
I'm gonna be a grandfather.
You happy about that?
Absolutely. Delighted.
This is a disaster.
No, this is not a disaster.
It is...
An earthquake is a disaster.
Your grandmother
having Alzheimer's so bad
she doesn't even know
who the fuck I am,
that's a disaster.
This is a good thing.
This is a blessing.
I have a vision
for how my life would go,
and this definitely is not it.
Wait. Is this your vision?


                                 Page 36/112

Are you living
your vision right now?
I am kind of living
my vision, yeah.
Well, that is sad,
I'm telling you.
Life doesn't care
about your vision. Okay?
Stuff happens.
You just got to deal with it.
You roll with it.
That's the beauty of it all.
I just don't get how I tell
the kid not to do drugs
when I do drugs.
I'll feel like a hypocrite.
Well, remember what I told you
when you were a teenager?
What did you say?
I said,
""No pills, no powders.""
That's right, that's right.
Right. If it grows
in the ground,
it's probably okay.
I mean, I guess it worked.
Like you told me not
to smoke pot all those years,
and then I found out
you were smoking pot
that whole time.
Not the whole time.
Just in the evenings
and all day every weekend.
Not that much.
Honestly, though,
when you look at me
do you not think at all, like,
""You know,
if he just never existed,
""I would have avoided
a massive heap of trouble,""
you know?
Absolutely not.


                                 Page 37/112

I love you totally
and completely.
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.
I'm the best thing
that ever happened to you?
Yeah.
Now I just feel bad for you.
Hello?
Hi. Ben?
Oh. Hey, Allison.
How's it going?
Good, good.
You know,
I was just calling to...
To let you know that I've
decided to keep the baby.
I'm keeping it.
Oh.
Yeah. So, that's
what's happening with that.
Good. That's good. That's what
I was hoping you'd do.
So, awesome.
Yeah. Yeah, it is good.
Okay, I know
we didn't plan this,
and, you know,
neither of us really thought
it was gonna happen,
but life is like that,
you know,
you can't plan for it.
And even if we did plan,
life doesn't care about
your plans, necessarily.
And you just kind of have
to go with the flow and,
you know,
I know my job is to just
support you in whatever
it is you wanna do,
and, I'm in, you know.
So whatever you wanna do,


                                 Page 38/112

I'm gonna do,
you know. It's...
I'm on board. Yay!
I really appreciate
you saying that.
No problem.
You know, so I'll tell you,
you know, maybe if you could
help me by telling me, like,
one thing that I am
supposed to do,
then that would be good,
because I literally have
no idea whatsoever.
I have no idea, either.
So, do you want to, like,
get together and talk about it
or something like that?
Yeah, sure.
Like a date? I mean...
Yeah.
Hey.
Hi.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
No problem. Come on in.
Everyone,
this is Allison.
Hi.
Ally. Hey. Jason,
I'm sure you remember.
Yes.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Your body's responding
really well to the pregnancy.
Thank you.
It's amazing
how fast the milk arrives.
Oh.
How's your sis?
She's good.
Oh, good. Tell her,
""What's up?"" for me.


                                 Page 39/112

Okay.
All right, I'm gonna go make
a protein shake.
And this beautiful
young man is Jonah.
Hi.
Hey.
Okay, that's Martin
and Jodi over there.
Hi.
I'm gonna grab my shirt.
Just take a seat if you want.
Okay.
Cool.
You are scared, aren't you?
Just another day
at the office.
Uh-huh.
Do you have
any acting experience?
No. Uh-huh.
How's it going?
You wanna toke?
No. I'm good.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Jodi.
Yeah, hi.
I heard you were pregnant.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, aren't you scared?
The way it's gonna
come out of your...
It's gonna hurt a lot, I bet.
Your vagina...
That's so sick.
I don't know.
Are you hungry?
No, I'm okay right now.
Thank you.
You must be angry
at the baby whenever
it steals your food, huh?
""Oh, it's mine, not yours.""


                                Page 40/112

But, you know,
because you're family,
you got to share.
Right.
Man, my balls are shaved.
My pubes are trimmed.
I'm ready to fucking
rock this shit.
What the fuck, man?
If I go in there and see
fucking pubes sprinkled
on the toilet seat,
I'm gonna fucking
lose my mind!
Last time I went
to the bathroom, Jay,
I took a shit and my shit looked
like a fucking stuffed animal!
You're embarrassing me
in company.
You embarrass yourself.
Oh, great. I hope you have
a great evening!
All right. Let's go.
Okay.
See you guys later.
The funny thing is I really
had never even thought
about having a baby.
Yeah.
I mean, if this
hadn't happened,
I don't think I would have
wanted to have a baby for like,
I don't know,
at least 10 years.
At least!
God, I mean, honestly,
I just got used to the, like,
notion that someone would even
have sex with me.
I didn't think
this would happen.
Get ready.


                                   Page 41/112

This will be coming out of you
in seven months.
This is exactly what
our baby will look like.
It's a beautiful picture, Ben.
It is. It's not bad.
Hello, Mommy.
Our baby's gonna be
French-Canadian.
With a little hint
of Spanish.
Exactly. I'm not good
with accents, but...
Baby books.
Awesome.
""What to Expect
When You're Expecting. ""
What can we expect?
Well, you can't eat sushi.
You can't smoke.
You can't smoke marijuana.
You can't smoke crack.
You can't jump on trampolines.
This is basically a giant list
of things you can't do.
Yeah, it sounds thrilling.
I'm gonna be sitting there
on the trampoline
smoking crack.
And you're not gonna have
anything to do.
You're gonna be bored.
But I can't wait
to read these, honestly.
Seriously, I put these
in front of my toilet, though,
they'll be read
by tomorrow morning.
Do you want me
to get you that?
Yeah.
You like it?
Yeah, thank you.
No problem.


                                 Page 42/112

These are heavy.
So what do you think?
Should we have sex tonight?
Sounds awful.
I'm just really constipated.
Do you really want to?
Well, now...
Shut up.
It's pretty crazy,
your sister's pregnant.
We have to help her.
I think they'll be fine.
Look at us. It happened to us.
We'll help her raise the baby.
Well...
Fuck!
At least we don't have
to use a condom, you know?
But we can. I don't...
I brought some
just in case. I don't...
I don't have VD or anything.
I mean, I don't, I thought...
It's not that.
You know, it's just...
I thought maybe we could get
a little fun out of
your situation, you know?
Okay, first of all,
it's not my situation.
It's our situation.
I know, of course,
I know that.
And just because I'm pregnant,
I'm not some ruined woman
and all romance
goes out the door.
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
It's just...
I like you a lot.
That's all this is. That's...
I like you, too.
Sweet.
A little, so far.


                                 Page 43/112

I mean, we have seven months
before the baby comes.
We don't have to rush it.
Yeah.
We should really just try
to get to know each other
and give this a real shot.
You know, we got ourselves
into this situation.
We kind of have to.
For the baby, right?
Exactly.
Okay, if this was our second
date, what would you do?
B.J., if I'm just being
honest, I would probably...
I told my roommates
I thought I was gonna
get a B.J., so...
You know what?
For the sake of getting
to know one another,
can you not talk like that?
Yeah, I can do that.
I'm... I'm really nervous.
I'm nervous, too.
I'm really nervous.
Yeah.
You're a sweet guy, right?
I think I am. Yeah.
Don't fuck me over, okay?
I wouldn't do that.
Just so you know,
I'm the guy girls fuck over.
I'm that guy.
So you don't fuck me over.
Okay?
Okay.
I couldn't take it.
I can't raise this baby alone.
Who's he?
I'm Ben Stone.
He's my boyfriend.
That's nice.


                                 Page 44/112

I've never met him before.
Well, he's a new boyfriend.
But a boyfriend.
So he came over
for breakfast because
he's your new boyfriend?
Yeah.
He came from his house.
Drove over to our house
because he thought
it would be fun
to have breakfast with us,
so he drove his car
from his house to our house
to have breakfast.
Because he likes
breakfast so much.
I love breakfast.
You guys wanna hear something neat?
We're gonna have a baby together.
What?
Yeah, a baby.
Well, you're not married.
Aren't you supposed
to be married to have a baby?
You don't have to be.
But they should be
because they love each other,
and people who love each other
get married and have babies.
Mmm-mmm.
Do you love each other?
Yes, they love each other.
Because that's what you do.
When you love each other,
you get married
and have a baby.
Where do babies come from?
Where do you think
they come from?
Well, I think a stork,
he drops it down,
and then a hole goes
in your body,


                                 Page 45/112

and there's blood everywhere,
coming out of your head,
and then you push
your belly button,
and then your butt falls off,
and then you hold your butt
and you have to dig,
and you'll find a little baby.
That's exactly right.
Feed the teddy bear.
Okay, I feed
your bear the grass?
Okay.
You know what your bear
would also like
to do with some grass?
Smoke it.
What do you think of him?
He's funny, right?
Mmm-hmm.
Fetch.
All right, bring it back.
He's playing fetch
with my kids.
He's treating my kids
like they're dogs.
No, he's not.
Go get it! Fetch!
Who plays fetch
with kids?
He's trying.
He's making an effort.
Bring it back.
He's overweight.
Where does that end?
How old is he?
Looks 33.
He can barely get in and out
of that little house.
Imagine how much bigger
he's gonna get.
That means he has bad genes.
Your kid is gonna
be overweight.


                                 Page 46/112

Shit.
I'm gonna get you!
I'm gonna get...
Just give him a break.
Okay. I'll try.
They seem to love bubbles.
Oh, God. They go
ape shit over bubbles.
They're really going ape shit.
I mean, that's an incredible
thing about a child.
I mean, what's so great
about bubbles?
They float. You can pop them.
I mean, I get it. I get it.
I wish I liked anything as much
as my kids like bubbles.
That's sad.
It's totally sad.
Their smiling faces just
point out your inability
to enjoy anything.
Am I gonna be okay, man?
Oh, who knows?
Is anybody okay? I'm not okay.
You're asking the wrong guy.
Just don't ask me to lend you
any money, you know?
Can I just have some?
No.
I have 15 years
of tennis lessons.
And 12 years
of sucking dick lessons.
So?
I can't ref the next games,
by the way.
I got to go meet
gynecologists with Allison.
She doesn't like
her gynecologist.
You think she likes you?
She's trying to.
She's entertaining


                                  Page 47/112

the idea of liking you.
Exactly. I'll take that.
Yeah, well, see,
she's bringing you
to the gynaechiatrist.
She must like you.
Yeah. Pretty good, I think.
You know who
I'd like to get pregnant,
is that Felicity Huffman, man.
Ever since Transamerica, I can't
get her out of my mind.
Okay, guys. I hate to
crack the whip,
but it's kind of
business meeting time.
I need moolah.
When do you think
we can launch this site?
Jeez.
Look, man. You can't rush this.
You know what happens
to these sites when they go up
and they don't function well?
They die.
Seriously, guys, let's say
I want to launch today.
Let's start. Let's use that
as a jumping off point.
Let's make this happen.
What can we do?
Look, man, I didn't go
to Yale so I could work
I thought you went
to Santa Monica City College.
I went where I went, Jason.
I'm not asking you
to work 12 hours a day.
I mean, you guys watch movies
without nudity in them.
I'll tell you what, man.
We could probably
get it online in three months.
Thank you. Yes! Three months.


                                   Page 48/112

Come on, Jason!
Fuck off!
Yeah, well, you still have
a little dick, Cartman.
Do you have mints?
Yeah, right there.
I see what you're saying.
Totally.
I don't get how
you're comfortable
with any of these guys
when they're doing
what they're doing to you.
First guy...
Oh, there that shit is.
I've been looking for that.
The first guy,
when he put his finger in,
he gave me this look like,
""Sorry, man, it's the job""
and I'm like, ""Don't look
at me when your finger's...""
I mean, get in and get out.
Get on with your day,
you know?
That's the closest
I'll ever come to being
in a threesome, I think.
Really?
If you had to do a threesome
with me and one
of my other roommates,
who would it be?
Um...
I'm gonna have to go with Jay.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
Jay?
I'm really turned on by his
sort of skinny awkwardness
and his hot little Mohawk.
His Mohawk.
You two are never allowed to be in
the same room ever again.


                                 Page 49/112

If we ever had a three-way
with Jay, you turn around,
he'd be sucking my dick.
I'm telling you right now.
Do you smoke cigarettes?
No.
Do you smoke cigarettes?
I have on occasion.
On occasion? When? When was
the last time you had one cig?
You know, one, you know, little...
I need to know,
or I will not be your doctor.
How you doing?
I'm breathing like James
Gandolfini over here.
Slow down, man.
You're making me look
like a jackass.
How long you kids
been married?
We're not.
No.
You're single?
She's not single.
She's just not married.
Are you two together?
Hey, you wanna
trade boyfriends?
Just kidding. Kind of.
That is not your vagina.
That's your asshole.
That happens
about five times a day.
Are you sure you don't
wanna come paintballing?
Have fun, guys. Seriously.
Watch the eyes.
See you, guys.
See you, Ally. Bye.
I don't wanna go.
I swear to God.
I wanna see Breathless
at the LACMA.


                                 Page 50/112

Boobs! Boobs, boobs, boobs!
Hold on, pause it,
pause it, pause it.
Boobs and bush!
Boobs and bush.
Good boobs.
Those are good ones!
We're like
Right in
the beginning credits.
Credit bush.
You never get
opening credit bush.
I know. That's so crazy.
No.
You got me.
You got me.
How many doctors are there
in your practice?
Just 'cause I'm sort of
looking for a more
personal experience.
I wanna make sure
that you're my doctor
on the day, and...
Yeah, I understand.
We have three other doctors
in the practice,
but I'm your man, okay?
I don't take vacations.
I hate Hawaii.
I went to the Caribbean
when I was 14,
and I'm never going back.
I feel really good about this.
I think we found our doctor.
Really?
Yeah.
All right.
Are you serious right now?
Yeah.
Wow.
You look relieved.
I am very relieved.


                                 Page 51/112

I can't imagine meeting
any more of you people.
You're being dramatic.
We didn't meet that many.
Do they know?
Pardon?
The belly.
Oh, yeah. The donuts,
they call to me.
Hey, Allison. Great job.
Thanks.
You're pregnant, aren't you?
What?
I mean, you've put on like,
eight pounds, nine.
It's all in your uterus.
Oh, shit.
I haven't told them.
Do you think
they're gonna be mad?
I'm, like, really
chickening out about this.
It's okay. We can hide this.
We'll dress you in black,
and we'll emphasize
your boobs.
Awesome.
I mean, your boobs
are gonna be big.
And then they're
gonna be, like, scary big.
But then they'll go down.
And then they'll stay down.
Just... Just don't
say anything, okay?
Please don't say anything.
Oh, no, I won't, I won't.
Just tell them. They'll be cool.
Everybody loves
somebody pregnant.
Did you see
this sex offender website?
These are all the sex
offenders in our neighborhood.


                                   Page 52/112

Looks like your computer
has chicken pox.
Those are sex offenders.
These people live
in our neighborhood.
Well, I'll skip their houses
when we're trick-or-treating.
What do you want me to do?
Form a posse?
Got your six-shooter on you?
I got my lynching rope.
You shouldn't take it
so lightly.
I don't take it lightly.
You know, I'm not gonna
go over to any of these
people's houses and say,
""Hey, do you mind...
Can you baby-sit?""
If I didn't care about
these things,
you wouldn't
care about anything.
Care more.
You're so concerned
with stuff, like
""Don't get them vaccinated.
""Don't let them eat fish.
There's mercury in the water.""
Jesus, how much
Dateline NBC can you watch?
I know we're supposed
to be nice
with each other right now,
but I'm having
a really hard time.
I'm struggling
with it right now.
What am I doing?
'Cause I want to rip your
fucking head off because
you're so fucking stupid!
This is scary.
These are our children.


                                 Page 53/112

Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
You fucking dipshit.
God! You...
Mmm-hmm.
I literally am at a point where
I don't know what I can say.
So I'm the bad guy
because I'm trying to protect
our kids from child molesters
and mercury?
And you're cool
'cause you don't give a shit.
Yeah.
Yeah? Is that it?
Pretty much.
God, you're an asshole.
Don't do this in front of Ben.
I don't give a shit about Ben.
Sorry, Ben.
It's okay. I didn't think
she did, anyway.
Okay, come on! Let's go.
Oh, I can't go.
This band is doing a showcase
out in the Valley. I got to go.
It's Saturday.
I got to go.
You don't want to know
the sex of the baby?
That's no fun.
Ben knows, but I've
sworn him to secrecy.
I'll get it out of him.
No.
Hey.
Think we'll ever be as happy
as Baby Bjrn couple is?
We are that happy.
Yeah. You look happy.
Which is awesome,
'cause I never like
guys like you. It's great.
You keep saying that. I know.
This is it. This is perfect.


                                  Page 54/112

Nice.
Holy shit! It's 1,400 bucks.
We can just borrow yours.
Is that okay?
No. You need your own crib.
You know, there's one
of these lying in an alley
behind my house.
We could just grab that.
Just rub Purell all over it.
You know what? Let me buy it.
I need to get you
a baby present anyway.
And I would love
to get it for you.
No.
I'm serious. I want to.
No. It's too much.
Yes. We'll take it.
Obviously, I mean,
don't insult the woman.
She wants to get us a gift.
Right.
Wanna buy me some new shoes?
What else can I
squeeze out of you?
Xbox 360. Xbox 360.
So hot in the Valley.
Hey! Oh, Allison!
Hi.
How are you?
It's so good to see you.
We've been watching you on E!
It's the coolest thing.
Yeah, it's been super
exciting, just crazy busy.
I'm so sorry I haven't called.
Oh, it's fine.
Hi, I'm Ashley.
This is my friend, Ben.
I'm Ben.
I went to school with Allison.
Okay, so, is Debbie
having another baby?


                                 Page 55/112

No. Allison is.
What? I just saw you
a couple months ago.
You're pregnant?
It was a big surprise.
It's actually... It's a really
funny story, actually.
If you guys... If you got
a second to hear it.
It's not really funny.
It's not funny.
Let them be the judge, okay?
I think it's funny.
You know they say
don't drink and drive?
Uh-huh.
Don't drink and bone!
Wow.
Okay.
Yeah, I mean,
she was acting weird,
and I really think
it's just 'cause, like,
you know, I haven't made
an honest woman out of her.
She's carrying my bastard child.
No one wants that.
That's what I did.
I mean, I married Debbie
when she got pregnant.
You think she's, like,
hiding me?
Like, she's, like, embarrassed
by me or something like that?
Probably. I'd hide you.
How much do wedding rings cost?
I mean, it really depends,
you know?
I think you're supposed to spend,
like, three months' pay on a ring.
That'll be easy.
I don't make any money.
Really? I thought there was
lot of money in porn.


                                 Page 56/112

God, it's not porn, okay?
All we do is we show you
what nude scenes
are in what movies.
Oh, like Mr. Skin?
Who's Mr. Skin?
Dude, Mr. Skin.
Mr. Skin?
No!
We've wasted
This is exactly
the same as our site.
How the fuck did this happen?
Mr. Skin. That's even
a better name than ours!
Fuck me in the beard.
Dude, they got the top 10
group shower scenes!
Why didn't you think
of that, Jay?
Don't put this on me!
God damn it!
Well, shit, I saw it online
at one point, but I guess
I didn't connect the dots.
What are we gonna do now?
All we need to do is think
of a new, better idea
that no one else
has thought of already.
Oh, dude, Spider-Man 3
starts in eight minutes.
Don't worry, man.
We'll figure it out.
You know what?
I think just because
this site exists
doesn't mean our site
won't work, necessarily.
Good things come
in pairs, man, you know.
Oh, for sure.
Volcano, Dante's Peak,
Deep Impact, Armageddon, right?


                                  Page 57/112

Wyatt Earp, Tombstone.
Panda Express,
Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.
Exactly. We can work together.
This can help us,
if anything, I think.
We're fine. We're golden.
Look, Allison, I'm sure
this isn't how you pictured
it being, exactly,
and it's not
how I wanted it to be,
but that is why I'm presenting
you this empty box.
It's a promise, Allison.
It's a promise
that one day I will...
I will fill this box
with a ring that you deserve,
a beautiful ring.
And I can't afford it yet.
I've picked it out already,
though, and it's at De Beers,
and it's really nice.
So basically I'm asking you,
will you marry me?
Because I'm in love with you.
I love you, too.
Really?
Oh, man,
that's so nice to hear.
That's the first time a girl's
ever said that to me, so...
But here's the thing.
There's a thing?
I don't really know yet what
that love means, you know.
Just 'cause it's so new,
and it's so exciting
that it's great.
I don't know. We've only
known each other
Okay.
Honestly, I mean, I thought...


                                 Page 58/112

I thought you felt weird
that we're having a baby
and we're not
engaged or anything.
I'm gonna get off my knee.
Yeah.
It's hurting a little bit.
No, I'm okay with that.
You know, we're just doing
what we can.
We're making the best of it,
and I don't want us
to put any more pressure
on ourselves
than we already have.
Okay. Yeah.
That makes perfect sense.
Are you okay? I don't want
to hurt your feelings.
No, no, no.
Honestly, I just wanted
to do right by you, you know?
So if you don't want to,
that's totally cool, you know?
Okay.
I really do love you.
I know. Thanks.
You mentioned that. It's nice.
Ben proposed to me.
What?
He did.
It was really sweet.
I kind of feel
a little bit bad about it.
He was, like, wearing
this great little button-down.
He tucked his shirt in.
He got down on one knee.
It was so sweet.
He didn't have
an actual ring, though.
It was just an empty box.
But, you know,
he had this whole spiel


                                 Page 59/112

about when he has the money,
he's gonna buy me
the ring that I deserve and...
The box was just empty?
I mean, he can't
afford a ring, so...
So he got down on one knee
and gave you an empty box?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Get over it. It was sweet.
I'm telling you,
if you'd been there,
you would have probably cried.
You need to train him.
Huh?
Oprah said that
when two people meet,
they are forced
to point out each other's
differences and flaws.
I thought you were supposed
to just accept people for who
they are, love them anyway.
You criticize them a lot,
and then they get
so down on themselves
that they're forced to change.
Really? You don't think
that would just make it worse?
That'd be, like, naggy.
And then in the end,
they thank you for it.
You can't commit
to him. You can't make
a commitment to him.
You don't even know him.
I don't even know Pete
after 10 years.
What?
I don't know what he's up to.
He's miserable.
Why do you say that?
I think he's cheating on me.


                                 Page 60/112

What?
He's always going off
to these business meetings
at odd hours.
And then I try to call him
on his cell phone,
and he says that he's in bad
cell phone reception areas
when he's in good
cell phone reception areas.
Maybe he's working late.
You know, I mean, maybe
he's just working really hard
to sign a new great band
or something.
I can't imagine Pete doing
something like that.
There's no part of you
that thinks that maybe
he's a dirty little scumbag?
No. Mmm-mmm.
I think he might be.
""Memory Spy,
web memory software.
""Locate history files,
websites visited,
""hidden downloads, searches,
email history. Memory Spy.""
Let's see you hide
from me now, little man.
So you're not even
gonna tell them?
No. You know,
I don't have to tell them.
It's illegal for them
to fire me over it anyway,
and I get three months
maternity leave if I stay,
so I'm just, you know,
not gonna tell them.
That's a good plan.
Yeah. I like it.
It is a good plan until
her water breaks all over


                                Page 61/112

Robert De Niro's shoes.
""My shoes!
Hey, there's all this
baby goo on it.""
""These shoes? On these shoes?
""Did you puke on my shoes?""
""Did your water break
on my shoes?""
""Did you puke on my shoes?""
Oh, my God.
Isn't it weird, though,
when you have a kid
and all your dreams and hopes
just go right out the window?
What changed for you?
What went out the window?
What plans?
You do everything
exactly the same.
No, I mean, I love
what I'm doing. Like, say...
Okay, say, you know,
before you're married
and have children,
you wanna go live
in India for a year.
You can do it.
But you can't do it
once you have a family.
You wanna go live in India?
I don't wanna go
live in India.
Do you want to go to India?
Go to India! Seriously,
go to India.
What about you?
Do you want to go to India?
I'm not going to India.
You can go to India.
I get what he's talking about.
You know, honestly, like,
when I found out about...
I totally, like, I just had this flash
of me, like in a white Ford Bronco,


                                 Page 62/112

and I'm just hauling ass
for Canada, man.
The chopper's taping
the whole thing, and I just...
I bust through the border
and I'm a free man!
That's all I kept thinking, man.
You know what I'm saying?
It was a flash!
Wait. What do you mean?
What are you...
Don't look at me.
We can talk
about our fears here.
It's not like he did it.
I mean, honestly, like,
if Doc Brown screeched up
in front of you in the DeLorean.
Open the door, he's like,
""Hey, Allison, come on. I got
the car here. What do you wanna do?""
No part of your brain would have been,
like, ""You know, maybe we'll go back
""to that night and I would maybe
put a condom on Ben's dick.""
You never got that flash?
No.
And I don't know
what you're talking about.
""Where we're going,
we don't need roads.""
Exactly.
You wouldn't do that?
I don't know who Doc Brown is.
What are you talking about?
Doc Brown is the guy
who's Christopher Lloyd.
He invented the DeLorean,
the time machine.
He's the one who made
the time machine.
What?
It's the time machine.
Everyone has


                                 Page 63/112

the time machine image.
Hey. I have
a really good idea.
Why don't the two of you
get into your time machine,
go back in time
and fuck each other?
Who needs a time machine?
This is my time machine!
I'm gonna throw you
in my DeLorean, gun it to '88.
You are a funny motherfucker,
man. Jesus.
How can you fight with him?
Look at his face.
I just want to kiss it.
I think he's cute.
I like the way you move.
This is fun! We should
do this more, I think.
I mean, this is, like,
the most fun I've had
in a really long time.
Come on, harder.
I can't do it harder.
Why? Come on.
Come on, just do it. Deeper.
I can't.
Oh, why?
I'll poke the baby
if I go deeper.
Oh, come on! Just do it!
Please, don't yell at me,
please don't.
What? The doctor and Debbie
said it's fine. Come on!
Look, can we... I'm sorry,
can we change positions?
What?
I'm gonna crush the baby.
I know it.
This is ridiculous!
Why are we...
No, it's not.


                                 Page 64/112

There's no shell in there,
you know?
Millions of people have sex
when they're pregnant!
I don't know how it works.
It just works, okay?
Just do it.
All I'm thinking of
is that I'm gonna...
I weigh over 200 pounds.
Just get over it!
I can't do it.
Can you just get on top?
All I see is our baby
getting poked in the face
by my penis.
Trust me,
you're not even close.
Okay.
Come on, fine.
Okay, fine.
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
That's okay.
Sorry.
Okay. Oh, good.
I can't. I can't.
I can't. I can't do this,
I just... I can't. I can't.
I can't focus like this.
I look disgusting
from this angle. I can feel
you looking up at my chins.
I know I look gross.
No, you look beautiful.
Your chin looks so skinny.
And my boobs are all,
like, squishy, and they're
flopping around.
I can feel it,
and it's distracting.
No...
It's all National Geographic.
Okay. Can we do...
Do you wanna do doggie style?


                                Page 65/112

No. I do not want you
to fuck me like a dog.
I'm not fucking you
like a dog. It's doggie style.
It's just the style.
It's not...
It's not like a dog.
We don't have
to go outside or anything.
Here we go.
Okay. Okay.
Okay, is it good?
Yeah.
Should I go slower?
Yeah, no, that's good.
Okay, faster?
Harder.
Just tell me
when you're close.
Just go harder.
Okay.
Keep going!
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck!
What?
What happened?
Oh, my God.
The baby, it kicked my hand.
Well, no, no, it always kicks.
No, no, no. Not like this.
No, it's fine. It's fine.
Just keep going.
It was a warning kick.
This was a bad kick.
No, no, it's fine.
It's fine! It's fine!
Look, my dick must be like
an inch away from its face,
and it's coming,
just coming in at its face.
Oh, shit.
What if it kicked
'cause it didn't like it?
I can't do that to our baby.


                                 Page 66/112

That's the first thing it's gonna see.
What are you talking about?
It's having the baby between,
you know, us,
it just makes it weird.
I'm sorry.
It just freaks me out a bit.
It's a little weird.
I have totally lost it.
You've totally lost it?
I've lost it.
Okay.
Great, you know what?
Just forget it.
Okay. Okay, fine.
Don't worry. I won't
make you do this again.
Shit.
Fuck me!
Oh, my God. It's the Russians!
Jodi, I'll protect you!
Oh, man!
Ben!
Oh, my God.
Oh, God. Oh, no!
Oh, God, that was horrible!
That was so horrible!
When will it be light out?
Okay, you're fine, man.
Take it easy.
Hey, did anybody
turn off the gas?
I didn't do it.
Oh, motherfucker.
Hey, Marty.
Yeah.
This is my friend, Alex.
She's a pretty
incredible person.
Okay. Nice to meet you.
Whoa, dude! Not cool, Martin.
That's... That wasn't...
Hey, are you serious,
Howard Hughes?


                                 Page 67/112

JODl:
Nothing.
Nothing happened.
Come on.
Where were you?
Look, I forgot
you were sleeping over.
I'm sorry, okay?
Yeah, 'cause you're getting
high off your huge bong.
How am I supposed
to be comfortable
with the idea that you can
take care of me and the baby
if you are always
getting high?
You want me to stop smoking pot
'cause there's an earthquake
once every 10 years?
That makes no sense, Allison.
Look, you're being irrational.
Just relax, okay?
We're all scared, you know?
You just...
Oh, shit, the cops.
California, eh?
You know, it's times like this
I'm glad I don't own nice things.
It's a big mess,
but there's only like
$50 worth of shit here.
And that's kind of the good thing.
You know, my dad told me,
""Don't move to Northridge.""
But you figure, like, what are
the chances of that happening
twice, you know?
What is this?
It's a ninja weapon.
I hope this place
doesn't get condemned.
That would suck.
Hello?


                                 Page 68/112

Hey, it's me.
You!
Hi. So, listen.
Will you do me a big favor?
Debbie wants us to come over
and have dinner tonight.
She thinks Pete is cheating on her.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, she saw
one of his emails and...
Oh, man.
There's an address.
That sounds terrible.
I don't want to do that.
Ben, come on.
He's not cheating on her.
How do you know?
I just know.
Are you sure?
I'm 100% sure
he's not cheating.
Are you really?
No.
It actually kind of makes sense
that he would cheat.
Why?
'Cause Debbie's a pain in the ass
and Pete's awesome.
Why don't you just come over
then, and we'll just diffuse
the situation a little.
I'm just saying the music industry
is different now.
You can't...
Steely Dan would never
even have a chance.
Well, maybe it's 'cause
Steely Dan gargles my balls.
They're incredible.
They really
aren't good, man.
Old Steely Dan.
If I ever listen to Steely Dan,


                                 Page 69/112

I want you to slice my head
off with an Al Jarreau LP.
Oh, I should get going.
I'm supposed to see this
band tonight in Hollywood.
Actually, they're playing
in Laurel Canyon,
so I'll call you 'cause
the reception's terrible
over there, so...
Okay.
And I don't want you to worry
'cause I know you worry.
I'm just gonna jump
in the shower.
It would be terrible if I smelled
worse than the band.
Okay. Have fun.
All right.
You guys are crazy.
He's acting totally normal
and hilarious.
She doesn't have a gun,
does she?
No. I don't think so.
Looks like no one's home.
Why was the door unlocked?
Wait here.
I kind of feel bad for Pete.
What?
This isn't a good way,
you know.
If you're gonna
get caught cheating,
it shouldn't be like this.
Well, maybe he should've
thought of that
before he was cheating.
Pete!
Stop it.
I coughed.
What do you want from me?
There's nobody up there.
Thank you.


                                    Page 70/112

I guess I was wrong.
I told you.
Can we get out of here,
please?
Yeah, come on. Let's go.
Suck it!
Did you hear that?
What?
I didn't hear anything.
Carlos Delgado.
Excellent choice.
Too bad I got him
three rounds ago.
You're still on the clock.
Oh, shit!
You gotta do something.
We need a name.
Hideki Matsui.
You just took
my whole outfield.
Sorry, Charlie.
What is this?
Debbie.
What the fuck is this?
It's our fantasy baseball draft.
We said no wives.
Your fantasy what?
It's our draft
for fantasy baseball.
I told you all about this.
Got Matsui.
Shit!
Hey, Pete, don't let
the door hit you
in the vagina on the way out!
Come on, who's going?
Prince,
you're on the clock.
I should have told you.
What else have you
been lying about?
Nothing...
That guy said,
""Don't let the door hit you


                                   Page 71/112

in the vagina on the way out.""
Yeah, I heard him.
That was hilarious.
It's just that I know you've
been mad 'cause I've
been working so much,
and I didn't want
to upset you.
I wouldn't be mad.
I don't get mad.
It's a fantasy baseball draft.
I'm not cheating or anything.
No, this is worse.
How is this worse?
This is you wanting
to be with your friends
more than your family.
Look, the reason I make
that up is because if I told
you what I was really doing,
you would just get mad.
So you think I'm seeing
a band, I do my fantasy draft,
and it's win-win.
Well, what'd you do last
Wednesday night when you said
you went to see a band?
I went to the movies.
With who?
By myself.
What'd you see?
Spider-Man 3.
Why do you want
to go by yourself?
Why didn't you ask me to go?
Because I needed
to get away, you know.
With work and you
and the kids, sometimes I just
need some time to myself.
I need time for myself.
I want time for myself, too.
You're not the only one.
It's not that big of a deal.


                                 Page 72/112

I like Spider-Man.
Okay, so let's see
Spider-Man 3 next week.
I don't wanna go see it now.
I don't wanna have
to ask you to ask me.
I want you to just come up
with it on your own.
I don't even know what to say.
What do you want me to do?
You just think because
you don't yell that you're
not mean, but this is mean.
I'm not being mean.
I'm being honest.
You're telling me
I need to be honest.
No, you're not. You're lying.
I'm doing it because I need to
keep my sanity a little bit.
You know what?
I don't want you
at the house anymore, okay?
Come on.
Shit, she's coming back.
How come we go to
the gynecologist so often?
I bet we have to go so much
so we can pay for that
$300,000 machine he has.
I cannot stop thinking
about what an asshole Pete is.
That's a little strong,
I would say.
Really?
'Cause that had to be
one of the most selfish things
I've ever witnessed.
It's understandable,
I would say. I even think
it's kind of funny.
What's funny about it?
Well, you won't laugh now,
I wouldn't imagine,


                                 Page 73/112

but, you know, the situation.
We break into this stranger's house
thinking we're gonna find him
sleeping with a woman,
and it's a bunch of nerds
playing fantasy baseball.
If you saw that, like,
on television, you would laugh.
Is that what you think?
Is that what you wanna do, Ben?
I don't even
like baseball.
I'm just saying,
when you're a guy and,
you know, you have a family,
you have responsibility,
you lose that male camaraderie.
And I get that.
I totally understand
where he's coming from.
Why do guys always go
to that place?
""We miss male camaraderie.""
Why do I give a shit?
Go hang out with your bearded
freak friends. I don't care.
You wanna hang out with guys
that look like the shoe
bomber, it's all on you, man.
What the fuck
am I supposed to say to that?
You should just support me!
You know, you should just
support everything I say
because at this juncture in my life,
I'm allowed to be wrong!
So if you're wrong,
I have to support it?
Yes!
I can't tell you that
you're acting like a lunatic?
No.
No? Okay.
That's helpful.


                                 Page 74/112

You have to do nothing!
I've sacrificed
a lot of shit to do this!
You haven't
sacrificed anything!
I have.
I've had to sacrifice my job,
my body, my youth, my vagina!
You've sacrificed your vagina?
Yes! It will never look
the same after this!
Well. Fine. I'm sorry,
I'll pay for vaginal
reconstructive surgery.
You can't pay for shit!
You can barely buy spaghetti!
You're right! Fine! Okay.
You know what?
Get out of the car.
You know what? How...
Why don't you not threaten me?
You should just get out
of the fucking car.
I'm not gonna get out of the car
in the middle of nowhere! No!
Get out of the car!
No.
I own this car!
Get out of my car!
No.
Get out of my car!
No.
Get out of my fucking car!
Can you let me back
in the car, please?
Have you calmed down?
Did you take a breath?
I have no clue where we are!
Fine. Go.
Great.
Okay.
Maybe I should take
my shoes off. Or my belt
buckle, my belt buckle's huge.


                                   Page 75/112

Don't worry
about gaining weight.
Your baby wants you to gain
a whole mess of weight.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Why don't you take off
your earrings, too?
They weigh about 80 pounds.
They're made out of moon rocks,
aren't they?
Do not make fun of me.
Okay? I am hormonal.
I am terrified,
and I am falling apart,
so stop treating everything
like it's a big joke!
Okay, I'm sorry
you're freaking out,
but I just walked
three fucking miles through
Koreatown to get here!
Sorry if I'm trying
to lighten the mood a little.
Well, don't, okay?
You can't take anything seriously!
You know, you didn't even
read the baby books.
I didn't read the baby book!
What's gonna happen?
How did anyone ever give birth
without a baby book?
That's right. The ancient
Egyptians fucking engraved
What to Expect
When You're Expecting
on the pyramid walls!
I forgot about that!
Who gives a flying fuck
about the baby books?
It just shows your lack
of commitment, Ben!
That you're not in this with me!
Did you just say ""my lack
of commitment""? 'Cause


                                 Page 76/112

that's what it sounded like.
It almost seems as though
you forgot I proposed
to you, like an asshole!
And you said no to me!
If you feel that way,
you should just go.
Really. Just go.
Because we didn't mean
to do this together, okay?
And... And we tried
to make it work
and that was good, I suppose.
But it doesn't work.
Because we are two
completely different people.
And I think it would just be
easier for both of us
if we stop fooling ourselves.
You know, I know
this isn't you talking,
it's your hormones,
but I would just like to say,
fuck you, hormones!
You are a crazy bitch,
hormones.
Not Allison! Hormones!
Fuck them! It's a girl!
Buy some pink shit!
Nice. You are such an asshole.
You know what?
Go fuck your fucking bong, you fuck!
I will fuck my bong.
Doggie style, for once.
Are you ready?
I'm really sorry about all that.
That was really inappropriate.
Oh, no, that's okay.
It happens all the time here.
It's fine.
Oh, good, okay,
I don't feel so stupid, then.
No, no, not at all.
I totally know what


                                 Page 77/112

you're talking about, man.
Like, if I wrote out
the list of shit Allison
doesn't let me do,
like, it would be endless.
""Don't smoke pot. Don't have
samurai swords in your room.
""Don't have illegal grow
operations in the house.""
I mean, like,
I could go on all fucking day.
Have I told her to stop
doing anything ever? No.
Marriage is like that show,
Everybody Loves Raymond,
but it's not funny.
All the problems are the same,
but it's...
You know, instead of
all the funny, pithy dialog,
everybody's just really
pissed off and tense.
Marriage is like an unfunny,
tense version of
Everybody Loves Raymond.
But it doesn't last 22 minutes.
It lasts forever.
Let's get out of here, man.
Honestly, like, let's just go.
Let's go to Vegas.
Let's do it.
Yeah.
Why not?
Get up.
What?
We're not gonna do this.
What?
Seriously.
What are you doing?
We have to go do something
and have fun!
I'm just so tired.
I know you're tired.
But we're gonna be untired!


                                  Page 78/112

We're gonna go live!
I hate you so much sometimes.
We're gonna be positive.
Positive, positive, positive! Up!
How many Red Bulls have you had?
I've had about three Red Bulls
in the last 15 minutes.
And I feel fabulous!
We're gonna create a new life
and it's gonna be awesome!
Get up! Let's go!
Since when do we lock
this fucking thing? Come on!
We can't go, dude. Sorry.
Holy crap! What happened?
We got pink eye.
What, you giving each other
butterfly kisses or something?
Ha, ha, ha. Very funny.
That's not how you get pink eye.
You get it from poo particles
making their way
into your ocular cavities.
Hey, Ben. How's it going?
Yo.
I farted on Jason's pillow
as a practical joke.
He farted on Jonah's,
thinking it was mine,
and then eventually
pink-eyed my pillow.
I'm not proud of any of this,
but I think we've all
forgiven each other.
But we can't go anywhere.
You can get pink eye
from farting in a pillow?
Totally.
Mmm-hmm.
That's awesome!
Yeah, but you got
to be bare-assed.
Jesus, Martin got it bad!
What, did someone take a dump


                                    Page 79/112

right in your eye?
No. No pink eye for me.
I'm just really high.
Well, stay back, guys.
I got to get my suit, okay?
Fuck you.
Are you Debbie's husband?
Yeah.
This is fun!
This is great.
It's just fun, man.
We're gonna have
the best time ever.
We make a good team, man.
Yeah.
It's like, I can't come here
with Debbie.
She wouldn't understand it.
She doesn't understand.
She wants to hold me in,
and she was telling Allison
she could train you.
She thinks she could train me?
Yeah, like you're running
the Triple Crown.
She can't train this!
I'm like Siegfried
and Roy's Bengal.
You think I'm trained. I'II...
I'll bite
your fucking face off!
That's right.
In front of a crowd, baby.
This is better. Besides,
I don't know if I have enough
of these babies to go around.
My God! Are these mushrooms?
Uh-huh. I got them from
a roadie for the Black Crowes.
I'm eating them.
No, no, no. Save it!
I got tickets
to Cirque du Soleil.
You do? No, you don't.


                                 Page 80/112

I swear to God, man.
Holy shit!
See? I see the beam of light.
There it is, baby! Whoo-hoo!
You're so money
that you don't even know
how much money you have.
You're money, baby!
You're money!
I love Vegas, man.
This is the greatest place
on Earth.
It's really amazing here.
You got my tie!
This is awesome!
Now, that's how you get pink eye.
Hey, what's up? Baby girl.
Hi.
What's up?
End of the line, please.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
Look, we're at capacity, okay?
We'll let some people in
when it clears out a little.
You'll get right in if you go
back to the end of the line.
We come here all the time.
It's not a big deal.
It doesn't really look
that crowded in there.
Hey, look.
I don't make the rules.
Please?
No.
Hey, what's up, shorty?
What's up, pretty girls?
See y'all when y'all get out.
Watch yourself.
What was that?
What the fuck was that?
It is what it is, sweetie.
Now can you step


                                    Page 81/112

to the back, please?
You don't need
to call me sweetie.
Maybe we should just go.
Maybe you should
listen to your friend.
No, you don't need
to call me sweetie.
All right, you want to come in,
you're gonna have to go
to the end of the line
and wait like everybody else.
I'm not gonna go to
the end of the fucking line.
Who the fuck are you?
I have just as much of
a right to be here
as any of these
little skanky girls!
What, am I not
skanky enough for you?
You want me to hike up
my fucking skirt?
What the fuck is your problem?
I'm not going anywhere!
You're just some roided out
freak with a fucking clipboard!
And your stupid little fucking
rope! You know what?
You may have power now,
but you're not God!
You're a doorman! Okay?
You're a doorman, doorman,
doorman, doorman, doorman!
So, fuck you, you fucking fag
with your fucking little
faggy gloves.
I know.
You're right. I'm so sorry.
I fucking hate this job.
I don't want to be the one to pass
judgment and decide who gets in.
This shit makes me sick
to my stomach.


                                 Page 82/112

I get the runs from the stress.
It's not 'cause you're not hot.
I would love to tap that ass.
I would tear that ass up.
I can't let you in
'cause you're old as fuck,
for this club,
not, you know, for the Earth.
What?
You old. She pregnant.
Can't have a bunch of old,
pregnant bitches running around.
That's crazy.
I'm only allowed to let in
That mean if there's
I get to let in one-and-a-quarter
black people.
So I got to hope there's a black midget
in the crowd.
Now I feel guilty. I'm sorry.
Why y'all wanna be in here anyway?
Y'all need to be
at a yoga class or something.
What the fuck is she doing at the club?
That's not even
good parenting right there.
Your old ass should know better than that.
Oh, God.
Have the mushrooms
kicked in yet?
This was a great idea, man.
This is the best idea
I've ever had in my life.
What are they gonna do?
What in the world
are they doing?
If I shaved my stomach
and my chest, I would look
exactly like that.
Those guys are
at work right now.
""What'd you do today?""
""I just lifted my brother.""
No. Don't applaud. He'll fall.


                                 Page 83/112

I'm freaking out
right now, man.
The mushrooms are turning on me.
Papa.
I'm not your papa!
Papa!
I can't deal
with this shit, man!
Hold up. Hold up.
Ben, wait. Ben, Ben, Ben, wait!
It's over.
What's over?
My youth.
Oh, don't say that.
It's true.
I just wanna dance.
I love dancing.
So dance.
I can't dance.
I'm embarrassed.
I should be embarrassed.
I'm a fucking whale,
and I'm trying to get
into some stupid club and...
No, you look beautiful.
And you're young
and you're tall,
and you got the good lips
and boobs, and you're young still.
I'm gonna be alone.
Debbie, no, you're not.
Yes, I am.
Oh, God!
Fucking men!
I get worse-Iooking
and he gets better-Iooking,
and it's so fucking unfair.
Oh, fuck.
We should go.
My babysitter always gets mad
when we come home past 12:00.
She's such a pissy
little high-school cunt.
Let's move, gang!


                                 Page 84/112

Come on, come on, come on!
Jessica,
can you get these plates
and put them
on the table, please?
This isn't funny.
That guy has 12 kids.
It's not funny. It's...
Now I get
to start all over again!
This is sick.
This is a sick movie.
That's a lot of responsibility to be
joking about. That's not funny.
I got to turn this off.
It's freaking me out.
There are five different types
of chairs in this hotel room.
Holy fuck. What are they
all doing in here?
These are five
different types of chairs.
Get them out of here, man.
This is too many chairs for one room.
There's a guy that works
for this hotel. His whole job
is to find chairs.
Look at this one. Look at it.
It's gold and red,
and it's kind of shiny.
Shiny thread? Unbelievable.
It is beautiful
and it feels amazing.
The tall one's gawking at me
and the short one's being very droll.
I don't like them.
Oh, wow.
It's weird that chairs even exist
when you're not sitting on them.
I'm up high!
I'm really high up.
I should've read
the baby books.
Why didn't you read


                                 Page 85/112

the baby books?
'Cause then it's real,
you know?
Dude, it's real whether
or not you read those books.
That baby's coming.
Oh, man!
Think they'll take us back?
Yes.
But I don't know why.
Do you ever wonder how somebody
could even like you?
All the time, man. Like every day.
I wonder how you like me.
How can Debbie like me?
She likes me. I mean, she loves me.
The biggest problem
in our marriage is that
she wants me around.
She loves me so much
that she wants me
around all the time.
That's our biggest problem.
And I can't even accept that?
Like that upsets me?
What?
She's the one. She loves me.
You can't believe
people love you?
I love you, man!
Debbie loves you!
I don't think I can accept her love.
There's something wrong with me.
You can't accept love?
I don't know what it is.
Love? The most beautiful,
shiny, warmy thing in the world?
You can't accept it?
I have to go to this other chair.
Oh, this is a better energy.
You can't accept pure love?
You can't accept Debbie?
She's chosen
to give you her life.


                                 Page 86/112

She's picked you
as her life partner!
But you play fantasy baseball
because you can't accept her love?
I could accept it, man.
And Debbie's amazing, man.
She's cool and she's funny
and she smells good
and she's nice and her hair
always looks different.
She's too good for you, man.
Tastes like a rainbow.
You're disgusting.
You know, you're an urchin.
And she busts your balls
'cause you're a little bitch.
You're a filthy bitch!
And I'd bust your balls.
Debbie wants to give her life
to you, and Allison doesn't
want to do that with me.
And it makes me sad all day.
I want to go home.
I wanna go home, too.
Everything looks beautiful.
Thanks.
I went kind of overboard, huh?
No. It's great.
Your daughter only turns eight once.
Is Ben gonna come?
I don't think so.
I don't know why he would.
Oh, hey. What up, dawg?
Where have you been?
Around. You know?
Just kind of doing my thing.
Why is everybody
so mad at you?
I don't know. Are they mad?
What have they been saying?
They've been saying, like,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
""Ben's a prick.""
They said that?


                                 Page 87/112

A lot.
That sucks.
What does it mean?
Penis. It means penis.
Oh.
Penis.
Babe, we're running
low on plates.
Hey, Ben! What's up, man?
What's happening, man?
Hey, Ben.
Hey, Debbie.
How are you?
Good. How are you?
Hi.
Did you just get pink cupcakes
or yellow cupcakes?
I just got yellow cupcakes.
I thought I said
get pink cupcakes.
I can run out.
I'll get some more.
Nah, it's no big deal.
I don't mind.
No, it doesn't matter.
You sure?
Yeah. You look
really cute in that.
All right.
Well, that was fast,
you pussy.
I'm a...
You're the one that got
dressed up like a cholo on
Easter to come to this party.
How are things
at Butt-Fucking-Ham Palace?
You look like Babe Ruth's
gay brother, Gabe Ruth.
Well played, sir. That was good.
You gonna talk to Allison?
Yeah, I was just about to.
Right on.
It's a doll.


                                   Page 88/112

Thanks, Ben.
I just don't think
we can make it work.
We can get back on track,
and everything's gonna be great.
You're just being nice,
and I'm being nice,
and just because we're two
nice people doesn't mean
we should stay together.
I don't want this baby
to determine the rest
of our lives. You know?
Me not wanting to do this alone
isn't enough of a reason
to drag you into a relationship
with me. It's just not fair.
And don't repeat this, but God,
I don't want to end up like Debbie.
But Debbie's happy.
Yeah, she's happy today.
But every day is
a constant struggle for them
because they're not
right for each other.
You know? And they have
to force it, and I don't want
us to have to do that.
I don't want to force you
to be what I think you should be.
That's wrong of me
because you're great.
You really are. You're great
the way you are, and...
I mean, you like to get high,
and you like to do shrooms in Vegas.
I didn't do shrooms in Vegas.
Who am I to stop you?
Who am I to tell you that
that's wrong? It's not wrong.
It's who you are.
It's what you enjoy
and that's your life and...
I'm not that guy anymore.


                                 Page 89/112

I mean, we can be friends.
And you can be there
when the baby is born,
and in the baby's life
as much as you want.
I hope you will be.
I just...
I think that if you just...
I don't know. If you give me a shot
to just show you that I'm...
Excuse me?
Oh, shit.
Can you grab the video camera?
We're gonna sing
Happy Birthday now.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. I got to go.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I'll be right back,
though, all right?
We'll finish talking.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, go.
What happened?
Thanks for warning me, man.
I just walked into a fucking
buzz saw. She rejected me.
'Cause you,
for some insane reason,
told Debbie that I did
mushrooms with you in Vegas!
She gets mad 'cause I smoke pot!
Now I'm upping it to fucking
psychedelics! Thanks!
Really? I thought she'd take you back.
You know why she just rejected me?
'Cause you're such a shitty husband,
she thinks I'm gonna turn
into a shitty husband.
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to you
Jessica! Right here!
Can we get a photo?
When are you due?


                                 Page 90/112

I got two months.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow, you're so big already.
Yeah.
When is that baby popping out?
I got two months to go.
Really? Are you dilated yet?
I can tell.
Wow, wow!
You look fantastic.
You look... Are you gonna,
like, give birth right now?
Wow, you're about
to drop any second.
You know what?
I love your broach.
You don't need to lie to me.
I don't appreciate it.
I know I look like a fat cow.
And I'm sweating profusely.
I know that.
No, no.
No, you don't look like
a fat cow at all. You look great.
So, I have to get going in.
They're calling me.
Steve, hey. Help me out.
Give me an interview, please.
Well, I just need to run in.
You know what? Just say
into the camera, ""You're
watching E! Entertainment. ""
Congratulations.
Just give me that.
No, Steve, don't be
an asshole! Come on.
I'm not being an asshole.
Wow, you managed to turn
Steve Carell into an asshole.
No easy feat.
Shut up, Brent.
You screwed me, Dad, okay?
You said everything was gonna


                                    Page 91/112

be fine and nothing is fine.
Nothing is fine.
Ben, I've been
divorced three times.
Why would you listen to me?
Because you were the only one
giving me advice!
And it was terrible advice!
You can go around blaming everyone
else, but in the end,
until you take responsibility
for yourself, none of this
is gonna work out.
I don't know how to take
responsibility for myself, okay?
I didn't read the baby books!
You didn't read the books?
I just smoke less pot.
I don't know what to do. I'm an idiot!
What... Tell me what to do!
I don't know. I don't know.
Ben, I love you.
What can I tell you?
Just tell me what to do.
Stone, you settling in okay?
Best job I ever had.
Like to hear it.
Allison, thank you
for coming in.
I don't want to shock you
but we know what's under that jacket.
You're pregnant,
have been for a while.
From my count, you're right
around eight months.
And I don't know why you felt
you couldn't tell us.
I'm really sorry.
This is Hollywood.
We don't like liars.
I just...
I wasn't expecting this and...
I didn't know how to handle it,
and I didn't want to lose my job.


                                 Page 92/112

I'm really sorry.
It's unfortunate.
It's unfortunate
you didn't tell us because
you would've found out
that we thought it's great.
Really?
Yeah.
So we did some research.
And turns out,
people like pregnant.
Oh, my God!
The bigger you are,
the bigger your numbers.
I was surprised
'cause I feel the opposite.
We're gonna do a whole maternity
month on E! Mommy.
You're gonna interview
all the pregnant celebs.
Really?
Yes.
Scary!
You're pregnant, they're pregnant,
you can talk about being pregnant.
It just grosses me out when
I know that people are pregnant.
'Cause I think about the birth.
Everything's so wet.
And everything that goes into it.
None of the gross stuff.
But you know, hopes, dreams,
whatever, it's gonna be great.
Oh, my God.
This is such good news.
Thank you so much.
Yeah, you're welcome.
And then,
after the baby is out...
Tight.
...tighten it back up.
And please don't
lie to us again.
Okay.


                                 Page 93/112

'Cause maybe someday
we could be friends.
Okay. I won't. I'm sorry.
I just don't like secrets.
Okay.
You know, it's a rare thing
that you live to see the day
your wildest dreams come true.
I mean, what is there left to want?
I get to go to Legoland.
Shut up, Pete.
Say it!
Legoland!
Legoland!
Legoland!
Don't get them all riled up
before the drive.
I shouldn't have given them
all that meth, then.
We'll be back
on Sunday.
Or Saturday. You never know.
We might see it all in one day.
Sunday. Let's go.
Guess what? I'm scared
there's no one to trust.
You can trust me.
You are gonna
fuck me over, aren't you?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
You are.
Are you retarded? Or just brain-dead
from whiffing fumes out there in the swamp?
Ow, ow, ow.
That's what I am to you, isn't it?
Swamp trash, just like my mom.
Hello?
Hey, what's up, Daddy?
What are you doing?
Just smoking a joint, drinking
some beers, you know. Rocking.
We're about to go
to a new club. You coming?
No. I'm gonna pack


                                 Page 94/112

it in soon, I think.
What's he doing?
He says he's gonna
call it a night.
Dude, it's like 8:15, man.
Yeah, I know. I'm just tired.
Is he depressed?
You depressed?
No, I feel great. I like it.
He says no.
Ask him if he's
gonna kill himself.
You gonna kill yourself?
No, I'm not. Okay? Thank you.
Tell him not to jerk off
with a noose around his neck.
It's dangerous.
You shouldn't jerk off with
a noose around your neck
'cause it's dangerous.
Okay. Very good.
And tell him if he has to,
tell him he needs
a teammate or a spotter there.
Right. And if you do,
you should have
a teammate or a spotter there.
Great.
He says your mom's already there.
Uncool, man.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
Hi, Dr. Howard?
No, this is Dr. Angelo.
How can I help you?
I'm a patient of Dr. Howard's,
and I'm going into labor
and I need to speak with him.
I actually don't know
where he is tonight.
But I've made myself available
to his patients,
and I'd be happy to help you.
Can you help me find him?


                                    Page 95/112

Can you give me his number?
Oh, no. You know what? Actually,
I'm under strict instructions
not to give out his number,
but I can help you through this.
No, no. No, no, no.
I want to speak to my own doctor.
You really won't give me his number?
Because this is my first baby,
and he promised that
he would be here for me
and I need you to give me...
Give me his number, okay?
Dr. Howard's not available tonight.
But everything's gonna be okay,
I assure you.
No, I don't want you to help me
because I have no idea who you are!
I want my own goddamn doctor!
You make sure he calls me!
Oh, shit. Okay.
Oh, shit!
Hello?
Ben, it's me. Can you come?
'Cause the baby's coming.
Can you come?
Oh, God. Allison.
I'm so happy you're calling.
I have so many thing's
I've been wanting to say to you.
I wanna apologize for things.
It's all I can think about.
No, listen. Wait. Listen.
I need you to come help me, okay?
Because the baby's coming.
So can you come help me?
Wait. The baby's coming
right now?
Yes. Right now.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is it happening? It's happening now?
Push. Push...
Breathe like this...
No, no, no, no.


                                 Page 96/112

You need to come now because
the contractions are happening,
and they really hurt
and the doctor isn't here,
and I can't get hold of him.
And he said he was gonna
be here, right? You were there
when he said that.
Okay, okay,
I'll come right now.
Nobody's here.
I'm coming right now.
...not anywhere,
I can't reach them, please.
Please, please hurry.
I'll just... So should I...
I'll meet you
at the hospital, okay?
No! Don't meet me at the
hospital! No, no, I need you
to drive me. I can't drive.
I can't drive like this.
No? You can't drive? Okay.
I'll get gas
and then I'll pick you up.
You have to get gas?
I need to just get cash.
No. Don't get cash. Just come.
I need to get cash because
my car's on empty, I won't
even make it there.
No, just come right now.
I'm not fucking around, okay?
This is serious and I'm alone.
It's the last thing you need to do is...
Just get here!
Look, if you keep yelling
at me, I'm never gonna get there.
You just need to calm down
for two... Okay.
Don't run out of gas.
Don't run out of gas. Come on!
Hello?
Please be in there.


                                 Page 97/112

Hello? Hello? Hello?
Allison?
Hello?
Ben?
Allison.
What is this,
like a water birth?
What are we doing? Should we go?
Should I... I have the...
Shh.
Just relax, okay?
Just be mellow, 'cause
that's what this is all about.
Because if it gets
too stressful in here,
then the baby is born
into a stressful environment,
and then he's wired for stress
for the rest of his life. So just...
Just be calm.
Okay.
Okay, let's relax. Okay.
Do you want
to talk about things?
I feel really bad about, like,
a lot of the shit I did.
I can't believe
I said some of that.
That's all I think about
in my head.
I don't wanna talk about it.
But maybe we could bring
the baby into a reconciled
place so we can talk...
No. I don't wanna go there.
Don't go there. Okay?
Help me stay relaxed.
So, what should I do?
You need to call Dr. Howard.
Hello?
Hello, yes, this is Ben Stone.
I'm calling on behalf of Allison Scott.
We need Dr. Howard.
It's an emergency.


                                 Page 98/112

Yeah. He's at San Francisco
at bar mitzvah.
He's at a bar mitzvah in San Francisco?
Do you know when he gets back?
In three days.
Do you have his cell number,
by any chance?
Hey! Good news.
I got his number right here.
I'm gonna call him right now.
Oh, great. Thank you so much.
Oh, my God. I'm so glad
you're here. Thank you.
I'm glad I'm here, too.
Thank you.
I shouldn't have told you
you were a fucking lunatic.
I shouldn't have said that.
I feel terrible about it and...
No, it's okay.
We're past it. We're past it.
I'm sorry I told you
to fuck your bong.
It's okay. I didn't.
Let's just drop it now.
We're over it.
I'm gonna call him right now.
You're doing so great.
Hello, it's Dr. Howard.
I'm not here right now.
Please leave a message.
Hey, Doc Howard.
Ben Stone calling.
Guess what the fuck's up?
Allison's going into labor
and you are not fucking here.
Now, where are you? You're at
a fucking bar mitzvah in San Francisco,
you motherfucking piece of shit!
And you know
what I'm gonna have to do now?
I'm gonna have to kill you.
I'm gonna have to
pop a fucking cap in your ass.


                                 Page 99/112

You're dead! You're Tupac!
You are fucking Biggie,
you piece of shit!
I hope you fucking die
or drop the fucking chair
and kill that fucking kid!
Hope your plane crashes.
Peace, fucker!
Hey.
Hey.
Did you talk to him?
I didn't talk to him directly.
I left him a very nice message, though.
And... Okay.
What I'm about to tell you
isn't that bad.
You should know that going in.
We can get through this,
and it's just a little hiccough,
but everything will be fine. Okay?
Do you trust me when I say
everything will be fine?
I can deal with it.
Okay.
So, Dr. Howard is at a bar mitzvah.
A bar mitzvah?
It's a Jewish rite of passage.
And he's gonna be there
for the next three days,
so he will not be able
to be here tonight.
Oh, no.
It's okay.
What do you think
we should do?
Okay. I know
exactly what to do.
All we do is we'll get in
the car, I'll drive to the hospital,
and on the way, we will call
every gynecologist we've met.
Someone will be available.
You know?
Okay. I can do that.


                                Page 100/112

Okay. Good.
I mean, we still have time.
I mean, how far apart
are your contractions?
I think, like, seven minutes.
Seven minutes!
See? Not until four minutes
is it really coming.
And has your water broken, even?
I don't know. I'm in the tub.
That's a good point.
Have you had your bloody show?
What? What's that?
It's, it's... I mean, it's
a bloody mucusy discharge.
But it only comes out right before
the baby's gonna come,
so if that hasn't happened,
we have time.
We can make it to the hospital.
It's no problem.
You read the baby books.
Yeah. I did. I read
three of them, actually.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey. Hey, you okay?
Okay.
Wait.
Are we allowed to park here?
It's okay. I stole this
from Martin's grandma.
Oh, that was really
sweet of you.
Thanks.
Okay, here we go. Here we go.
Okay. Inches away.
Okay.
We're close.
Home stretch. Hello.
This is Allison Scott.
Dr. Kuni said he would let you
know we were coming?
Oh, he did.


                                Page 101/112

We'll take good care of you.
Okay.
Samuel?
Yeah?
This is Allison Scott.
Please admit her into Room 307.
Hi.
Hey.
You're our nurse?
That's why I'm holding
the clipboard.
So, what else is up
with you guys?
I'm just joking.
Let's have a baby, huh?
Yeah.
Jeez, I'm sorry it took me so long
to find that vein.
That little guy really
didn't want me to find him.
Is that the baby
on that one right there?
Yeah.
So we can tell how the little
guy or gal is doing.
Okay.
Hello, Allison. Ben.
Interesting night.
We really, really appreciate
you coming, man.
What else do I have to do,
I mean, besides sleep? Totally kidding.
What happened to your doctor?
He's at a bar mitzvah
in San Francisco.
He didn't tell us, though.
Nice.
Yeah.
Lucky for you, I don't have
any Jewish friends.
Dr. Kuni, I really wanna do this
naturally. I don't wanna use drugs.
Okay, let's just take a look
and see what happens, okay?


                                Page 102/112

Foetal heart rate is good.
Samuel, where are we?
Four centimeters.
Four centimeters what?
Dilated?
Dilated. That's right. Focus.
Pay attention, okay?
We're a team. Okay?
I wanna get
the fuck out of here.
What?
I just wanna get
the fuck out of here.
Okay. Just relax,
man, just relax.
Oh, man, I don't fucking
like hospitals.
I know, but, Jonah,
this is beautiful.
I just think you need to relax
and embrace the beauty of
another life joining our gang.
We're having a baby.
We are having a baby.
I'm not having shit besides
a fucking panic attack.
There's probably a fucking room
back there full of dead bodies!
You guys wanna be here
when one rolls out
and just fucking coughs
malaria into our face?
Jesus.
Fucking shit.
Is that good?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, get in there.
I could do this all day.
Cool.
What was that?
What the hell was that?
What's happening?
Well, boys and girls,
what seems to be the problem?


                                  Page 103/112

Decels.
Oh, dear.
Okay, Allison, I need you to
turn on your back now, okay?
The baby's heart rate
is slowing. Okay?
It's gonna be okay.
Okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Is it gonna be fine?
It's gonna be fine. Okay?
You'll feel a little bit of
a push. You'll feel a little bit of...
Oh.
What are you doing?
I'm turning the baby so I can take
the pressure off the cord. Okay?
Oh, my God.
Okay, we're good.
The heartbeat's stronger,
but we're not out of the woods.
We need to get
things going now.
I think the cord is wrapped
around the neck.
So I'm gonna give you
some medicine, pop the bag
and get things going, okay?
I don't wanna leave the baby
in there for long,
and we can give you
some medicine for the pain.
No, no, no, no.
I don't... I don't want the baby to
be born all drugged out.
It's not my birth plan.
Now, things change.
We don't have time to debate this.
What? No. But no, I'm not
comfortable with that. I'm not.
No. Would you please
just listen to her?
Fine. Do what you want to do.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?


                                Page 104/112

Should I leave?
Do you want to be the doctor?
Because I really don't need to be here.
No. What we want is to take
a second to talk
about our options, okay?
That's all we want.
No. You mean you want
to take a second
to tell me how to do my job.
My job is to get
that baby out safely.
Or I can go home.
Just let me know. You be the doctor.
Can we talk outside
in the hall for a second?
That woman is a control freak,
and she needs to let go
and let me do my job.
Look, she's just having
a hard time
because her and our doctor had
a very specific birth plan.
And they wanted it to be
a very special experience.
If you want a special experience,
go to a Jimmy Buffett concert.
We have a new birth plan.
Get the baby out safely.
Look, man, will you help us out?
I have no idea what I'm doing.
You can be as big a dick to me
as you want. Just be nice to her, man.
That's all I ask.
Just please be nice to her.
Are you okay?
I think so.
I'm sorry. Let's start fresh.
Thank you, man. Thanks.
This is healthy. This is good.
I think we're bonding.
Allison, I apologize for being
a little brash, but if you're okay with it,
it's rather important


                                Page 105/112

we break the bag
and give you some medicine
to speed things up.
Because once the bag is broken,
I don't want there to be an infection.
Whatever.
Do what you have to do.
Oh, my God.
What a nightmare that guy is.
I know, I know.
Look, I talked to him.
I think he'll be more cool now.
I'm so sorry
I broke up with you.
You really don't need to be.
And, you know, I knew
you'd give me another shot.
I figured it'd be a lot sooner
than this, you know?
I was just in such
a panic from all of this.
And watching Debbie
and Pete together, it's...
And my ass got so fat.
No, no.
It did.
I just never, for one minute,
thought that the guy
who got me pregnant
would actually be
the right guy for me.
Me, either.
I guess he is.
Yeah.
All right, Martin, who am I?
""People
think I'm smart because
I speak in a robot voice.""
Stephen Hawking.
""I fuck my nurse
with my ever-expanding cock.""
All right.
Let's murderball.
Come here!


                                Page 106/112

I'm gonna murderball you!
Stay down!
Jonah, you shithead!
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
I can't believe I go
out of town and this happens.
I know.
I'm sorry,
but I'm not going anywhere.
Screw Legoland.
All right.
Hey, how do you want this?
You want this over the shoulder?
You know, I can do whatever
you want. I can get in there.
Kind of Spike Lee angles.
No, you can shoot the waiting
room. That would be great.
Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you.
I've got it from here.
Debbie.
Can I talk to you
in the hall for a second?
Why?
I'd like to be in there
with Allison, without you.
Okay.
I understand how you feel
but this isn't up to you.
Look, Debbie, you are high
off your ass if you think
you're coming into that room.
If you take one step towards
that door, I will tell security
there's a crazy chick in a pink
dress snatching up babies. Okay?
So don't even try to come into
that room. That's my room now.
That little area with the Pepsi
machine, that's your area.
My room. Your area. Stay in your area.
Stay out of my room.


                                Page 107/112

Back the fuck off.
What are you doing here?
He just kicked me out.
He told me to leave.
Oh.
But I guess it's good, right?
He said he's gonna
take care of her.
He really seems on his game.
I think he's gonna be a good dad.
I think I like him.
Thank God.
I wish I'd gotten
that on tape.
Go! Holy shit, almighty!
Oh, shit, this really hurts!
I see we're well on our way.
Okay.
I want the...
I want the epidural. Okay?
Give me the epidural!
Give her the epidural, okay?
Give it to her now.

KUNl:
We're past the point of an epidural.
Okay? The cervix is fully dilated.
No, seriously,
I want an epidural!
I know there's time!
We can't give you
the epidural.
Take the time! I...
I'll make sure it doesn't come out!
I'll stop pushing.
We have time.
Just do it, please!
I'll stop.
Please, please, please!
I'm sorry. We have no time.
We're gonna just have to do
this the all-natural way, okay?
The way you wanted to do it.
Okay? Ready?


                                Page 108/112

Okay.
Here comes another contraction, okay?
I want you to push. Okay, ready?
Good, good, good.
I feel everything!
Oh, my God! It's happening!
Okay, maybe we can
take it down just a little.
I think you're gonna scare
the other pregnant women.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Okay.
Are you kidding me?
Jesus.
This is messed up.
Something's wrong in there.
Yeah.
Oh, no, no.
I mean, granted, gynecology's
only a hobby of mine,
but it sounds to me like she's
crowning. Is that right, Deb?
Yeah. That's what it sounds
like for everyone.
Everyone goes through this.
No, I disagree with you.
That sounds terrible.
I'm gonna go sneak a peak,
see if there's anything I can do.
Okay! It's crowning!
I'm seeing the head!
Oh, God.
What does it look like, Ben?
Oh, God.
What?
You don't wanna see it.
No, I wanna see it!
It's beautiful.
You don't want to, though.
No, I want to see it!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Okay, we're almost home!
One, two...
You okay in here? Jesus!


                                Page 109/112

Get out!
Yeah, okay.
Oh, no!
You all right, buddy?
It's okay.
What did it look like?
I shouldn't have gone in there.
Don't go in there.
Promise me you don't go in there.
Me, go in there? That's the last
fucking place I wanna go.
Like I'm gonna go in there.
Try getting a boner now.
What's up, Deb?
Hey.
Push. One, two, three.
Oh, God!
You've passed the shoulders.
One more big push.
Good.
I did it.
Okay. Oh, my God. It's out.
You did it. You did it.
Oh, my God, you did it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
I love you, Ben.
I love you so much, too.
Oh, my God.
Congratulations, you two.
Beautiful.
Thank you.
You did so great.
You were amazing.
Thank you.
Okay, pretty baby.
You got out.
You made it out. Welcome.
You ever get so bored
you just stare at your balls?
I bet you do, late John Lennon.
Here we are again.
Who is that?
Is that Ben's rabbi?


                                Page 110/112

Is he the one
who cuts the penis?
I think it's Matisyahu.
Awesome.
You want out of the bet?
I want out of the bet.
You know what you have to say.
Just say it, man.
I think now is the time.
Jason, you're the master.
You heard it, right?
Yeah.
All right. You're out of the bet.
Yeah, now you're done.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, God.
Your face smells
like an old man's balls.
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, fucking hell.
Hey.
Oh, my God.
Oh, hello.
Oh, my goodness.
She's beautiful.
Hello.
Oh. I love you, Ben.
I love you, Debbie.
We're gonna have another baby.
Okay.
Hello, baby.
Gentlemen, it's a girl!
We got a daughter!
Mazel tov!
Congratulations, Daddy!
We got
a beautiful little girl!
Let's meet her! She's awesome!
A beautiful little girl!
And then your mommy said,
""Just do it, already,""
which was very confusing
to Daddy.
So I listened to the most


                                Page 111/112

literal translation of that
and I just did it, already.
What would you do?
Don't tell Mommy,
but it was the smartest thing
I ever did, listening to her,
'cause now you're here.
Isn't that nice?
I think it is.
Hi, you.
I hope your apartment is big enough
for the three of us.
Oh, it definitely is.
That's why I got one in East LA,
the rent. It's huge!
The only thing is
we have to decide
if we're gonna be Crips
or Bloods before we get there.
Well, I look good in red.
I look good in blue.
The fighting continues.
We could just throw off everyone
and become Latin Kings.
Yeah.
We both look good in gold.
Yeah.
Good choice.
I would yell at you about driving
so slow, except the baby's here.
No, these guys can honk all they want.
I ain't going faster than 12.
It might take us around three
hours to get home, though.

              but I don't see that - seems to me that
              love is everywhere. Often it's not
              particularly  dignified,      or newsworthy - but
              it's always there - fathers & sons, mothers
              & daughters,  husbands & wives, friends &
              strangers.   When the planes hit the Twin
              Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone
              calls from the people about to die were
              messages of hate and revenge - they were
              all messages of love. If you look for it,
              I've got a nasty suspicion you'll find that

                 I'm confident    she expected me to ignore.
                 But others she was pretty damn clear about.
                 When she first mentioned what's about to
                 happen, I said 'Over my dead body' and she
                 said ""No, Danny - over mine."" And, as
                 usual, my darling girl,      and Sam's darling
                 Mumwas right - 100%. So she's going to say
                 her final farewell to you, not through me -
                 but, inevitably,    ever-so-coolly,   through
                 the inunortal genius of the Bay City

                 Hello.   What the hell   are you doing here?
                               CHRIS
                 o, I just    popped over to borrow some old
                 CDs.
                               JAMIE
                 Did the lady of the house let       you in?

                 Lovely obliging gi-gi-girl.      Just thought
                 I'd pop back before the reception,      see if
                 she was feeling better.     Look, I was
                 thinking that maybe we should take Mum out
                 for her birthday on Friday - what do you
                 think? I feel we've been bad sons this
                 year.
                                CHRIS
                 Okay, that    sounds fine - bit    boring    but
                 fine.
    THERE'S A CALL FROMOFF.

                 This is a bit odd, actually.   My girlfriend
                 doesn't know I'm here - and she calls you
                 'Chris' - not 'da-da-darling'   - unless she
                 calls you... 'darling' when I'm not here - in
                 which case the reason you're here is
                 probably less to do with borrowing, let's
                 say, an old Paul Simon album and more to do
                 with, let's   say, you having sex with my
                 girlfriend   when I'm out.
                              CHRIS

                  Well, you could say 'it's   not true - I AM
                  here because I had a passionate    craving for
                  the music of Art Ga-ga-garfunkel's     best
                  friend.'
                              GIRL (V/O)
                  Forget the tea, babe - I've located a
                  packet of 3 - if you get a move on we can
                  finish them off by the time old pencil-dick
                  comes home.

                  girls.    So I should just go to America - I'd
                  get a girlfriend      there instantly. What do

                  same the world over - wherever you go,
                  you'll  still   be dull and ugly - and girls

                   so we don't recognise them. They probably
                   just look normal like you or me - but still
                   cunningly wander around doing good.

                   In our play they don't do any good at all -
                   they just stand there looking like poofs
                   and saying 'Isn't   Baby Jesus great' when
                   everyone knows he's just a stupid doll. I.
                   want to be a lobster.   (HE ·wALKSOFF) And,

                     conversation the fact that you'd like to
                     marry him and have lots of sex and babies.

                  So if you believe in Father Christmas,
                  children - like your Uncle Billy does - buy
                  my cunting record - and particularly   enjoy

                  we try to squeeze in an extra syllable   into

                  I think you're referring   to ""If you really

                   she did, she'd despise me. She's 2 years

                   There is a very strong feeling in the
                   party, and indeed, in the country, that we
                   mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied from
                   pillar to post like the last government.

                  Of course we'll try to be clever, but let's
                  not forget, we're a very small country, one
                  of many, and America is the most powerful
                  country in the world. We're lucky to be

                                  PRESIDENT
                    Very satisfactory   indeed - we got what we
                    came for - the special relationship   is
                    still very special.

                    Prime Minister?
     PAUSE.
                                      PM
                    Love that word 'relationship        - covers all
                    manner of sins doesn't it? I greeted the
                    President       knowing there couldn't   be
                    equality      with America - but I wasn't
                    prepared for a total lack of give and take.
                    I fear this has become a bad relationship
                    - a relationship       based on the President
                    taking exactly what he wants - and casually
                    ignoring those things that really matter
                    to ... Britain.    We may be a small country but
                    we're a great country too, and a friend who
                    bullies      us is no longer a friend.    And since
                    bullies      only respond to strength - from
                    this moment on, I will be more prepared to
                    be less friendly.       And the President   should
                    be prepared for that.

                               HEADMISTRESS
                  One rather strange incident.  Mother came in
                  - her son had written a really shocking
                  essay - and she took the boy outside - and
                  left me & Mr Trench waiting   like a pair of
                  spare parts for 10 minutes before we
                  realised  they'd quite simply buggered off.

                  How splendid. Teach you to be so pompous -
                  I bet the essay was excellent.
                               HEADMISTRESS
                  Well, actually to be honest, it did have
                  its amusing side. His Christmas wish was to
                  see people's farts.
                               GERALDINE

                  they're not all fancy are they - pork and
                  leek and apple and all that shit?
                               HEADMISTRESS
                  Absolutely not. (?AUSE) All right, I'll

                        thought maybe if I was in the band and
                        played absolutely superbly,   then there's a

                     Well, this must be a very exciting moment
                     for you - fighting  for the Christmas Number
                     1. How is it looking so far?

                     Very bad indeed. Westlife are outselling  me
                     five to one. But I'm hoping for a last
                     minute surge. And in fact, if I do reach
                     the top, I promise that I'll  sing the song
                     stark naked on tv on Christmas Eve.

                    hope that you will give me your permission.

                   Thank you very much. Before we finish,    I'd
                   just like to say to our headmistress   Mrs
                   Monroe, on behalf of all the parents,   that
                   we think it's very brave her being here
                   today - in the light of her recent loss.

                   Beautiful Aurelia - I've come here with a
                   view to asking you ... to marriage me.
      CUT TO HER.
                                JAMIE (CONT'D)
                   I know I seems an insane person - because I
                   hardly know you - but sometimes things are
                   so transparency,   they don't need evidential
                   proof. I'd be very honoured if you would
                   make marriage with me, and I will habit
                   here, or you can come and habit with me in
                   England ..
                                 SOPHIA
                   Definitely   go for England, girl. You might
                   meet Prince William    - then you can marry
                   him instead.

                                      expect you to be as
                   foolish as me, and of co-co-course I
                   prediction you say 'no' - but it's

                   What the hell are you doing here? You're
                   meant to be at Elton John's.
                               BILLY
                   Yes - I was there for a minute or two - and
                   then I had an epiphany.
                              JOE
                   Really. Come in. And what was this
                   epiphany?

                   It was about Christmas.
                                  JOE
                   You realised    that   it was all   around.
                                 BILLY
                   No, I realised   that Christmas      is a time to
                   be with the people you love.
                                  JOE
                   Right.
                                  BILLY
                   And I realised     that - as dire chance and
                   fateful    cock-up would have it - here I am,
                   mid-fifties     and without knowing it, I've
                   gone and spent most of my adult life with a
                   chubby employee. And as much as it grieves
                   me to say it, it might be that the people I
                   love is, in fact, you.
                                  JOE
                   Well, this     is a surprise.

I have a dream
A song to sing
To help me cope
With anything
If you see the wonder
Of a fairy tale
You can take the future
Even if you fail

                                      Lisa: (Offstage) Sophie!

                                 (Ali and Lisa climb over the wall.)

                                              Ali: Sophie! Ahhh!
                                                    Lisa: Hi!
              Sophie: Ali, Lisa, where have you been? I thought you'd get here hours ago.
                   Ali: What a journey! Guess who left their ticket on the kitchen table.
        Lisa: We said ""We have to get on this plane - it's our best friend's wedding tomorrow.""
                                                 Sophie: Lisa!
                                                 Lisa: Sophie!
              Ali: We made such a fuss. ....We were in that plane even without the ticket!
                     Lisa: So where is he then. Your Sky? We are dying to meet him.
                Ali: How's your mum? I bet Donna's been going nuts over this wedding.
              Sophie: Yeah, well listen I've got a secret and you're the only ones I can tell.
                                     Lisa: Oh my god! You're pregnant.
                              Sophie: No! I'm inviting my Dad to my wedding.
                                               Ali: Your Dad?
                                 Lisa: You mean you've found him at last?
            Sophie: Not exactly! Look I found this in Mum's desk. (She shows them a diary)
                Ali: Sophie, you're not supposed to go around reading your Mum's diary!
                           Lisa: No! She's supposed to go around reading yours.
   Sophie: But Look! 1979, the one she kept the year she fell pregnant with me. You know how she
 won't talk about my Dad, says she cant remember. Huh! (Reading from the diary) July 17th.What a
night. After the show Sam rode me over to the little island. We danced on the beach and kissed on the
                                            beach and dot dot dot
                                                  Ali: What?

              Sophie: (Reading) ""Sam's the one, I know he is. I've never felt this before.""

                                   Lisa: So this guy Sam's your dad?
             Sophie: The plot thickens. Sam told Mum he was going home to get married.
                                               Lisa: Bastard!
                                         Ali: Typical bloody man.
 Sophie: I know. August 4th...What a night! I was still feeling depressed about Sam When after the
show 'Bill' rented a motorboat and I took him over to the little island. One thing led to another and...
                                                dot dot dot.
                                                Ali/Lisa: Bill!
 Sophie: August 15th. What a night! Harry turns up out of the blue so I said I'd show him the little
        island. I must need my head examined. But he was so sweet I couldn't help it and....
                                             All: Dot Dot Dot!
           Sophie: Yes! The sperm donor has a name, well three names! Sam, Bill or Harry.
                             Ali: And they're all arriving for the wedding?
                                               Sophie: Yes!
                                    Lisa: Oh my god! Do they know?
Sophie: What do you write to a total stranger? Come to my wedding you might be my dad. No! They
    think Mum sent the invitations - and after what's in here I'm not surprised they all said yes.

                                          All: Honey Honey
                                  Touch me baby aha honey honey

                              Ali: Aww! Well let's hope it's a wide aisle.
          Sophie: You've got to keep mum out the way she mustn't know what I'm doing?
                         Ali: Well she's bound to see them sooner or later.
Sophie: I'm not having Mum frightening them off before I've got to know them. And with any luck I'll
                                      know my Dad straight away.
                                   Lisa: Yeah! And what if you don't?
                             Sophie: Then I've got 24 hours to find out!

          Donna: Oh all the better for seeing you pair. God Tanya! Eight bloody years!
            Tanya: I know darling. Blame it on a penchant for jet setting millionaires.
     Donna: Well, I've been chained to this place and constant battles with the bank manager.
                            Rosie: Well I pity the poor bank manager!

                                          (Sophie Enters)

                              Rosie: You've not been here long have you?
      Sky: No. I came here to escape from the London Stock exchange and never went back.
                                               Rosie: Why?
            Sky: I'd burnt out. I'd been dealing in the world but never seen it you know
          Donna: But you should see what he's done to my world. He's gotten me online!
                                                Rosie: You!
                               Donna: Email, wired up, knuckled down.
     Sky: You've got to move with the times, Donna. No more Drachmas under the mattress.
                  Donna: Yeah, well just invent me a machine that'll make the beds
                Sophie: You'd still run along behind it and do it all again I know you.
     Donna: Are you joking? I'm more than ready to put my feet up when the boat comes in.
          Rosie: Talking of boats, I'd sink that old wreck you've got moored by the jetty.
                                               Sky: Sink it?!
                                  Rosie: Well it's a bit of an eyesore!
                      Donna: Well that eyesore's going to be my floating casino.
                                              Tanya: What?
                Donna: Sky and Eddie are transforming it into a millionaire' paradise.
                      Sky: Sailing round the islands gambling under then stars!
    Rosie:Aye! Gambling millionaires! There might be a few of your ex-husbands aboard Tanya.
                    Tanya: don't think so darling. Didn't leave them their millions.
 Donna: Well this is going to be my jackpot girls. I need a break. I mean a holiday. I've been running

this place for fifteen years and I've never had a day off.

                                               Boat Dock



                                (Bill Sam and Harry enter with luggage)

                                    Harry: I'm glad to get off that boat!
               Bill: Ah that was nothing! You should try a kayak in the Okanama swaps.
                   Harry: Oh yes! I read your book, "" A Bloke in a Boat in Botswana!""
                             Bill: Thanks I heard I'd sold a copy somewhere.
   Harry: Travel books are my passion, a distraction from the horrors of the London Underground.
         Sam: Do you two want to hear something really interesting. Do you see this taverna?
 Harry: I'm rather impressed. I remembered an old hut here. I was dreading bedding down with the
                                                   goats.
 Bill: Oh, give me goats over camels. There was this time in the Kalahari when the sun was beating
                                              down and we...
 Sam: All right! All right! Sorry to spoil the travel log, Indiana! The point is that this is my taverna, I
built this. Well, no no! I designed it. I drew up the plans, what it must be 21 years ago. I cant believe
                              she's actually gone and built the bloody thing.
                                                Harry: Who?
  Sam: Well Donna. Who else? Yeah. This is just something I scribbled down on the back of an old
                                      menu. I'd no idea she would...
                                     Bill: How do you know it's yours?
                       Sam: Buildings are like babies. You always know your own.
  Bill: Well I don't know anything about babies. I've been living out of a rucksack most of my life.
                                     Sam: Aha!A happy wanderer, eh?
                        Harry: Do you think the island would inspire some prose?
   Bill: I hope so... When I go back I want to sell my editor a piece on childhood haunts revisited.

                                       Harry: Were you born here?
Bill: No. I was born and raised in Merthyr Tidville. But my mother's Greek. And about the only time I
            was in Greece was to visit my great aunt and that was... twenty-one years ago.
             Harry: So now you can write about Sam's taverna, and the tourist will flock...
        Bill: No I think this place should always be the secret idyll that I always remembered.
Sam: Well if you were born here, maybe the idyll would be boatloads of tourists with pockets full of
                                                 money!
              Harry: Well at least they might have some staff then. Where is everybody?

                                           (Sophie enters)

                                                   Harry: Oh...
                                 Sophie: Good afternoon. Can I help you?
                               Bill: I'm Bill Austin. You have a room for me.
                                   Sophie: (pauses, flustered) Bill Austin?
                                       Harry: I'm Bright. Harry Bright.
                  Sophie: (even more flustered) Harry!... (to Sam).. So you must be...
                        Sam: Sam Carmichael, yeah... Er, you were expecting us?
                      Sophie: Yes. Yes, of course. (Nervous laugh) I'll get the keys.
              Harry: Well I hope I get the chance to get my tongue around a little Greek.
                                                 Sam: Oh yeah?
                             Harry: I haven't spoken it for twenty-one years.
 Sam: Hang on, hang on! Twenty-one years? You know, this is beginning to sound a bit like a set up.
  Well, now, Bill, here's a story for you. Friends, 3 men, strangers receive an invitation to a wedding.
   They're invited to a place they haven't visited for 21 years, by a woman they haven't seen for 21
                                          years. Why are they here?
  Bill: (Making notes) That's not bad! Hey, Harry what's your excuse? What's torn you away from the
                                                Bank of England?
 Harry: Is this an interview? Well for me Donna's invitation brought back many happy memories. (He
                              sees an old Guitar on the wall) Gordon Bennet!
                                  Bill: (Still taking notes) Is that a quote?
Harry: I know this guitar! Ha! (Reading off the guitar) H.B. ""Head Banger"". That's what they called me
in those days! (He demonstrates why then continues to read) And D.S. Donna Sheridan. I bought this
 for her. Ten quid and my Johnny Rotten T-Shirt! So now who says I'm an unadventurous old stick in
                                                    the mud!
                                              Sam: Who says that?
 Harry: My other half. Perhaps a fast car and a season ticket to Chelsea isn't enough for some people.
They want the great white hunter too. Well, I can do spontaneity. Alright, that's why I'm here. Donna
knew my wild side. I was on my sixth form trip to Paris. And I just followed her to Greece (He strums
                       the guitar) Spontaneously! Hang on! (Remembering a tune)

                                      ""Thank You For The Music""

                                               Harry:
                            Thank you for the music the songs I'm singing

                                      We used to sing this one.

                                 Thanks for all the joy their brining
                              Who can live without it I ask in all honesty
                                         What would life be

                                     (Sophie enters and joins in)

                        So I say thank you for the music - for giving it to me.

                                        Harry: You're Donna's daughter.
                                                 Sophie: Yeah.
                                            Harry: Well I never did.
                            Bill: I thought she looked familiar. So you're Sophia.
                                            Sophie: It's jut Sophie.
                           Bill: Well Sophie's pretty. I had a great aunt Sophia!
                                       Sophie: I'm named after a Sophia.
             Harry: Where's Donna?I wanna see her. I wanna thank her for the invitation.
                               Harry: Yes it's very kind of her to remember us.
        Sophie: No, no you mustn't. You're a secret. I sent the invitations. She doesn't know.
                                                   Bill: Why?
Sophie: Because....Mum's always talking about her friends from the old days and I thought she'd just
  be thrilled if I invited you all. But then ...she's got herself in such a state about this wedding, and
                           she's not expecting guests, and she'll hyper ventilate.
      Sam: Sophie, so she's...Hold on here. Are you trying to tell us that Donna didn't invite us.
 Sophie: NO! So just pretend you're here for a holiday and she'll get a lovely surprise when she sees
                   you all at my wedding. (nervous laugh) we'll let her in on the secret.
                                              Sam: Yes, er , but..

                                    Sophie: (picks up the song)
                           Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk,

                               Sam: Oh boy have you made a mistake!

                      Sophie: She says I began to sing long before I could talk
                            And I've often wondered how did it all start
                         Who found out that nothing could capture a heart
                                         Like a melody can
                                   Well whoever it was I'm a fan
                                           Sophie/Harry:
                                              So I say
                          Thank you for the music the songs I'm singing
                                 Thanks for all the joy their brining
                                         Sophie/Harry/Bill:
                                      Who can live without it

                                         Sam: Oh Bloody Hell!

                                          Sophie/Harry/Bill:
                                         I ask in all honesty
                                         What would life be
                                Without a song or dance what are we
                                 So I say Thank you for the music
                                         For giving it to me

Sam: Look, Sophie! I don't want to spoil the surprise but last time I saw your mother she told me she
     never wanted to see me again. So if it was you that sent me the invitation I'm still barred.
                        Sophie: But that was years ago. And I want you here.
                                             Sam: Why?
            Sophie: Because...it's my wedding and I just want everyone to be friends.
Sam: Oh! You are a little minx you're worse than your mother. I'm glad you never met my boys you'd
                                              ruin them!

            Sophie: Your boys? You have sons?
Sam: Yes! I've got two. I'd love to bring them here someday
       Sophie: Like you used to bring my mother.

           (Sam gives Sophie a questioning look)

                 Sophie: I've been so lucky
               I am the girl with golden hair
             I wanna sing it out to everybody
           What a joy what a life what a chance
                     Sophie/Harry/Bill:
       Thank you for the music the songs I'm singing
             Thanks for all the joy their brining
                  Who can live without it
                    I ask in all honesty
                    What would life be
           Without a song or dance what are we
                  Sophie/Harry/Bill/Sam:
             So I say Thank you for the music
                    For giving it to me
             So I say Thank you for the music
                Sophie: For Giving It To Me.

    Harry: Would there be a trouser press on the island?
          Sophie: I'll take you to your rooms now.

                   (Donna Enters Singing)

     Donna: There was something in the air that night
             The stars were bright Fernando

                       Bill: Donna?
Donna: They were shining there for you...(She sees Bill) Bill?
                    Harry: Hi Donna!
                      Donna: Harry!
                        Sam: Hi!
                       Donna: You!

                       ""Mamma Mia!""

                           Donna:
      I was cheated by you and I think you know when
       So I made up my mind it must come to an end
             Look at me now - will I ever learn?
                      I don't know how
                 But I suddenly lose control
               There's a fire within my soul.

                         Company:
          Just one look and I can hear a bell ring.
          One more look and I forget everything.
                         Oh oh oh

                Mamma mia, here I go again.

                                   My, my, how can I resist ya?
                                Mamma mia, does it show again?
                              My, my, just how much I've missed ya?
                                              Donna:
                                  Yes I've been broken hearted
                                  Blue since the day we parted.
                                 Why, why did I ever let you go?

                                            Company:
                                 Mamma mia, now I really know
                               My, my, I should not have let you go!

                                       I was angry and sad
                                  When I knew we were through,
                                    I can't count all the times
                                      I have cried over you.

                                                Donna:
                                          Look at me now,
                                          Will I ever learn?
                                         I don't know how,
                                    But I suddenly lose control.
                                   There's a fire within my soul.
                              Just one look and I can hear a bell ring

                                           Oh oh oh oh

              (Donna falls in Sam's, Harry's and Bill's hut while Company looks down.)

                                  Mamma mia. Here I go again
                                  My my, how can I resist ya?
                                Mamma mia. Does it show again,
                              My my, just how much I've missed ya?

                                             Donna:
                                  Yes I've been broken hearted
                                 Blue, since the day we parted.
                                Why, why did I ever let you go?
                                 Mamma mia, now I really know
                               My my I should not have let you go.

                          Sam:You always knew how to make an entrance.
                           I am dreaming, aren't I? You're not really here!
                                 Sam: Would you like me to kiss you?
                              Donna: You keep your hands to yourself!
                                   Sam: You've changed your tune!
Donna: Well what the hell are you doing here, Sam? Why are any of you here? Sorry, I'm just amazed
                                             to see you all!
                            Bill: Well I'm doing an article for a magazine.
                                   Harry: And I'm here for a holiday.
                             Sam: And I thought I'd just drop in - say Hi
               Donna: Shame! We don't have any rooms - it's that time of the year

                                  Sam: Just as well I booked ahead!
                                  Donna: Well this is so inconvenient!
                                                Bill: Why?
Donna: Because... because...one of the local girls is getting married tomorrow. And I just don't have
       the staff to cope with you all. You'd be so much more comfortable on the mainland.
Sam: Oh no, no. Not at all. Bill here's used to roughing it for his art. And old head-banger over there
                                    is the last word in spontaneous!
                                        Donna: What about you?
                      Sam: Me? Well, I came back to see the island and um....
 Donna: Yeah well. I'd love to stop and chat and er..chew over old times but I have to go and ..er...
                                 clean out my handbag or something!

                                            (Donna Exits).

                                     Bill: Age does not wither her
                            Harry: I was expecting a rather stout matron
                                     Sam: No - she still's Donna

                                           Act I, Scene 4
                                      Tanya's and Rosie's Room

Scene 2: Tanya and Rosie's Room. Rosie and Tanya are standing at the foot of the ONLY bed. Rosie is
    tossing a coin and Tanya looking on expectantly. The coin lands, Rosie celebrates, picks up an
  inflatable mattress and throws it to Tanya who, with a look of thunder, begins to blow it up. Rosie
                  comically begins to unpack whilst Tanya gets very red in the face.

                                          Rosie: Go on girl, suck!
                       Tanya: Let's see what you're wearing for the wedding then.
                           Rosie: (sings and show camouflage shorts) Dah dah!
                                          Tanya: You are Joking!
                                        Rosie: What? Go on! Say it!
                                                Tanya: Well!
                                                 Rosie: Yeh?
         Tanya: You could have been making some sort of statement on the duty of wedlock
                      Rosie: (Chuckles) Well you'd know more about that than me..
                              Tanya: Oh darling, you'll meet your Mr. Right.
  Rosie: Oh I have. I do. And all they wanna do is settle down and have babies. Urrrghh. No thanks!
Tanya: No. Children can become such subversive little sods. I mean, who'd have thought that Donna -
            an icon of female independence - would have a daughter getting spliced at 20!
                              Rosie: Yeah well, white weddings are trendy!
 Tanya: What's wrong with these kids? Do you remember those t-shirts we used to wear? 'Marriage is
                                                     an
                                    Tanya/Rosie: institution for people
                                   Rosie: who belong in an institution!'
       Tanya: Girls today seem to think that a woman's greatest achievement is getting a man!
                                    Rosie: You've had three husbands!
                                          Tanya: I rest my case!
 Rosie: (Pulls trunk out from under the bed) Oh look (Screams! She pulls out the old 'routine poster)
                                           Oh my God! Oh! Oh!
                                    Tanya: Oh! Oh! We were so young!
      Rosie: I don't know what the girls in my new woman bookshop would say about the outfit.
                     Tanya: Rosie, we should do a number tonight for the hen party
        Rosie: (Pulling the old outfits out of the trunk) Blimey! I'd have to let out those seams!

                                      Donna enters in a state.

                                      Donna: Where's Sophie?
                                   Rosie: I haven't seen her why?
                                    Donna: I must find her now.
                               Tanya: (Presenting the poster) Da Da!
                               Donna: Oh my god! That's all I want!
                                     Tanya: It was in the trunk.
         Rosie: You should hang that in the bar. Show Sophie what a funky mum she's got
         Donna: No. Give it here (screws it up angrily) Burn it! I never want to see it again!
                                         Rosie: What's up?
                                     Tanya: What's happened?
    Donna: This has to be a joke. Any minute I'm gonna wake up and they'll have all gone away.
                    (Donna dives into the bed and buries her face in the pillow)
                                         Tanya: What is it?
 Donna: Nothing! Leave me alone. I cant talk about it. I knew this would happen! All my life it's just
been tapping me on my shoulder. Of course it was gonna come out now. It had to. Oh God, why was I
                                      such a stupid little idiot?

                                             ""Chiquitita""

                              Rosie: Chiquitita, tell me whats wrong?
                              Tanya: I have never seen such sorrow.
                      Rosie/Tanya: In your eyes, and the wedding is tomorrow
                              Tanya: How I hate to see you like this...
                              Rosie: There is no way you can deny it..
                           Tanya: I can see that you're oh so sad so quiet
                             Rosie/Tanya: Chiquitita, tell me the truth
                                   I'm a shoulder you can cry on
                                          Your best friend.
                                   I'm the one you must rely on.
                                  You were always sure of yourself
                                 Now I see you've broken a feather
                                I hope we can patch it up together.

                                    Chiquitita, you and I know
                               How the heartaches come and they go
                                   And the scars they're leaving
                                   You'll be dancing once again
                                       And the pain will end
                                 You will have no time for grieving

                                      Chiquitita, you and I cry
                                    But the sun is still in the sky
                                       And shining above you
                                  Let me hear you sing once more
                                         Like you did before
                                          Sing a new song
                                              Chiquitita.
                                      Donna: Try once more,
                                           Like I did before
                                        Sing a new song.....

                                         Donna: It's her Dad!
                                          Rosie: Who's Dad?
 Donna: Sophie's! You know how I always said that it was Sam, the architect who ran home to get
                                                married.
                                      Rosie: Typical bloody man!
    Donna: Well, I'm not really sure that it was him... You see... there were a couple of others!
                              Tanya: Donna Sheridan! You dark horse!
                                 Rosie: Hey? Why didn't you tell us?
Donna: I didn't think I'd ever have to. I didn't think that all three would be sitting in my bar the day
                                   before their daughter's wedding!
    Rosie: (shocked) What? In the bar? Let me see them. I can't see anyone. Where are they?
                                    Tanya: Donna...are you sure?
  Donna: Of course I'm sure! You think I'd forget my daughter's dads? Sam, Bill Austin and Harry
   Headbanger - ye gods - why have they all turned up now? It's like some horrible trick of fate!
                             Rosie: (dramatically) Gods!It is very Greek!
                                        Tanya: Do they know?
       Donna: No I never told anyone? I mean, why are they here ruining Sophie's wedding?
                        Rosie: I thought you weren't keen on this wedding...
Donna: I won't let them spoil things. They have no right to turn up like this. I mean, what have they
                                    ever done for their daughter?
                     Rosie: Donna! Be fair! They didn't even know she existed!
  Donna: They don't need to know. I've done a bloody good job of raising Sophie all by myself and
                         now...I'm gonna be muscled out by an ejaculation!
Rosie: No! Look tonight's a male free zone at the hen night and then tomorrow Tanya and I will take
                                             them fishing.
                                      Tanya: Fishing! Oh please!
                  Rosie: Oh, and what else do you suggest we do with three men?
                                Tanya: Now that does take me back.
 Rosie: You dumb bat! You should have told us! I remember Bill Austin. He was a bit of all right eh?
                                              Wasn't he?

                             (Donna and Tanya share a look and laugh)

Donna: Oh it's just a laugh a minute to you two but I'm the one who fell pregnant. Oh, I suppose this
                                     just about serves me right.
                           Rosie: Oh God, you sound just like your mother
                                           Donna: I do not!
Rosie: You do! What ever happened to Donna the life and soul of the party and rock chick supremo?
                                  Donna: Oh, she grew up that's all.
                                         Tanya/Rosie: Oooo!
          Tanya: Oh Get back down there. You haven't done anything to be ashamed of.
                                            Rosie: Yeah!

                                          ""Dancing Queen""

                                           Rosie & Tanya:

           (Donna goes to bed while and Tanya sing with deuturant and hair dryers)

                              Friday nights and the lights are low
                                 Looking out for a place to go -
                                             Tanya:
                                Where they play the right music
                                      Getting in the swing
                                              Rosie:

                                             Tanya:
                                   Anybody can be that guy -
                              Night is young and the music's high
                                              Rosie:
                                    With a bit of rock music
                                        Everything is fine
                                You're in the mood for a dance
                                And when you get the chance -
                                       Donna/Tanya/Rosie:

                                    (Donna jumps on bed)

                               Young and sweet only seventeen

                             (Trio looks in mirror when they sing)

                                           Donna:

                                            Rosie:

(Makes sure she looks good but Rosie pulls her and now slide fowrads on staircase except Rosie.)

                                            Donna:
                                        See that girl,
                                            Tanya:

                                           Owwwww!

                (Tanya and Donna dance gracefully while Rosie is a little dizzy)

                                            Donna:
                               You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
                                      Leave 'em burning
                                     And then you're gone
                                              All:
                                   Looking out for another

(Sky is getting ready to go on his stag night. Sophie enters.)

                                       Sophie: Where are you going?
 Sky: Oh hello! Well, there's lap dancing at the Orpheus Bar, mud wrestling at Medusa's and Pepper's
                                           bringing his handcuffs.
                                              Sophie: Don't Go!
                       Sky: You what? And miss out on my last night of freedom.
  Sophie: I don't mean don't go I mean...(she suddenly realises what he has said)...Is that how you
                                                 really see it?
  Sky: Errrr. See it? I see it....as the last night.....before the biggest adventure of my life. Oh, come
                                                     here.

                                            (They Embrace)

                        Sophie: You know I said I wanted to find my dad.
Sky: We've been through this a thousand times Sophie. You don't need your dad. I'm here. All right?
              Sophie: Yeah. Sky? Whatever happens you'll never leave me will you?
                    Sky: Are you crazy? You've turned my world upside down

                                       ""Lay All Your Love On Me""

                                                  Sky:
                                    I wasn't jealous before we met
                            Now every man that I see is a potential threat
                                          And I'm possesive
                                              It isn't nice
                        You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
                                         But now it isn't true
                                        Now everything is new
                                         And all I've learned

                                          Has overturned
                                           I beg of you -
                                               Sophie:
                                   Don't go wasting your emotion
                                      Lay all your love on me

                                    It was like shooting a sitting duck
                           A little small talk, a smile and baby I was stuck
                                              I still don't know
                                        What you've done with me
                            A grown up woman should never fall so easily
                                            I feel a kind of fear
                                       When I don't have you near
                                                  Unsatisfied
                                               I skip my pride
                                               I beg you dear
                                                      Sky:
                                      Don't go wasting your emotion
                                         Lay all your love on me

(The Boys enter and drag Sky and Sophie apart. They strip him down and start to dress him in his wet
                                              suit.)

                                               Boys:
                                   Don't go sharing your devotion
                                      Lay all your love on me

                                     Sky: What the hell's going on?
Eddie: Sorry mate but it's an ancient island tradition. You see the night before the wedding the groom
               dives down to the old ship wreck searching for Helen of Troy's necklace.
                  Pepper: Then a charmed union blesses he who discovers the pearls
                Sky: Well the lads back home just get drunk then drop their trousers
                                 Boy: Crikey mate. We're doing that too!
                                             Boys: Whoa!!!!
              Sky: It's totally crazy. I mean why marry the first man that comes along.
                                              Sophie: Well,

                                     I had a few little love affairs
                      They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
                                                 Sky:
                                    I used to think I was sensible
                          It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
                                               Sophie:
                                        Cos everything is new
                                        And everything is you
                                         And all I've learned
                                            Has overturned
                                            What can I do?

 (The Boys return for the chorus in wet suits and flippers. They lift Sky onto their shoulders and load
                 him into the boat at the side of the stage and push it out to sea.)

                                      Sky/Pepper/Eddie/Boys
                                   Don't go wasting your emotion

                                      Lay all your love on me

(The chorus repeats and the scene changes to the inside of the Taverna. It is all decorated out for the
                     Hen Night and the girls are drinking and suitably rowdy..)

                                                Boys:

Tanya: (Offstage) Well, for one night and one night only the Sheridan Taverna is proud to present the
         one, the only, the world's first Girl Power band. In all it's grown up wrinkly glory.
                          Rosie: (Offstage) Hey! Speak for yourself Tanya.
  Tanya:(Offstage) One night. One number! Cause that's all we've got the breath for!Give it up for

Sophie: So are you regretting that you've stayed away so long?

                                               Sophie: What?
 Sam: This place. The Taverna. I always meant to build it someday you know but she beat me to it .

               fought we...well I'll tell you something it was me who bought her here.

                                 Sophie: Oh, you don't want children?
    Harry: No, it's not that. Do you know, I'd have loved a daughter. I'd have spoiled her to bits.
                                         Sophie: Lucky thing!

                                              Sophie: Go on.
    Bill: How did your mother this place . When I knew her she was singing in a nightclub on the
                                                 mainland.
Sophie: She was left some money in a will. We lived with an old lady when I was little. Her name was
                                                  Sophia.

        Sophie: She wont talk about the past. She doesn't understand. But I need to know.
                                 Bill: Well you'll have to speak to her
Sophie: This has got nothing to do with her. My whole life has been one big unanswered question and
                                     I don't want any more secrecy.

                                I'm getting more open hearted.

 Sam: Sophie, I won't beat about the bush. I know why I'm here. And let me tell you I think it's

              brilliant. I've always wanted a little girl. And a big one's even better.
                                      Sophie: No Sam! It's...
     Sam: I know I'm rushing things but just tell me does your mother know that you know.
                                          Sophie: No S...
                         Sam: Good, good. Listen, who's giving you away.
                                         Sophie: No-one.
                                        Sam: Wrong! I am.
                                           Sophie: You?
                                            Sam: Yes!
                                           Sophie: Oh!
               Sam: And don't worry about Donna. She doesn't scare me...much!

        Entr'acte: Nightmare Ballet. Sophie is in bed obviously caught up in a nightmare.

                                         ""Under Attack""

                                            Sophie:
                                   Don't know how to take it
                                    Don't know where to go
                                   My resistance running low
                                    And every day the hold

             Is getting tighter
           And it troubles me so.

                    Chorus:
    You know that I'm no body's fool
                    Sophie:
             I'm no body's fool
         And yet it is clear to me
          I don't have a strategy
             It's just like taking
             Candy from a baby
            And I think I must be
                        -
            Sophie and Chorus:
                 Under attack
               I'm being taken
                About to crack
             Defences breaking
   Won't somebody please have a heart
        Come and rescue me now
           'cos I'm falling apart?

               Under attack
             I'm taking cover
They're on my track, three dads, one lover
 Thinking no thing's gonna stop them now
             Should I want to
               I'm not sure
           I would know how...

                   Sophie:
            This is getting crazy
           I should tell them so
        Really let my anguish show
         I feel like I was trapped
            Within a nightmare
          I've got nowhere to go

             Nightmare Chorus:
         Still undecided I suppose

                    Sophie:
           Yes, it's what I wanted
          but I'm still scared as hell
       Staring down the deepest well
I hardly dare to think of what would happen
            Where I'd be if I fell.

           Sophie and Chorus:
               Under Attack
             I'm being taken
              About to crack
           Defences breaking

                              (Sophie wakes with a scream)

  Donna: What's going on? Sophie? It's six o'clock in the morning. What are you doing?
                                  Sophie: Don't know...
                               Donna: Well wait right there
                                Sophie: I'm all right Mum
              Donna: Course you're not all right. You're sleepwalking again..
                       Sophie: Again? When do I ever sleepwalk?
Donna: The night you couldn't do your times table, the night you went down with measles...

                                 Sophie: Knock it off, I'm not a baby!
  Donna: Well I know that, Sophie, but you're still my daughter and I know when there's something
         wrong. Where do we start? It's not too late - I can sort out this wedding malarkey.
                           Sophie: Malarkey? What do you mean, malarkey?
                               Donna: Sorry, it's just a figure of speech.
Sophie: No it isn't. That's what you think, isn't it? I'm just stupid to get married. It's just a label and
                          Donna: I'm not pretending that I understand Sophia
 Sophie: (Gets worked up) No - Of course you don't. You did just fine without a man, didn't you? You
        didn't do all the marriage and babies thing. You just did the baby. Well good for you!
             Donna: Hang on, what's happening here? Why are you having a go at me?
Sophie: I'm gonna do it right Mum. I love Sky and I wanna be with him and I'm not gonna let my kids
                      grow up not knowing who their Dad is, because it's.... crap.

           (Off stage noises - bagpipes/drums/singing as Eddy, Pepper and Sky approach)

           Donna: All right, All right! Eddie! What are you doing with those monstrosities?

                                      (Bagpipes die discordantly)

 Eddie: Aw - they're upset now (The boys laugh and jeer) We found these beauties in the cellar. Just
                                    what we need for a wedding.
                                   Pepper: Are they yours, Donna?
  Donna: No they're.... Well what sort of a wedding is this gonna be? Look at the state of you three!
     Sky! You are NOT marrying my daughter smelling like a drainage course. Now hit the tubs.

                             (Sky leaves meekly, followed by the Pepper.)

                      Donna: (to Pepper) and where do you think you're going
                  Pepper: (a la English butler, drunk) ... To scrub the groom's back!

Donna: Oh no you're not. I want the champagne on ice, the Uzi in the punch bowls, I want you to lay
   out the tablecloths, cutlery AND the best glasses and I want you to wash and polish 'em first!
         Eddie: (Laughing) Yeah! And don't just blown at 'em and rub 'em on your trousers!
                                Donna: (cross) Eddie! Get your boat out!
                                           Eddie: What hey!
                                            Donna: Eddie!
                                             Eddie: Why?
  Donna: Because my guests want to dive down to the old wreck to look for more pearl necklaces.
             Eddie: Aw Donna, Donna. We planted the ones that Sky found last night...
Donna: I don't care. It will keep them happy until the wedding starts! Well, will you for God's sake just
                                                DO IT!

                                                 Exeunt

                                               ""One of Us""

                                               Donna:
                                          One of us is lonely
                                           One of us is only
                                           Waiting for a call
                                           Sorry for herself
                                            Feeling stupid
                                            Feeling small
                                   Wishing you had never left at all.

                                           They passed me by
                                      All of those great romances
                                             Because of your
                                               Robbing me
                                         Of my rightful chances
                                             My picture clear
                                      Everything seemed so easy
                                    But then you dealt me the blow
                                           One of us had to go
                                            How you hurt me
                                           I want you to know

                                          One of us is crying
                                           One of us is lying
                                           In her lonely bed
                                         Staring at the ceiling
                                          Wishing she were
                                      Somewhere else instead.
                                          One of us is lonely
                                           One of us is only
                                           Waiting for a call
                                           Sorry for herself
                                             Feeling stupid
                                             Feeling small

Tanya: Oh don't worry about me, Harry. I've got oodles of time. Nothing worse than sitting around in
                                        your glad rags for hours.
Harry: But Donna must be tearing her hair out doing the wedding on her own! What would the bride's
                                            father usually do?
                 Tanya: Usually... he'd pay. Though my Dad drew a line at the third!
        Harry: And er, did he say anything beforehand - words of advice - that sort of thing?
 Tanya: Yeah - there was me in my dress, ready to waltz down the aisle and whispered 'Don't worry
      love, I know a good lawyer!' (cackles with laughter). Why are we talking about my Dad?
                     Harry: I think I'll go back to my room now - too much sun!

Sophie: Sky!
Sky: Its bad luck to see each other!
Sophie: Its all gone wrong anyway. Sky, you've got to help me.
Sky: Why? What's happened?
Sophie: It's a mess and it's all my fault. I know I shouldn't have but I read Mums diary. And I've got
three possible Dad's!
Sky: Bloody hell!
Sophie: (gabbling) I invited them all to the wedding and I thought I'd know who my father was as

soon as I saw him but I didn't. Now I'm waiting for my Dad to give me away.
Sky: Slow down - go back a bit! You did what?
Sophie: I invited my Dads to our wedding. It was three months ago. I wasn't even sure if they'd all
come..
Sky: Three months...?
Sophie: Sky, you've got to help me.
Sky: Why didn't you tell me?
Sophie: I knew you wouldn't like it.
Sky: I thought we talked about everything. I thought we trusted each other. You went behind my back
to some stranger.
Sophie: It wasn't like that.
Sky: Is that what this big white wedding's for? It's a set up just so you can find your Dad!
Sophie: No it's not.
Sky: I wanted to take a boat out to the mainland. Just get married with a couple of witnesses. You
INSISTED on this FANTASY wedding just so you could play Happy Families!
Sophie: Its knowing who I am. I wanted to get married knowing who I....
Sky: It doesn't come from knowing who your Dad is, Sophia! It comes from YOU! How would you feel
if I'd lied to you? I was marrying you because I loved you , you know? (Getting emotional) I thought
that's what YOU wanted. I just don't know anymore..
Sophie: You don't know if you love me?
Sky: I don't know if that's what you really want.

                                  Sam: I'm sorry - I'm interrupting
                             Sky: No - listen... oh.... Just THINK about it!
                                  Sophie: (remonstrates) Oh Sky...
          Sam: Sophie, leave him, he's right. You have to be sure its what you really want
                             Sophie: This has got nothing to do with you!
    Sam: But I'm your Dad - I can't give you away unless I know you're going to be really happy
Sophie: Well, I've had this conversation with my mother and she knows me a lot better than you do!
  Sam: Yeah - what does Donna the Dynamo know about marriage, eh... or divorce? (Pause) Look
  Sophie, I've got twenty years of good advice to cram into about two minutes so just hear me out.
                     You're so young - you've got your whole life ahead of you...
                                  Sophie: Oh not now Sam, please..
 Sam: But I've been there Sophie, I've done the big white wedding and I've done the cake and the...
you know. It doesn't always turn out happy ever after. Oh, I can still hear my wife screaming at me,

                                    ""Knowing Me, Knowing You""

                                 Breaking up is never easy I know
                                          But I have to go
                                    Knowing me knowing you
                                       It's the best I can do

                                   No more carefree laughter
                                        Silence ever after
                                 Walking through an empty house
                                         Tears in my eyes
                                    This is how the story ends

                                          This is goodbye.
                                   Knowing me, Knowing you
                                   There is nothing we can do,

                                     We just have to face it
                                     This time we're through
                                Breaking' up is never easy I know
                                         But I have to go.
                                    Knowing me, knowing you
                                      It's the best I can do.



                                Sophie: You said you had boys
                              Sam: Yeah, they live with their Mum

                                               Sam:
                                             Memories
                                      Good days, bad days
                                    they'll be with me always
                                   In those old familiar rooms
                                       Children would play
                                    No there's only emptiness
                                           Nothing to say
                                   Knowing me, Knowing you

Sophie: That's you not me, I love Sky more than anything else in the world. Did you feel that when
                                       you got married?
                                    Sam: (pauses) No I didn't
                        Sophie: Well then it'll be all right - I know it will!

                                         (Sophie exits)

                                            Donna's Room

Donna: (talking to herself) Can't get my hat right. Can't get anything right! (Knock at door) Come in!

                                            (Harry enters)

                                            Harry: Donna.
                            Donna: Harry. Harry, what are you doing here?
                       Harry: I wanted to give you this (hands Donna a cheque)
Donna: I don't mean here here, I mean... here on this island?
                                            Harry: Please.
               Donna: (She looks at the cheque) Jesus, Mary and Joseph! What's this?
  Harry: I thought you must have had to tighten your belt a bit over the years. You've been looking
         after Sophie on your own. I wanted to contribute a little something to the wedding.
    Donna: Well this would cover FOUR weddings and a funeral! Harry, it's a lovely gesture but...
                     Harry: Do you remember the last time you said that to me?
                                              Donna: No.
 Harry: The night I bought you the guitar. I can remember thinking, those are the last words I'll ever
       hear from Donna and I'll always treasure them ""Oh Harry, it's a lovely gesture BUT....'
 Donna: You're making that up. I'm sure I just said 'Thank you' nicely like a well brought up catholic
                                                 girl!
     Harry: That's better. Do you know that's the first time I've seen you laugh since I arrived?
                          Donna: A bit stressed, Harry, what do you expect?
          Harry: A bit more of the old Donna - a bit less of the well brought up Catholic girl!

                                         ""Our Last Summer""

                                                Harry
                                          I can still recall
                                         Our last summer
                                          I still see it all.
                                       Walks along the Seine
                                        Laughing in the rain
                                         Our last summer
                                       Memories that remain.

                                         We made our way
                                           Along the river
                                          And we sat down
                                            On the grass
                                         By the Eiffel tower
                                     I was so happy we had met
                                     It was the age of no regret
                                               Oh yes.

                                         Those crazy years
                                         That was the time
                                        Of the flower power
                                          But underneath
                                       We had a fear of flying
                                           Of growing old
                                       A fear of slowly dying
                                        We took our chance

                     Like we were dancing
                        Our last dance.

                          Harry/Donna:
                         I can still recall
                        Our last summer
                          I still see it all

                             Harry:
                       In the tourist jam

                           Donna:
                    Round the Not re Dame

                        Harry/Donna:
                      Our last summer
                     Walking hand in hand

                            Donna:
                       Paris restaurants

                         Harry/Donna:
                       Our last summer
                             Harry
                      Morning croissants
                         Harry/ Donna
                       Living for the day
                       Worries far away
                       Our last summer
                    We could laugh and play

                             Donna:
               And now you're working in a bank
                        The family man
                         A football fan
                    And you name is Harry
                      How dull it seems
                    Yet, you were the hero
                       Of my dreams...
                         Harry/Donna
                        I can still recall
                       Our last summer
                        I still see it all.
                    Walks along the Seine
                     Laughing in the rain
                       Our last summer
                   Memories that remain...

Donna: Harry, I cant take this. I dunno why you think I should.
         Harry: I want you to have it (Knock at door)
                        Donna: Come in
Harry: We can't talk about this now. I'll see you at the wedding.
                     Donna: The wedding?
                 Harry: Yes. I've been invited.

                                           Donna's Room

                                   (Harry leaves, Sophie enters)

                                   Donna: That the dress then?
                                          Sophie: Yeah...
            Donna: (hesitantly) Marvellous. Right, so are Ali and Lisa ready to help you?
                                 Sophie: Mum, will you help me?

                                   ""Slipping Through My Fingers""

                                               Donna
                                         School bag in hand
                               She leaves home in the early morning
                            Waving goodbye with an absentminded smile
                                           I watch her go
                              With a surge of that well known sadness
                                 And I have to sit down for a while.
                               The feeling that I'm losing her forever
                               And without really entering her world.
                            I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter

                                         That funny little girl.
                              Slipping through my fingers all the time
                                    I try to capture every minute
                                            The feeling in it
                              Slipping through my fingers all the time
                                 Do I really see what's in her mind
                              Each time I think I'm close to knowing
                                        She keeps on growing
                              Slipping through my fingers all the time

                           Donna: (prepares dress for Sophie) Right! Hop in!
                              Sophie: Do you think I'm letting you down?
                                             Donna: Why?
Sophie: Cos everyone says 'Your Mums so cool' bringing up a kid, running a business all on her own..'
Donna: Well, didn't really have much choice, did I? Couldn't really go back home an unmarried Mum in
                            the 70's. (emotionally) My mother disowned me
                                              Sophie: No!
          Donna: It was the bloody best thing. Rather than some rainy old housing estate.

                                         Sleep in our eyes
                                Her and me at the breakfast table
                                            Barely awake
                                     I let precious time go by
                                      Then when she's gone
                                There's that old melancholy feeling
                                 And a sense of guilt I can't deny
                           What happened to the wonderful adventures?
                             The places I had planned for us to go?
                           Well some of that we did but most we didn't
                                    And why I just don't know

                              Slipping through my fingers all the time
                                    I try to capture every minute
                                            The feeling in it
                              Slipping through my fingers all the time
                                 Do I really see what's in her mind
                              Each time I think I'm close to knowing
                                        She keeps on growing
                              Slipping through my fingers all the time

                                          Donna/Sophie:
                          Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
                             And save it from the funny tricks of time
                                   Slipping through my fingers

       Sophie: Will you give me away? (Donna emotionally nods) I'm really proud of you, Mum

                                  They embrace and Sophie exits

                                              Donna
                                        School bag in hand
                               She leaves home in the early morning
                                          Waving goodbye
                                    With an absentminded smile

                                          Sam: Donna?
                                      Donna: Not now Sam.
                        Sam: Sophie tells me that you're giving her away..
                                    Donna: Yes I am. Who else?
                                    Sam: What about her dad?
                                     Donna: Her dad isn't here
Sam: It's what she wants. She told me she wants her father here. Maybe her father wants her as well
           Donna: What? Don't you do this to me now Sam. I don't wanna hear this now!
                            Sam: Donna, Donna, listen. This is about us

                                     ""The Winner Takes It All""

                                              Donna:
                                        I don't want to talk
                               About the things we've gone through
                                      Though it's hurting me
                                          Now it's history
                                     I've played all my cards
                                 And that's what you've done too
                                       Nothing more to say
                                       No more ace to play

                                      The winner takes it all
                                     The loser standing small
                                        Beside the victory
                                        That's her destiny

      I was in your arms
  Thinking I belonged there
   I figured it made sense
     Building me a fence
     Building me a home
 Thinking I'd be strong there
        But I was a fool
     Playing by the rules

The gods may throw the dice
 Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
    Loses someone dear
   The winner takes it all
     The loser has to fall
  It's simple and it's plain
  Why should I complain?

  But tell me does she kiss
   Like I used to kiss you?
    Does it feel the same
 When she calls your name?
  Somewhere deep inside
 You must know I miss you
      But what can I say
    Rules must be obeyed

   The judges will decide
    The likes of me abide
   Spectators of the show
     Always staying low

    The game is on again
      A lover or a friend
    A big thing or a small
    The winner takes it all

       I don't wanna talk
  Cause it makes me feel sad
        And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
           I apologise
   If it makes you feel bad
      Seeing me so tense
       No self confidence
          But you see
    The winner takes it all
    The winner takes it all

    The game is on again
     A lover or a friend
    A big thing or a small

                                        The winner takes it all
                                        The winner takes it all

                                            Act II, Scene 9
                                                Chapel



                          (Rosie is lighting the votive candles. Bill enters.)

                                                      Bill: Rosie?
                           Rosie: Er... go and wait with the others till I'm finished?
    Bill: I just got this note from Sophie. I'm confused. She wanted me to give her away. Now she's
       changed her mind. I don't know where I am. I don't know who I am. I just came here for a
                                                      wedding...
                                  Rosie: Eh? (suddenly realises what he said)
                                           Bill: Look - I'm Sophie's Dad
                             Rosie: Whoa! You need a conversation with Donna
                            Bill: I'll go now (Bill turns as if to go and find Donna)
   Rosie: No - You'll do no such thing. Sophie's getting married in five minutes. Go take a pew. And
                                                     BUTTON IT!
                                    Bill: Will it be all right for me to be here?
                                          Rosie: (Groans) For God's sake
Bill: Well, to tell you the truth, I was praying that I wouldn't walk down the aisle anyway. I may come
     across the intrepid traveler. But I come over all faint before a wedding. (Sits and mops brow)
                                          Rosie: Ha ha ! Tell me about it
 Bill: Marriage! Church! Responsibility! I'm a writer. I made my mind up long ago I walk a lone path!
                 Rosie: (Nervous laugh and hesitantly starts to sing in a broad, sassy style)

                                       ""Take A Chance On Me""

                                                 Rosie:
                                       If you change your mind
                                           I'm the first in line
                                          Honey I'm still free
                                         Take a chance on me
                                     If you need me let me know
                                            Gonna be around
                        If you've got no place to go when you're feeling down

                                          If you're all alone
                                  When the pretty birds have flown
                                         Honey I'm still free
                                       Take a chance on me
                                      Gonna do my very best
                                          And it ain't no lie
                                     If you put me to the test
                                           If you let me try
                                       Take a chance on me
                                       Take a chance on me
                                         We can go dancing

                                               Bill:
                                         We can go walking

                       Rosie:
             As long as we're together
               Listen to some music

                       Bill:
                 Maybe just talking

                      Rosie:
          You'd get to know me better
             Cause you know I got
            So much that I wanna do
         When I dream I'm alone with you
                    It's magic
          You want me to leave it there

                         Bill:
                Afraid of a love affair

                        Rosie:
                But I think you know
                 That I want you so

               If you change your mind
                   I'm the first in line
                  Honey I'm still free
                 Take a chance on me
                       Rosie/Bill:
             If you need me let me know
                    Gonna be around
If you've got no place to go when you're feeling down

                  If you're all alone
          When the pretty birds have flown
                 Honey I'm still free
               Take a chance on me

             If you put me to the test
                   If you let me try

                       Rosie:
                Take a chance on me

                       Bill:
       Oh come on, give me a break will you

                       Rosie:
                Take a chance on me

          Oh you can take your time baby
                  I'm in no hurry
             I know I'm gonna get you
            You don't want to hurt me

                                                Bill:
                                          Baby don't worry

                                                 Rosie:
                                         I ain't gonna let you
                                         Let me tell you now
                                      Our love is strong enough
                                    To last when things get rough
                                               It's magic

                                              Rosie/Bill:
                                    You say that I waste my time
                                   But I can't get you off my mind
                                        And I think you know
                                          That I want you so

                                           Act II, Scene 10
                                             The Chapel

                            (Choir sing anthem as Sophie enters chapel)

  Minister: Please be seated. Welcome. Welcome to Sophie and Sky and to all your friends who are
  gathered here on this day. And welcome especially to Donna who represents your family. Dearly
                     beloved, we are gathered here today, in the sight of God....
Donna: (interrupting) Welcome to Sophie's Dad. I have to tell you. It isn't fair to keep it from you any
                                          longer. He's here.
                                            Sophie: I know.
                                             Donna: What?
                                        Sophie: I invited him!
                Donna: But you can't have done. I don't know which one of 'em it is!
                                          Rosie: Oh my God!
                                           Donna: Oh dear!
                   Sophie: Mum I'm really, really sorry. Will you ever forgive me?
                      Donna: Oh I don't know Sophie. Will you ever forgive me?
                      Sophie: I don't care if you've slept with hundreds of men!

                                  (Minister and Donna look aghast.)

                                            You're my Mum!
                           Donna: I have NOT slept with hundreds of men.
Sam: Hang on, hang on, hang on are we saying that I might be Sophie's Dad, but it might be Bill or it
                                        might even be Harry?
                                         Donna: You've got it!
                                             Sam: Oozier?
     Donna: Well its no use getting self righteous with me - you've only got yourself to blame.
                                            Sam: You what?
      Sophie: Yeah. If you hadn't dumped my Mum and gone off and married someone else...
Sam: No, no, no, no.. it wasn't like that. I was engaged. I had to go home. I thought it was the right
                               thing to do. (quietly) But I came back.
                                    Donna: (incredulously) What?
              Sam: Yeah I told Lorraine I couldn't marry her and I came straight back.
                                 Donna: Well why didn't you call me?
 Sam: Because I was daft enough to think that you might be sitting in your room pining for me! Only
when I got here, they told me that you'd gone off with some other bloke! (All look at Harry) So I went

           back to Lorraine, who told me what an idiot I was.. and married me to prove it.
    Harry: I'm sorry. If ...I, I , I might come in for a minute for a moment, there's something...
                                Donna: Oh Harry, the cheque... I'm sorry
   Harry: Oh no - no sod the cheque - it's yours. It's great to have even a third of Sophie. I never
                               thought Id get even that much of a child...
                                            Donna: Oh Harry...
Harry: Donna you were the first girl I loved. But you were also the last girl. Look. There are all kinds
     of families aren't there. Yours is you and Sophie. Mine is me.... (proclaims) and Lawrence!
Sam: Well look he's right. We can find out if we want to but I agree with Harry. Being a third of your
                                            Dad is great by me.
                                                Bill: Me too!
 Rosie: (incredulously) Cor, well, bloody typical isn't it. Wait twenty years for a Dad, and then three
                                            come along at once.
  Sophie: I don't know which one of you is my Dad, but I don't mind. I've learned something about
 myself. Sky. Let's NOT get married. I know you never wanted any of this anyway. OK I've got my
              whole life ahead of me. Let's just get off this island and get at that world!
                                              Sky: I love you.
                          Minister: Donna, I take it the wedding's cancelled?
                              Donna: I haven't got a clue what's going on.
Sam: Now hold on, hold on. Why waste a good wedding? How about it Sheridan? You're gonna need
                               body to boss around on this island of yours.
                               Donna: Are you nuts? I am not a bigamist!
Sam: Neither am I. I am a divorced man... who's loved you for 21 years! And ever since I got on this
                           island, I've been bursting to show you how much.

                                  (Tanya bubs loudly with emotion)

                            Come on Donna! It's only the rest of your life.

                                       ""I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do""

                                                Sam:
                                          I can't conceal it
                                  Don't you see, can't you feel it?
                                                Girls:
                                  Say I do I do I do I do I do I do
                                                Sam:
                                          Donna let's try it
                                     You love me, don't deny it
                                                Girls:
                                              Say I do?
                                               Donna:
                                       I do I do I do I do I do
                                                Girls:
                                      Oh I've been dreaming
                                      Through my lonely past
                                         Now I just made it
                                         I found you at last
                                    So come on now let's try it
                                      I love you, can't deny it
                                           'Cause it's true
                                       I do I do I do I do I do
                                               Donna:
                              Oh no hard feelings between you and me

                               If we can't make it
                             We'll just wait and see
                           So come on now let's try it
                            I love you, can't deny it

                    (Sky and Sophie exit after the wedding.)

                                       All:
                                 'Cause it's true
                             I do I do I do I do I do

                             Love me or leave me
                        Make your choice but believe me
                                   I love you
                            I do I do I do I do I do

                               I can't conceal it
                        Don't you see, can't you feel it?
                                Don't you too?
                            I do I do I do I do I do

                                    Epilogue




          (Sky and Sophie enter dressed to leave for the mainland...)

                          ""I Have A Dream - Reprise""

                                     Sophie:
                                 I have a dream
                                  A song to sing
                                To help me cope
                                  With anything
                             If you see the wonder
                                  Of a fairytale
                            You can take the future
                                 Even if you fail

                               I believe in angels
                      Something good in everything I see
                               I believe in angels
                      When I know the time is right for me
                              I'll cross the stream
                                  I have a dream

(Sky and Sophie say their farewells to Donna, Sam, Harry, Bill, Rosie and Tanya.)

                                   Company:
                                I have a dream
                                   A fantasy
                              To help me through
                                    Reality
                              And my destination

                             Makes it worth the while
                           Pushing through the darkness
                                 Still another mile

                                I believe in angels
                       Something good in everything I see
                                I believe in angels
                       When I know the time is right for me
                               I'll cross the stream
                                   I have a dream
                               I'll cross the stream

                                        Sophie:
                                    I have a dream
                                I'll cross the stream
                                    I have a dream

Midnight in Paris
      By Woody Allen




         Page 1/54

This is unbelievable!
Look at this!
There's no city like this in the world.
There never was!
You act like you've never been here before.
I don't get here often enough.
That's the problem.
Can you picture how drop-dead
gorgeous this city is in the rain?
Imagine this town in the '20s.
Paris in the '20s,
in the rain; the artists and writers.
Why does every city have to be in the rain?
What's wonderful about getting wet?
I mean, could you ever picture us
moving here after we're married?
Oh God, no.
I could never live out of the United States.
You know, if I'd stayed here and written novels,
and not gotten, you know, caught up in that,
just, grinding out movie scripts...
I'll tell you something:
I would drop the house in Beverly Hills,
the pool, everything,
in a second.

I mean, look:
This is where Monet lived and painted.
We're 30 minutes from town.
Imagine the two of us settling here.
We could do it, I mean,
if my book turns out.
You're in love with a fantasy.
I'm in love with you.
We should get back to town.
We're meeting Mom and Dad for dinner.
Let's meet 'em.
There are our sightseers.
If I never see another charming
boulevard or bistro again, I...
- What a town!
- Yes. To visit.
I could see myself living here!
I feel like the Parisians kind of ""get me.""


                                 Page 2/54

I can see myself just strolling
along the Left Bank with a,
you know, baguette under my arm,
headed to Caf de Flore
to scribble away on my book.
What did Hemingway say?
He called it a ""moveable feast.""
In this traffic, nothing moves.
Well, a toast to John's new business venture here!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Well, I'll be perfectly frank.
I'm excited about this corporate merger between
our folks and the French company, but otherwise,
I'm not a big Francophile.
- John hates their politics.
- Certainly been no friend to the United States.
Well, I mean, you can't exactly blame them
for not following us down that rabbit's hole in Iraq.
- The whole Bush, you know,...
- Oh, please. Let's not get into this
- bad discussion again and again.
- Honey, honey. We're not getting into-- By the way, it's
fine for your father and I to disagree.
That's what a democracy is.
Your father defends the right-wing of the Republican party,
and I happen to think you almost got to be
- like, a demented lunatic, but it's like...
- Okay. Okay!
But it doesn't mean we don't
respect each other's views, am I right?
- Can we talk about the wedding plans?
- Yes! Please.
Let's do that.
- Your father is just...
- Inez?
- Huh? Carol?
- Hi.
Oh my G... What are you doing here?
- Nice to see you! Hi.
- Hey!
- How are you?


                                 Page 3/54

- Good, thanks.
Paul and Carol Bates, this is my mother
- and father, and, of course, you know Gail.
- Hi. Very nice to meet you.
Well, you... you didn't mention
you were going to be here.
No, it was sudden. Um...
Paul got invited to lecture at
the Sorbone.(sic.) Sorbonne.
Oh, how wonderful!
Well, uh, Dad's here on business,
and we just decided to
- freeload along. - Yes.
- Oh.
That's great. We can spend some time together.
Well, I think we have a
lot of commitments, but I'm sure it's...
- What?
- Well, what are doing tomorrow?
- We're driving to Verrsailles. (sic.)
- Versailles...
- Versailles.
- Oh,
- I'm dying to see Versailles.
- Yeah!
But it's too...uh...
We're late...I think what we're...
Tomorrow we're locked in
to a lunch at Brasserie Lipp.
- Oh no, that's just...
- Yeah. Yeah, we are. That's already...
You know I actually had
a professor that dined there,
and saw James Joyce!
Yeah, you know, like a
million years ago, and
apparently, Joyce was eating
sauerkraut and frankfurters.
Is that...
That's the end of the story?
Well, I mean it's not a story.
It's like a detailed...
- We would LOVE to go to Versailles. Yes.
- Oh, good.


                                 Page 4/54

I hope you're not going to be
as antisocial tomorrow at Versailles.
- How was I antisocial?
- Oh, please!
I mean, you could totally tell you didn't want to go.
Well, I mean, they're your
friends, and I have to admit
I'm not quite as taken with them as you are.
He's brilliant.
You know, I had such a crush on him
in college, and Carol's very bright.
Well, he's a pseudo-intellectual.
- Just a little bit.
- Uh, Gil,
I hardly think he'd be lecturing at
the Sorbonne if he's a pseudo-intellectual.
You should give him your book to read.
Oh, come on. Why?
No, because he could critique your writing,
and maybe show you why you're
having so much trouble.
I'm having trouble because
I'm a Hollywood hack
who never gave actual
literature a real shot.
- Until now.
- Please...Gil...
Honey, just promise me something.
If this book...doesn't pan out,
that you'll stop
eating your brains out,
and just go back to doing
what you do best.
I mean, the studios adore you.
You're in demand...
Do you really want to give
it all up just to struggle?
- Well...
- Mmm?
Mmm?
Why would you...want to do that?
I believe Louis moved his court here,
uh, in 1682.
Originally, all this was swampland.


                                 Page 5/54

In fact, if I'm not mistaken,
uh... in Old French, the word ""versailles""
means, uh, something like,
- ""terrain were the weeds have been pulled.""
- Is that right?
Uh... The... uh, middle section here
uh... is... uh, French classical style at its height.
Uh... The work, I believe, of...
uh, ""Louis Vau"" (Louis le Vau)
- Yes.
- Uh...Mansart...I think...
- Manzard. (sic.)
- ...and Charles le Brun, I believe.
Yes, that's right.
I could get used to a summer home like this.
- I know you could.
- Me, too,
except, remember: in those days,
they only had baths,
and I'm definitely a shower man.
Where are you two planning on
moving after you get married?
Uh...Malibu.
- Really?
- We're thinking about Malibu, yeah.
I'm pushing for a little
attic in Paris with a skylight.
- La bowhem? (sic.)
- Yeah,
all that's missing is the tuberculosis.
Exactly. Thank you.
I mean, you know, the problem
is that he's not exactly sure
- he can write a novel.
- Really?
- Well...
- I mean, honey, so far your track record's-- you know, and...
well, everyone loves your movies.
- Yeah, well scripts are easier, so...
- Wow.
Why don't you tell them about the lead
character that you're working on right now?
- Yes! - Oh, come on.
- I don't like to discuss my work.


                                 Page 6/54

Well, dear, you don't have to tell
them the whole plot, just the character.
- No, no, no.
- Okay.
He works in a nostalgia shop.
- What's a-- What's a nostalgia shop?
- Oh, not one of those stores where they sell
Shirley Temple dolls and old radios?
- And I never know who buys that stuff. Who'd want it?
- Exactly.
- I don't know.
- Well, people who live in the past,
people who think that
their lives would be happier
if they lived in an earlier time.
And just which era
would you have preferred
to live in, Miniver Cheevy?
Paris in the '20s, in the rain.
- Wouldn't have been bad.
- And the rain was an acid rain.
Oh, I see! And no global warming,
no TV and suicide bombing,
and nuclear weapons, drug cartels!
Usual menu of clichd horror stories.
You know, nostalgia is denial.
- Denial of the painful present.
- Oh, whoa!
Gil is a complete romantic.
I mean, he would be
more than happy living in a
complete state of perpetual denial.
- Really?
- And the name for this fallacy
is called ""golden-age thinking.""
- Touch.
- Yeah, the erroneous notion that
a different time period is better
than the one one's living in.
It's a flaw in the Romantic
imagination of those people who...
who find it difficult to
cope with the depressive.
- Yes.


                                 Page 7/54

- This is the nicest ring we saw.
Diamonds for a wedding band.
That's the way you'd have to go.
And then, everyone will see
it in the back row when
he puts it on my finger.
Oh, Inez. It's gonna be such an event!
- I only wish that...
- I don't want to keep going over it.
It's your choice. What can I say?
Gil is-- he's smart,
and he's very successful.
- He talks about giving that all up and moving here!
- Oh, yeah, he TALKS about it.
Well, that frightens me.
This is, of course, Rodin's most famous statue.
A cast of this work was placed next to his tomb.
Rodin wished it to serve as his headstone and epitaph.
- Is that true?
- It would be in Moudon. He died of the flu,
if I'm not mistaken. In 1917, I believe.
- Very good, sir.
- He's so knowledgeable, isn't he?
Yeah. So much of Rodin's work was influenced by his wife, Camille.
Yes, she was an influence, though
Camille was not the wife, but his mistress.
- Camille? No.
- Yes.
- Yes. Rose was the wife.
- No, he was never married to Rose.
Yes, he did marry Rose,
- in the last year their lives.
- I think you're mistaken.
Are you arguing with the guide?
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. No, I'm certain, monsieur.
Yeah, actually, she's right.
I recently read a two-volume
biography on Rodin, and
Rose was definitely the wife.
Camille, the mistress.
- Yeah. You read that? Where did you...
- Yeah, I just read it. I was surprised
because I mistakenly thought, like you, that it was, yeah,


                                 Page 8/54

the other way around.
It's an easy mistake.
So, Dad invited you guys for a wine-tasting.
- Oh, it'll be so French!
- Yeah, yeah.
Paul is an expert on French wine.
- You're joking. Really?
- Yes, of course.
When did you read the biography on Rodin?
Me? Why would I read
a biography on Rodin?
I will always take a California wine, but,
Napa Valley's 6,000 miles away.
John, old boy, how are you, buddy?
Oh, hey! What're you doing here?
Come on. I can't stand that guy.
Um...How 'bout
- we try some more wine?
- Yes! Let's start here.
Now, which would you prefer here?
Well, I think we need to be scientific and just
start drinking them all again. I don't know.
- Why are your cheeks so red?
- What do you mean?
- They're not red.
- They're bright red.
Oh, maybe it's because of the
pheromones that you're giving off.
These pheromones are driving me mad!
- Stop it! Stop!
- Ahh-- Sex and alcohol.
- Yeah.
- It fuels the desire
but kills the performance,
according to the Bard.
Have you tasted the '61?
It is divine!
- Though, Paul picked it out. I didn't...
- What?
- What's happening? What's happening?
- Slightly more tannic than the '59,
and I prefer a smoky feeling
to a fruity feeling.
So, Carol-- Carol and I


                                 Page 9/54

are gonna go dancing.
We heard of a great place. Interested?
- No... I don't want to be a killjoy,
- Come on!
but I need to get a little fresh air.
Oh, come on! Come on!
Although if you're just gonna sit there and obsess
over where the fire exits are, then...
Hey! If Gil doesn't want to go,
I'll share Paul with you.
I am very democratic,
and Paul is a marvelous dancer.
If it's OK with you,
I think I just want to take a little walk,
go to bed, and then we'll do it another night.
OK. Alright, well I can go, though, right?
- You want to go?
- Well, yeah,
Yeah, I mean, I'm not tired,
and I've been dying to go dancing,
and I'll just meet you back at the hotel.
- I'll take good care of her.
- OK.
I'll get a cab. Taxi!
- OK, but you should take a cab.
- No, I'm not taking a cab. I'm walking.
- No, you'll get lost.
- OK, I'm gonna walk.
Is he a good writer?
I mean, have you read his prose?
- Well, he won't let anybody.
- He won't let?
Oh look, I mean, if he wants, I'd be glad to
look over his novel and critique it for him.
- That would be great!
- Would you?
- You know, I think that's what he needs!
- Yeah?
- Well, it helps.
- To have it read by someone. Yeah!
- And you wouldn't pull any punches?
- Well, I certainly won't be letting
you know I won't do that.
-No.


                                 Page 10/54

I do that about you.
See, but, the problem is,
when it comes to his writing,
he has absolutely no respect
for anybody else's opinion.
Really?
Oh, excuse me! Parlez-vous...
Do you speak English?
- Uh...Htel Bristol?
- Parle pas anglais. Dsol.(We don't speak English. Sorry.)
(Hey! Get in! Come on!)
Montez! On va vous laisser!
(Get in! We're going to leave you!)
- What?
- Come on, guy.
- I didn't hear you. What?
- Come on!
Come on, guy!
Get in the car!
Guys, I think you've got me mixed up.
Vous allez me faire fatigu. Venir!
(You're making me tired. Come on!)
I can't understand you.
I'm a little drunk! I can't...
What is this, an old Peugeot?
I have a friend who collects these in Beverly Hills.
Come on, have a drink. Come on!
- Come on, buddy! Come on!
- OK.
Give me your hand. OK.
Sit down, here.
- Let's go in. Paris, the city of lights.
- Allez! On y va!(Let's go! We're off!)
OK, now, where are
you guys taking me?
On va faire la fte!
(We're going to party!)
Yeah, this isn't quite fair,
'cause I've already had a lot of red wine tonight.
Mais dtendez-vous! Vous voulez du champagne.
(Relax! Have some champagne.)
I do like champagne, yeah...
Sant! Sant!(Cheers! Cheers!)
- The night is young. Drink up!

- I'm drinking!
- Have a drink!
Yeah, drink up!
[Cole Porter's ""Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love""]
Let's fall in love
In Spain, the best upper-sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it. Let's fall in love.
The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it - think of Siamese twins
Some Argentines without means do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it - Let's fall in love
Romantic sponges, they say do it
Oysters down in Oyster Bay do it
Let's do it - Let's fall in love
- You look lost!
- Oh, yeah!
- You're an American?
- If you count Alabama as America, which I do.
I miss the bathtub gin.
What do you do?
- Me? I'm a writer.
- Who do you write?
- Oh, right now I'm working on a novel.
- Oh, yes?
I'm Zelda, by the way.
Oh, Scott! Scott!
- Yes, what it is, sweetheart?
- Here's a writer, from, um... where?
- California.
- Scott Fitzgerald, and who are you, old sport?
Gil...the...
You have the same names as...
As what?
Scott Fitzgerald and...
Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. The Fitzgeralds.
Isn't she beautiful?
Yes. Yes! Yeah, that's...
that's a coincidence...like....uh...
You have a glazed look in your eye.
Stunned. Stupefied. Anesthetized. Lobotomized.
I...I...keep looking at the man playing piano, and I

believe it or not, recognize his
face from some old sheet music.
I know I can be one of the great writers
of musical lyrics - not that I can write melodies, and I try,
and then I hear the songs he writes,
and then I realize: I'll never write a great lyric,
- and my talent really lies in drinking.
- Sure does.
Yeah, but, he didn't write the music, did he?
That's not possible...
So...um...
- What kind of books do you write?
- I...I...I'm working on a...um...
Where am I?
Oh, I'm sorry. Don't you know the host?
Some friends have gotten together
a little party for Jean Cocteau.
Hey, lady. What...
Are you kiddding me?
I know what you're thinking.
This is boring. I agree!
I'm ready to move on. Let's do Bricktop's!
- Bricktop's?
- I'm bored! He's bored! We're all bored.
We. Are. All. Bored.
Let's do Bricktop's.
Why don't you tell Cole and Linda
to come with, and...um...
uh...Gil? You coming?

Greetings and salutations.
You'll forgive me.


                                 Page 13/54

I've been mixing grain and grape.
Now, this a writer. uh...Gil. Yes?
- Gil...Gil Pender.
- Gil Pender.
Hemingway.
Hemingway?
You liked my book?
Liked? I loved!
All your work.
Yes, it was a good book,
because it was an honest book,
and that's what war does to men.
And there's nothing fine and noble
about dying in the mud,
unless you die gracefully,
and then it's not only noble, but brave.
Did you read my story?
What'd you think?
There was some fine writing in it,
but it was unfulfilled.
- I might've known you'd hate it.
- But darling, you're too sensitive.
You liked my story, but he hates me!
Please, old sport,
you make matters extremely difficult.
I'm jumpy. Suddenly I don't like
the atmosphere here any more.
Ah! Where're you going?
Para reunirse con mis amigos en Saint-Germain.
(To meet some friends on Saint-Germain.)
- He's going to Saint-Germain. I'm going with him.
- Zelda, sweetheart...
If you're going to stay here and drink
with him, I'm going with the toreador.
Would you bring her back
at a reasonable time?
- She'll drive you crazy, this woman.
- She's exciting,
and she has talent.
This month it's writing.
Last month it was something else.
You're a writer. You need time to write.
Not all this fooling around.
She's wasting you because she's


                                 Page 14/54

really a competitor. Don't you agree?
Me?
Speak up, for Christ's sake! I'm asking if
you think my friend is making a tragic mistake.
Actually, I don't know the Fitzgeralds that well.
You're a writer. You make observations.
You were with them all night!
Could we not discuss my personal life in public?
She's jealous of his gift,
and it's a fine gift. It's rare.
- You like his work? You can speak for it.
- Stop it! Stop it.
You like Mark Twain?
I'm going to find Zelda.
I don't like the thought
of her with that Spaniard.
May I?
Yeah, I'm actually a huge Mark Twain fan.
I think you can even make the case
that all modern American literature
comes from Huckleberry Finn.
- You box?
- No. Not really. No.
What're you writing?
- A novel.
- 'Bout what?
It's about a man who works
in a nostalgia shop.
What the hell is a nostalgia shop?
A place where they sell old things. Memorabilia.
and... Does that sound terrible?
No subject is terrible if the story is true.
If the prose is clean and honest,
and if it affirms grace and courage under pressure.
No good.
Can I ask you the biggest favor in the world?
- What is it?
- Would you read it?
- Your novel?
- Yeah, it's like
looking for, you know, an opinion.
My opinion is I hate it.
I mean, you haven't even read it.
If it's bad, I'll hate it


                                 Page 15/54

because I hate bad writing,
and if it's good, I'll be envious and hate it all the more.
You don't want the opinion of another writer.
Yeah. You know, it's just...
You know what it is?
I'm having a hard time,
you know, trusting somebody to evaluate it.
Writers are competitive.
I'm not gonna be competitive with you.
You're too self-effacing.
It's not manly.
If you're a writer,
declare yourself the best writer!
But you're not, as long as I'm around.
Unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it?
No, I don't.
Hey, I'm not gonna read your novel,
but I'll tell you what I'll do.
Yes?
I'll bring it to Gertrude Stein's.
She's the only one I trust with my writing.
You'll show my novel to Gertrude Stein?
- Give it to me.
- I'll bring it to you.
- And she gets back from Spain tomorrow.
- Great.
I'm gonna go get it.
I'm gonna...
I can't tell you how excited I am!
This is gonna be such a lift!
My heart is just racing right now!
I'm gonna get it, and I'll be back.
Whoa, whoa, Gil!
Take it easy!
You had a big night.
Fitzgerald. Hemingway!
Papa!
You gotta...
OK, we never said where
we were gonna meet.
Good thing you didn't go last night.
You would've hated the music, and the crowd,
but I had fun.
What're you thinking about?


                                 Page 16/54

You seem like you're in a daze.
If I was to tell you that I spent
last night with Ernest Hemingway
and Scott Fitzgerald,
- what would you say?
- Is that what you were dreaming about?
Your literary idols?
Yeah, but if I wasn't dreaming...
What does that mean?
If I was with Hemingway,
and Fitzgerald,
and Cole Porter.
I'd be thinking brain tumor.
And when I tell you,
Zelda Fitzgerald is exactly
as we've come to know her through
everything we've read in books and articles.
You know, charming, but all over the map.
You know, she does not like
Hemingway one bit.
and Scott knows Hemingway is right about her,
but you can see how conflicted he is because he loves her!
Come on! Get up! We should
quit the idle chatter,
because we're gonna be late.
You know, I'm not gonna...
I think I'm gonna stay here
and do some work on my novel,
'cause there's a little polishing I wanna do.
No. You can do that later.
Mom said we can use her decorator's discount. Get up!
Come look at these, Inez.
Wouldn't these be charming in a Malibu beach house?
- Combien, monsieur? (How much, sir?)
- Dix-huit mille. (18,000)
- Merci. (Thanks.)
- What is that?
There a steal at $18,000.
$18,000 for this?
Oh wait. It's Euros, so it's more.
- So that's like 20. $20,000.
- Even more, I think. Yeah.
I know, but it's very hard
to find anything like this at home.


                                 Page 17/54

- She's right, Gil.
- I know, but we haven't even found a house yet,
and we're trying to keep expenses down,
so I don't have to take any crummy rewrite jobs.
Well, you get what you pay for.
- Nice.
- Cheap is cheap.
OK, you guys want to walk back?
Walk? No, it's starting to rain.
Oh, it'll be nice walking in the rain!
It's beautiful!
No, there's nothing beautiful
about walking in the rain.
No, don't forget.
We're taking you to dinner tonight.
Oh, right. Yes. Great.
And then, also, I have a big
surprise for you after dinner.
- What? No. I don't like surprises.
- I have an incredible...Trust me, you're gonna love this.
- What is it?
- Are you sure you don't want to walk in the rain?
This is our last chance.
It's not that bad out.
Okay.
I don't understand.
Where are we going?
But, you made us rush through dinner,
and Dad wasn't finished with his profiteroles.
Profiteroles? You're going to have
the most amazing adventure of your life!
- Where?
- Just, Inez, please.
- Why are you carrying that manuscript around?
- You'll see, and when you do,
your jaw is gonna drop.
OK. You know I wouldn't hide anything,
so if I'm saying it's incredible,
- it's...
- OK.
- It's just, I don't understand!
- I know. You've been wondering why I've been acting strange all day?
- Yeah.
- Well, you're about to find out,


                                 Page 18/54

and you're gonna wonder why I wasn't
acting more strange, when you find out.
- This is very...
- I know. I know.
Well, I don't know what you're carrying on about,
but this is not my idea of an amazing adventure.
I am tired from the gym and a massage,
so I'm gonna get this cab.
- Taxi!
- Inez, wait!
- Let's just wait a little longer.
- Look,
you want to walk the streets of Paris,
and take it in by night,
that's fine. You go ahead.
But I'm in the middle of a great book that Carol lent me.
Come on, just 10 more minutes,
and then we can walk home.
If I'm asleep when you get in,
don't wake me up.
What am I doing wrong?
Unless she's right,
and I need to see a neurologist.
OK, you left the wine-tasting, a little drunk,
but not out of control.
Lost, you walk along...
this is the spot...
I mean, it's just like a one-shot deal.
The clock struck midnight...
Hello!
Oh, hi, Mr. Hemingway. Here.
Let me just jump in.
The assignment was to take the hill.
There were 4 of us.
lost his hand when a grenade went off
and couldn't fight as he could when I first met him.
And he was young, and brave.
And the hill was soggy from days of rain,
and the hill sloped down toward a road,
and there were many German soldiers on the road.
And the idea was to aim for the first group,
and if our aim was true, we could delay them.
- Were you scared?
- Of what?


                                 Page 19/54

Getting killed?
You'll never write well
if you're afraid of dying.
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do. I'd say it's probably...
maybe my greatest fear, actually.
Well, that's something all men before
you have done. All men will do.
- I know. I know.
- Have you ever made love to a truly great woman?
Actually, my fiance is pretty sexy.
And when you make love to her,
you feel true, and beautiful
passion, and you, for at least that moment,
lose your fear of death.
No. That doesn't happen.
I believe that love that is true and real
creates a respite from death.
All cowardice comes from not loving,
or not loving well, which is the same thing.
And when the man who is brave and true
looks Death squarely in the face
like some rhino-hunters I know,
or Belmonte, who's truly brave.
It is because they love with sufficient
passion, to push death out of their minds,
until it returns, as it does, to all men.
And then you must make really good love again.
Think about it.
- Alice. How the hell are you?
- Hi!
Good? Good. Ah, she's here. Follow me.
- Non. Je ne suis pas d'accord.(No. I don't agree.)
- Mais pourquoi? (But why?)
Parce-que... (Because...)
This is Gil Pender, Miss Stein.
He's a young American writer.
I thought you two should know each other.
I'm glad you're here.
You can help decide which of us is right,
and which of us is wrong.
I was just telling Pablo that
this portrait doesn't capture Adriana.
It has a universality, but no objectivity.


                                 Page 20/54

Non, non, non. Vous ne le comprenez pas correctement.
(No, no ,no. You don't understand correctly.)
Connaisez pas Adriana. Regardez...
(You don't know Adriana. Look...)
Regardez le mouvement, le tableau.
(Look at the motion, the painting.)
C'est exactement ce qu'elle reprsente!
(It's exactly what she represents!)
Non. Tu n'as pas raison.(No. You're wrong.)
Look how he's done her:
dripping with sexual innuendo,
carnal to the point of smoldering,
and, yes, she's beautiful, but
it's a subtle beauty;
an implied sensuality.
I mean, what is your first
impression of Adriana?
Exceptionally lovely.
Belle, mais trop subtile. Plus implicite, Pablo!
(Beautiful, but too subtle. More defined, Pablo!)
Yes, you're right, Miss Stein.
'Course...uh...
you can see why he's lost all objectivity.
He's made a creature of Place Pigalle.
A whore with volcanic appetites.
Non, non! C'est ce qu'elle vraiment si vous la connaissez!
(No, no! It's true if you know her!)
Yes, avec toi, au priv,
(Yes, with you, in private,)
because she's your lover,
but we don't know her that way!
So you make a petit-bourgeois judgment
and turn her into an object of pleasure.
- It's more like a still-life than a portrait.
- Non.
Non. Non. Je ne suis pas d'accord.
(No. No. I do not agree.)
And what's this book of
yours I've been hearing about?
Is this it?
- Yeah, this is...uh...
- I'll take a look.
Have you read it, Hemingway?
No, this I leave to you.


                                 Page 21/54

You've always been a fine judge of my work.
"" ""Out of the Past"" was the name of the store,""
""and its products consisted of memories.""
""What was prosaic and
even vulgar to one generation,""
""had been transmuted by
the mere passing of years""
""to a status at once magical and also camp.""
I love it.
I'm already hooked.
Hooked!
I'll start it tonight,
but first, you and I
have something to talk about.
I've been waiting for two months
for a reply from that editor.
I sent him the piece you and I
looked at, plus four others,
plus four shorter pieces.
And this guy, I gave him a copy of the...
- Nevertheless, two months: nary a word.
- Right.
So were you really hooked
with those opening lines?
Oh, the past has always had a
great charisma for me.
Oh, me, too.
Great charisma for me.
I always say that I was born too late.
Mmm. Moi aussi.
(Mmm. Me, too.)
For me, la Belle poque Paris
would have been perfect.
- Really? Better than now?
- Yes.
Another whole sensibility,
the street lamps, the kiosques,
the...horse and carriages,
and Maxim's then.
You speak very good English.
- No, not really.
- No, you do!
How long have you been dating Picasso?
My God, did I just say that?


                                 Page 22/54

Pardon?
I don't mean to...I didn't mean to pry....
Were you born in Paris?
I was born in Bordeaux.
I moved here to study fashion.
But you don't want to hear all this.
Yes, I do.
Yes, continue.
You moved here to study fashion...
I...came here to study with Coco Chanel,
and I fell in love with Paris,
and also,
a very dark-eyed, haunted
Jewish-Italian painter.
And I knew Amedeo had another woman, but still,
I couldn't resist moving into his apartment when he asked,
and it was a beautiful six months.
M..M...Modigliani?
You lived with...
You lived with Modigliani?
You asked me,
so I'm telling you my sad story.
With Braque, though, there was another woman.
Many.
And now,
with Pablo.
I mean, he's married,
but...
every day, it's on-again, off-again.
I don't know how any woman
can stay with him. He's so difficult.
My God, you take ""art groupie""
to a whole new level!
- Pardon?
- Nothing. I was just saying that...
But tell me about yourself.
- What? Well, what can I say...
- So, have you come to Paris to write?
Because, you know,
these days, so many Americans
feel the need to move here.
Isn't Hemingway attractive?
I love his writing.
I know. Actually, I'm just here visiting.


                                 Page 23/54

Oh, you must stay here.
- Really?
- Yeah. It's a wonderful city, for
- writers, artists.
- I know. I'd like to, but it's not that easy.
And,
I didn't fall in love madly with your book...
- Really?
- ...so I want to hear the rest of it.
- You really like? Because I'm still kind of tinkering...
- Pender?
- Yeah, let's go up to Montmartre. Let's get a drink, OK?
- Uh...yeah.
I'll discuss your book with you as soon as I've finished it.
Where can I reach you?
Why don't I drop back by, instead of you
trying to find me, if that's all right?
- We run an open house.
- Are you coming with us?
I wish that I could.
I cant, but
hopefully I'll see you again eventually.
That would be nice.
- Let's go!
- One of these days, I plan to steal you away from this genius
who's great, but he's no Mir.
I'm Gil Pender.
I was with Hemingway, and Picasso.
Pablo Picasso, and Ernest Hemingway.
I'm Gil Pender, from Pasadena!
Cub Scouts. I failed freshman English.
Little old Gil Pender has his novel
with Gertrude. Stein.
Boy, that girl was so...
lovely.
Well, it's a shame you two didn't
come to the movies with us last night,
We saw a wonderfully
funny American film.
Who was in it?
Oh, I don't know.
I forget the name.
Wonderful but forgettable.
That sounds like a picture I've seen.


                                 Page 24/54

I probably wrote it.
Well, I know it was moronic and infantile, and
utterly lacking in any wit or believability,
- but John and I laughed in spite of all that.
- Have we been down this way yet?
Was it?
What time did you get in last night?
Not that late...uh...
I was...uh...
I'm really finding these midnight strolls
great for me creatively,
without the distractions of the day.
I'll probably end up going on another little
- hike tonight.
- Well, we'll see.
Yeah. We'll see.
Oh, look at those wonderful glass figures.
[Cole Porter's ""You Do Something to Me""]
...that simply mystifies me
Tell me why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me
Vous aimez?
(You like?)
Yes. Very beautiful.
- Oh. You're American.
- Yeah.
You like Cole Porter?
I do. I'm a big fan.
I like to
kind of think I'm a member
of Linda and Cole's inner circle.
I'm kidding.
Very pretty lyrics.
- Very amusing.
- Charming.
Gil?
- Gil? Hi.
- Yeah? Yes.
- Yeah. We should go.
- We're going now?
Yeah. We're meeting Paul and Carol
at the museum for the private showing.
- OK. Yeah. Right.
You know, Paul happens to be an expert in Monet,


                                 Page 25/54

so you'll find it enlightening, I think.
Yeah. OK.
Let's get some culture.
The juxtaposition of color is amazing.
This man was the real father
of abstract expressionism.
I take that back.
Maybe Turner.
I mean, I love Turner,
but, I just find this...
overwhelming.
If I'm not mistaken,
it took him 2 years to complete this.
He worked out of Giverny,
where he was frequently...
I heard that Monet,
one of the things that he used to try to...
Shh! I'm trying to hear Paul say it.
Well, he was frequently
visited by Caillebotte,
an artist who I personally feel was underrated.
Ah. Now.
Here's a superb Picasso.
If I'm not mistaken, he painted
this marvelous portrait of his
French mistress
Madeleine Brissou in the '20s.
Paul, I'm gonna have to
differ with you on this one.
- Really.
- Gil, just pay attention.
You might learn something.
OK, well, if I'm not mistaken,
this was a failed attempt to capture
a young French girl named Adriana,
from Bordeaux, if my art history serves me,
who came to Paris to study
costume design for the theater.
I'm pretty sure she had an affair
with Modigliani, then Braque,
which is how Pablo met her.
Picasso.
Of course, what you don't get
from this portrait


                                 Page 26/54

is the subtlety,
and her beauty.
She was just a knock-out.
What have you been smoking?
I'd hardly call this picture marvelous,
it's more of a petit-bourgeois statement
on how Pablo sees her. Saw her.
He's distracted by the fact
that she was a
absolute volcano in the sack.
Too rich for me.
Where'd Gil run off to?
Work.
Been walking around Paris. You know,
the way the city's lit up at night
allegedly inspires him, so...
But that's OK,
because I'm going dancing with Paul.
Where's Carol?
uh...She's in bed with a bad oyster,
so I'll see you guys later.
Thanks for dinner, Daddy.
Bye, sweetie.
Where do you think
Gil goes every night?
You heard her.
He walks, and gets ideas.
- You sound skeptical.
- No.
I've seen what he earns,
but sometimes I think he's got a...
got a... part missing,
and I didn't like his remark about
Tea Party Republicans.
They are decent
people trying to take back the country.
They are not
crypto-fascist
airhead zombies.
You hear him say that?
Nevertheless, I don't think
your idea of having him followed
- is very practical.
- No?


                                 Page 27/54

I'd like to know where he goes every night.
Well, we know one thing:
he doesn't go dancing.
Oh! Excuse me!
- Is this gentleman bothering you?
- Hello, Gil!
Hey! How are you?
I was hoping we'd see you here.
- What a great party!
- Oh, good.
- It's nice to see you here.
- Thank you.
Oh, Delfine?
- Gil, we'll catch up with you later, OK?
- Sure, sure.
Bon soir, Madame.
(Good evening, Madame.)
- What a surprise!
- It was just a total fluke.
I was at Gertrude Stein's,
she's almost finished with my novel,
and I run into this guy.
Turns out he's Archibald MacLeish.
He says he's on his way over here,
come on over. Oh, I'm not
going to crash the Fitzgeralds,
but then he said you'd be here.
You and Pablo, and...
Oh, Pablo's home.
- We had a...bit of a quarrel.
- Oh no!
- You look like you were having fun with Djuna Barnes, dancing.
- Oh, yeah!
Wait. That was Djuna Barnes?
- Yeah.
- Wow. No wonder she wanted to lead.
Isn't this a wonderful
place to throw a party?
- It's so great!
- Only the Fitzgeralds can do that!
- I want to show you something. Come with me.
- OK.
- So, what about your book?
- It's coming along. Yeah!


                                 Page 28/54

Look at that!
- Wow!
- It's from the turn of the century.
Isn't it beautiful?
It's my favorite era.
I love it so much.
Everything was so perfect.
It's so nice to see you tonight.
- I was hoping to...
- It's so nice to see you!
Voil, ma petite Adriana!
(There she is, my little Adriana!)
Isn't this little Parisian
dream a moveable feast?
Mark my words.
I'm going to steal you away
from that fugitive from
Mlaga one way or another.
Between Belmonte and myself,
whom would you choose?
Vous tes tous deux parfaits.
(You are both perfect.)
But he has more courage.
He faces death more often, and
more directly, and if you chose him,
I'd be disappointed, but I'd understand.
Ella ha elegido Pablo.
(She chose Pablo.)
Yes, she's chosen Picasso,
but Pablo thinks
women are only to sleep
with or to paint.
What about you?
I think a woman is equal
to a man in courage.
Have you ever shot
a charging lion?
Never.
Would you like to know
how that feels?
- I don't think so.
- You ever hunted?
- No.
- You?


                                 Page 29/54

Only for bargains.
Tommonos otra copita.
(Let's take another drink.)
You know, it's so loud,
I wonder if we can go some place
- where we can hear ourselves think a little bit?
- Sure! Bye.
Who wants a fight?
Well, I hope it was nothing
serious with you and Pablo.
He's moody and possessive.
Artists are like children.
Well, you certainly understand why
all these guys want to paint you,
'cause you have just about
one of the best faces ever.
- It's so interesting...
- Oh?
- You're interesting, too, in a lost way.
- Lost?
Well, I guess I am lost.
Tell me more about your book.
My book is kind of a...
You know what?
I couldn't care less about my book tonight.
I just want to walk around Paris with you.
I keep forgetting you're just a tourist.
That's putting it mildly.
I can never decide whether
Paris is more beautiful by day or by night.
No, you can't.
You couldn't pick one. I mean,
I can give you a checkmate
argument for each side.
You know, I sometimes think,
""How's anyone gonna come up with a
book, or a painting, or a
symphony or a sculpture that can
compete with a great city?""
You can't, 'cause, like,
you look around, every...
every street, every boulevard
is its own special art form.
And when you think that in the cold,


                                 Page 30/54

violent, meaningless universe,
that Paris exists, these lights...
I mean, come on, there's nothing
happening on Jupiter or Neptune,
but from way out in space
you can see these lights,
the cafs, people drinking, and singing...
I mean, for all we know,
Paris is the hottest spot in the universe.
- Vous tes un pote.(You are a poet.)
- Aw, come on.
It's just... You're very kind,
but I wouldn't call my babbling poetic.
Although I was on a pretty good roll there.
See anything you like?
Yeah. I'm ashamed to admit
I'm attracted to all of them.
I like cheap sexy.
That makes me shallow.
When I was in Catholic school,
one weekend
my roommate and I,
we paid a girl from Pigalle
to come and teach us all her tricks.
- Honestly?
- Yeah.
Wow. That's...
That's...That's...
I'm going to be thinking about that one.
I love walking with you.
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.
God, is that who I think it is?
What is she doing here,
staring into the water?
Oh my God!
Zelda, what are you doing?!
- Please? I don't want to live!
- Stop!
- What is it?
- Scott and that beautiful countess.
They were-- It was so obvious
they were whispering about me,
and the more they drank,


                                 Page 31/54

the more he fell in love with her!
He...Scott loves only you.
- I can tell you that with absolute certainty.
- No.
- He's tired of me!
- You're wrong. You're wrong. I know.
- How?
- Trust me. I know.
- Sometimes you get a feel for people, and I get...
- My skin hurts!
- What do you mean?
- I don't wanna...I hate the way I look!
Don't do that!
- Here. Take this.
- What is this?
It's a Valium.
It'll make you feel better.
- You carry medicine?
- No, not normally.
It's just since I've been engaged to Inez,
I've been having panic attacks,
but I'm sure they'll subside after the wedding.
I've never heard of Valium.
What is this?
It's the...pill of the future.
You never said you were getting married.
Yeah. You know,
it's still a....
ways in the future.
- Well, good luck with your book, and your wedding.
- Thank you.
I think you'd like Inez.
She has a...
has a very sharp sense of humor, and
she's attractive. She doesn't say
that we agree on everything, but...
But the important things.
Yeah, or...actually,
maybe the small things. The...
Sometimes there's a little bit
of a disconnect with the big things.
She wants to live in Malibu, and
wants me to work in Hollywood, and....
But I will say that we both like


                                 Page 32/54

Indian food.
Not all Indian food, but the...
you know...the pita bread.
We both like pita bread.
I guess it's called naan.
I should go.
Pablo will be missing me.
- Come on. I'll walk you home.
- No. No. No.
Just finish your drink.
I live just around the corner.
- No. Come on. I'm not gonna...
- Well, I...I...prefer to be by myself for a while,
but thank you for the evening.
Bye.
Monsieur? C'est un dommage.
(Sir? It's a shame.)
C'est un dommage.
(It's a shame.)
We met, earlier tonight...
At the party!
Dal, s?
(Dal, yes?)
- Yes...
- Dal!
- I remember!
- Dal. Ya.
Un bouteille de vin rouge!
(A bottle of red wine!)
It can't be...
Yeah....
So?
Un autre verre pour monsieur, s'il vous plat.
(Another glass for this man, please.)
I love the language!
The French!
The waiters? No.
You like the shape of the rhinoceros?
The rhinoceros? Uh...
Haven't really thought about it.
I paint the rhinoceros.
I paint you.
S. Your sad eyes.
Your big lips, melting over the hot sand,


                                 Page 33/54

with one tear.
Yes! And in your tear,
another face.
The Christ's face!
Yes, in the rhinoceros.
Yeah. I mean, I probably do look sad. I'm in...
a very perplexing situation.
Diablo...Luis! Oye, Luis!
(Damn. Luis! Hey, Luis!)
My friends.
This... Seor Buuel.
- Buuel?
- S. Buuel...and...Mr. Man Ray.
- Man Ray? My Gosh!
- How 'bout that?
This is Pen-der. Pen-der.
Pender!
- Yes. And I am Dal!
- Dal. Yes.
You have to remember.
Pender is in a perplexing situation.
It sounds so crazy to say.
You guys are going to think I'm drunk, but
I have to tell someone. I'm...
from a...
a different time. Another era.
The future. OK? I come...
from the 2000th millenium to here.
I get in a car, and I slide through time.
Exactly correct.
You inhabit two worlds.
- So far, I see nothing strange.
- Why?
Yeah, you're surrealists!
But I'm a normal guy.
See, in one life,
I'm engaged to marry a woman I love.
At least, I think I love her.
Christ! I better love her!
I'm marrying her!
The rhinoceros makes love
by mounting the female.
But...
is there a difference


                                 Page 34/54

in the beauty between two
rhinoceroses?
There is another woman?
Adriana. Yes, and I'm...
very drawn to her.
I find her extremely alluring.
The problem is that other men,
great artists - geniuses -
also find her alluring,
and she finds them.
So, there's that...
A man in love with a woman
from a different era.
I see a photograph.
I see a film.
I see an insurmountable problem.
I see...
...a rhinoceros.
Did you get any work done last night?
Yeah...I just....
I'm starting to think that maybe my
book is too realistic.
That I'm missing some chances
to let my imagination kind of
go crazy, and not be so
damn logical.
- Why do you always look so good in the morning?
- No. No. No. No!
- We have to get dressed!
- Just for a second!
Come here! I've been working like a demon.
I gotta get this stuff done, but
I can't resist you any more.
You're so fetching in the morning.
Paul said we have to go to the countryside.
You know? He said he's taking us
to this beautiful little inn for lunch.
But, I mean, if you don't want to go,
don't go.
I'm not missing it because of you.
Hello! Bonjour!
- Hello! I have a quick question for you about Rodin.
- Hello.
OK, now, I understand


                                 Page 35/54

he loved his wife
and he also loved his mistress.
- Yes.
- But do you think that's possible,
to love two women at once?
Well, he loved them both,
but in a different way.
You know...
That's very...
That's very French.
You guys are way...
you know...much...
more evolved in that department
than we are.
Do you remember me?
I was in the...
- was in the group that...
- Yes!
The group with the pedantic gentleman.
Pedantic? Yes.
That's a perfect word.
Here is ... his photo.
I want to know where
he goes each night.
What is your suspicion? Hm?
He's engaged to my daughter.
To marry. I want to make sure
that she's making the right decision.
Naturally, discretion is paramount.
Well, you've come to the
right place, Monsieur.
Monsieur Tisserant will personally
keep track of the gentleman,
and report about his whereabouts at night.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!
Hey! Thank you for stopping.
- Gil Pender.
- Tom Eliot.
Tom Eliot?
Tom Stearns Eliot?
T.S Eliot? T.S. Eliot?
- Pender.
- Prufrock's like my mantra!
OK. Sorry. Sorry.


                                 Page 36/54

Listen. Where I come from,
people measure out their lives
with coke spoons.
- Hello? Ms. Stein?
- Oh, Pender.
I'll get to your book in a moment.
I finished it.
We're just in the middle
of a little personal crisis.
Oh, OK. Should I come back?
I don't want to interrupt.
No, it's no secret.
Adriana has left Pablo,
and has flown to Africa with Hemingway.
Saba que tena obsesin con este fanfarrn!
(I knew that I had an obsession with that bully!)
Ya hemos hablado de todo esto!
(We talked about all this!)
Estoy segura de que ella regresar muy devoto.
(I'm sure that she'll come back very devoted.)
Muy devoto. Oh, he took her hunting kudu,
but she'll be back to him.
The sound of hyenas in your ears at night when
you're trying to sleep in a tent just drives you crazy.
Mount Kilimanjaro is not Paris.
- What are you saying, that he took her to Mount Kilimanjaro?
- Now, about your book,
it's very unusual, indeed.
I mean, in a way, it's almost like science fiction.
We all fear death,
and question our place in the universe.
The artist's job is not to succumb to despair,
but to find an antidote for
the emptiness of existence.
You have a clear and lively voice.
Don't be such a defeatist.
Tell Gil to bring his suit, 'cause we're
going to be dining formal tomorrow night.
I forgot to tell you, actually.
Gil isn't coming to Mont Saint-Michel.
Why not?
I don't understand it!
Because, he writes.
He rewrites.


                                 Page 37/54

He rewrites the rewrites, you know?
He says, ""Picasso never left his studio.""
I said, ""Gil, you have absolutely
nothing in common with Picasso.""
He just looks at me.
Well, he's gonna miss a great weekend.

You have any Cole Porter?
- Hi.
- Hey.
- I remember you.
- Yeah?
- He was your friend.
- Cole Porter? Yeah.
And don't forget about Linda.
She was a friend, too.
- You realize I was kidding?
- Yeah. I did realize.
You're a bit young.
Yeah. You seem a bit young
to be so familiar with his work.
It's because he wrote
many songs about Paris.
Yeah. What was the story? It was like he was
in love with your hometown, or something.
- Are you a Parisian?
- Yes, monsieur.
""Yes, monsieur."" Feel free to call me Gil.
- What do I owe you?
- For this?
- Dix-huit Euros. (18)
- OK.

Whoa! Oh my God!
What are you guys doing?
Daddy had chest pains.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. I'm sure it's just indigestion.
- We can't take that chance.


                                 Page 39/54

- You know he had an angioplasty 3 years ago.
Yeah. Right.
They put a balloon in me.
Big deal.
- Balloon?
- I would like the hotel doctor, please, in room 728.
Don't call the doctor!
Gil, why are you so dressed up?
Me? No, no, no, I'm not.
I've been writing.
I was just doing a little writing.
Wh...You dress up and
put on cologne to write?
No, no. I jumped in the shower,
just for a second. You know
how I think better in the shower,
and I get the positive ions going in there?
So, we were halfway to Mont Saint-Michel
when Daddy just...
he went pale as a ghost.
- That's terrible!
- I mean, it was so scary, so we just
- turned right around and came back.
- Yeah. You had to.
John, is there anything I can get,
for your color to me looks
- like it's OK, but I'm not a doctor.
- Naw, I'm fine.
I'm sure it's the
beef bourguignon she made me have.
- What is that?
- Where?
- That in your hand.
- Nothing.
- That was a present!
- I know. I know.
I mean, it's not...It...It is!
- Pour moi? (For me?)
- Yes.
It's not...incredible....
It's from the flea market.
- Well, can I open it?
- No, no no,
That's what I'm saying.


                                 Page 40/54

Honey, it's for a special dinner
that we're gonna have,
then I'm going to give it to you.
- Is it jewelry? I hope it's my taste, if it's jewelry, because...
- Well...
- ...that moonstone necklace?
- But I thought you liked the moon?
Because it's understated, but elegant.
That's what you always say.
Cheap is cheap,
is what I always say.
Yeah. You didn't see this necklace.
I've never actually even worn it.
I'll show you. You'll see why immediately.
- Everybody's down on moonstone, all of a sudden.
- Well...
- they are...
- A little simple.
I think... I thought
you loved their simplicity.
Yeah, that's the problem.
They're too simple.
Well, what do I know?
Too simple.
Where are my pearl earrings?
Did...Did you bring them?
I don't even remember you packing them.
Yes, I did, because I've worn them here!
No, you didn't.
Oh, they must've fallen out!
Both of them?
Gil, my ears are pierced.
Inez, I told you to keep
everything in the hotel safe!
- Do you think it was the maid?
- It's always the maid.
I...I know I saw them
here this morning.
Well, I would report the theft right away.
You know, she was so snotty
yesterday when I asked her...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's not
jump to any conclusions, OK?
- You don't just level a charge of theft against somebody.


                                 Page 41/54

- Yes, I'd like to report a theft.
- Shh, Inez, no!
- Could you call the house detective?
- Send him up. Thank you.
- This is turning into a witch hunt!
You don't do this to people!
Yes, you do,
if they've stolen.
I didn't like that maid.
I didn't like her from the beginning.
She was sweet. She was pleasant.
She was upbeat!
You always take the
side of the help, as usual!
That's why Daddy says you're a communist.
Bon soir. (Good evening.)
I'm Doctor Grard.
- Do you want some more water?
- I'm fine.
- He's had angioplasty.
- I didn't need it.
Look! Are these them?
I don't know.
- Where did you find them?
- They were just in the bathroom.
- In the bathroom?
- Yeah. On the sink.
What the hell were they
doing in the bathroom?
I don't know.
They were just...
But maybe you dropped them, and
when you were putting them away,
and the housekeeper must've picked them up.
and placed them there, out in
the open where we could see them easily.
That was really thoughtful of her.
I didn't drop them.
I wouldn't drop them.
The important thing is
they're not stolen.
C'est l'un de vos meilleurs, jusqu'au prsent.
(It's one of your best, until now.)
J'ai parl Leo. Je pense qu'il va l'acheter


                                 Page 42/54

(I talked to Leo. I think that he'll buy it.)
Oh, Pender!
I was just telling Matisse
we're going to buy one of his
paintings for our personal collection.
I think 500 Francs is fair.
Yeah, I think that sounds fair.
You know, I was wondering if
maybe I could pick up 6 or 7.
- What have we got here?
- Yeah. Oh.
OK, now, I've brought a rewrite over
of the first few chapters of my book,
and if you could just tell me if I'm
heading in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.
- Leave it with me.
- OK. Great.
and have you heard from Hemingway?
Oh, they've been back for days, now.
The trip didn't work out.
I knew they wouldn't hit it off.
It's over. With Picasso, too.
She's at Deyrolle, by herself.
By herself?
Oh, one of those crazy
Surrealist painters is getting married.
They're doing it up there.
She'll be glad to see you.
Eh bien, mes chers amies, je propose de porter un toast...
(Well, my dear friends, I propose to raise a toast to...)
Oh. What are you doing here?
I came to find you.
- You did?
- Yeah. Maybe this is coming out of left field, but
let's just say, as a writer,
I'm pretty good at
picking up on vibrations from people-
women in particular.
I sense that there are
some complicated feelings, maybe,
that you have for me.
Aren't you gonna get married?
Well, everything's a little
up in the air right now.


                                 Page 43/54

I don't know what is gonna happen.
Is there some place that we
can talk? Maybe more quiet?
- Sure.
- Come on.
Oh, Mr. Buuel!
I had a nice idea
for a movie for you.
- Yes?
- A group of people attend a
very formal dinner party. At the end of dinner,
when they try to leave the room, they can't.
Why not?
They just can't seem to exit the door.
- B...But why?
- Well, momento,
when they're forced to stay together,
the veneer of civilization
quickly fades away,
and what you're left with is
who they really are: animals.
But I don't get it.
Why don't they just
walk out of the room?
All I'm saying is just think about.
Who knows?
Maybe when you're shaving one day,
it'll tickle your fancy.
I don't understand.
What's holding them in the room?
What are you doing?
I don't know!
I did feel,
for a minute there,
while I was doing it, like I was immortal.
But you look so sad.
Because life is too mysterious.
This is the time we live in.
Everything moves so fast.
Life is noisy and complicated.
I've always been a logical person.
I've never
I never acted too crazy.
I didn't stay here.


                                 Page 44/54

When I first came out here,
I didn't take a real shot at being a writer.
I'd just, kind of, be a hired Hollywood hand.
Don't laugh. I just want to...
I feel like I just want to let it go.
- Here.
- Oh!
Oh! This is...
This is remarkable!
Go on. Here, put in on.
They're so beautiful!
Look!
Monsieur, Mademoiselle, on y va!
(Sir, Miss, away we go!)
- Qui est vous? (Who are you?)
- Allez monter. Nous allons trop tard. (Come up. We're too late)
- Allez!
- Come on! Come on!
Oh, mon Dieu,
this is so beautiful!
It's unbelievable!
All the pictures I've seen...

Here it is:
Wow! I don't know
what it is about this city!
It's like, I've got to write a note
to the Chamber of Commerce.
Bon soir!
(Good evening!)
Bon soir! Bienvenue.
(Good evening! Welcome.)
Thank you.
Oh, mon Dieu! Quelle robe magnifique!
(Oh, my God! What a magnificent dress!)
Tellement avant-garde!
(So ahead of the time!)
S'il vous plat, prenez un boire du champagne. C'est la fte!
(Please, have a drink of champagne. It's a party!)
Champagne.
Isn't it amazing? The first time we met,
I told you about this place,
and the Belle poque,
and here we are!


                                 Page 45/54

I don't know why,
but I have this feeling that...
I don't know, like I can't...
believe my luck.
Well, I can. I know exactly where I want to go next.
You lead the way.
Look!
Oh, my God!
Pablo admires him so much!
- I have to say hello.
- No, maybe we shouldn't bother him.
- Come with me! I'm nervous.
- Really? OK.
But, we know he's a lonely man.
- I'm sure he would love some company.
- OK, let's go.
Monsieur Lautrec?
- Oui? (Yes?)
- Bon soir. Nous sommes de grands amateurs.(Good evening. We are great
fans.)
- Merci, Madame. (Thank you, Madame.)
- Pouvons-nous vous offrir un verre? (May we offer you a drink?)
Je serais enchante. Prenez un sige.
(I would be delighted. Have a seat.)
He's asking us to sit down with him.
This much French I do
understand, and the gesture.
Vous tes Americain?
(You are American?)
Yes, I'm an American.
Je vous devine l'accent.(I could tell from the accent.)
- Yeah. Oui. Oui.
Vos dessins! Votre attention! Nous admirons tout que vous faites.
(Your drawings! Your attention! We admire everything that you do.)
- I love your drawings, also.
- Bon soir!
- Merci.
Savez que moi je prsenter Monsieur Gauginand Monsieur Degas.
(May I present Mr. Gaugin and Mr. Degas.)
- Bon soir.
- Enchante.
- Bon soir. Enchante.
- Paul Gaugin.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!


                                 Page 46/54

See the sketch he's made?
Nobody can draw like this today.
Not Picasso. Not Matisse.
Unbelievable. Parlez-vous anglais?
- Non, monsieur. (No, sir.)
- Il parle un petit peu.(He speaks a little.)
Non, non. I speak well. Parle trs bien. Bien oui. Tu veut voir?
(No, no. I speak very well. Absolutely. You want to see?)
Degas and I were just
talking about how this...
um...this...cette...gnration est plus vide, et il manque d'imagination.
(...this generation is empty, and is missing imagination.)
He said...He says that
this generation is empty,
and has no imagination.
Better to have lived during the...
la Renaissance.
No! This is the golden age.
- Non.
- C'est l'ge d'or!(It's the golden age!)
Pas de tout. La Renaissance, c'est beaucoup mieux.
(Not at all. The Renaissance is much better.)
Qu'est-ce que vous faites dans la vie?
(What is it you do?)
J'tudie la haute-couture.
(I study high fashion.)
C'est pour a vous tes (That's why you're dressed like that.)
Je comprends maintenant!
(I understand now!)
Les vtements tres jeune.
(The youthful clothes.)
Voulez vous de lui prsenter Richard?
(Would you introduce her to Richard?)
- Ah, oui! (Oh, yes!)
- Ah, oui. He wants to have you meet his friend Richard.
He's looking for someone
to do costumes for the new ballet.
So, vous intresse?
(So, you're interested?)
- Ballet costumes?
- Yes.
Oh my God! I...
I don't live here.
I mean, I do, but I don't. I...


                                 Page 47/54

It's best not to go
into too many details. We're...
We're temporarily
passing through.
Can I speak with you a minute?
Permite?
(May I?)
Enchant..
Wow, it didn't take
Gaugin long to start steaming in.
Let's never go back to the '20s!
- What are you talking about?
- We should stay here.
It's the start of La Belle poque!
It's the greatest, most
beautiful era Paris has ever known.
Yeah, but about the '20s,
and the Charleston,
and the Fitzgeralds,
and the Hemingways?
I mean, I love those guys.
But it's the present.
It's dull.
Dull?
It's not my present.
I'm from 2010.
What do you mean?
I dropped in on you the same way
we're dropping in on the 1890s.
You did?
I was trying to escape my present
the same way you're trying to escape yours,
to a golden age.
Surely you don't think
the '20s are a golden age!
Well, yeah. To me they are.
But I'm from the '20s, and I'm
telling you the golden age is La Belle poque.
And look at these guys. I mean, to them,
their golden age was the Renaissance.
You know, they're trade Belle poque
to be painting alongside
Titian and Michelango.
And those guys probably imagined


                                 Page 48/54

life was a lot better
when Kublai Khan was around.
You see, I'm having an insight right now.
It's a minor one, but
it explains the anxiety in my dream that I had.
- What dream?
- I had a dream the other night, where
it was like a nightmare,
where I ran out of Zithromax.
And then I went to the dentist,
and he didn't have any Novocaine.
You see what I'm saying?
These people don't have any antibiotics.
What are you talking about?
Adriana, if you stay here,
and this becomes your present,
then, pretty soon, you'll start
imagining another time was really your,
you know, was really the golden time.
That's what the present is.
That it's a little unsatisfying,
because life's a little unsatisfying.
That's the problem with writers.
You are so full of words.
But I am more emotional,
and I'm going stay,
and live in Paris' most glorious time.
You made a choice to leave
Paris once, and you regretted it.
Yeah, I did regret it.
It was a bad decision,
but at least it was a choice.
I mean, it was a real choice.
This way, I think, is,
I don't know, crazy.
It doesn't really work.
If I ever want to write
something worthwhile, I have to,
you know, get rid of my
illusions, and then I'd be
happier in the past,
as where I want a home.
So...
Goodbye, Gil?


                                 Page 49/54

Goodbye.
Pender, I read your rewrite,
and you're nicely on the right track.
You understood me clearly.
If the rest of the book
reads as well when you're done,
- you'll have something of value.
- That is the best news!
I really did listen to you,
so I'm happy to hear that it
You know, it seems like I'm
moving forward.
I mean, it just means
the world to me that you
- Hemingway read the chapters, too, and he thinks...
- He read it?
...he thinks it's going to be a fine book.
but he did have one plot suggestion.
What's the suggestion?
Well, he doesn't quite believe
that the protagonist
doesn't see that his fiance is
having an affair right before his eyes.
- With?
- The other character. The pedantic one.
That's called denial.
Thank you.
You're crazy!
Paul and I?
Where did you get such an insane notion?
Where? From Ernest Hemingway.
He figured it out, and, guess what,
it makes perfect sense.
Gil, your brain tumor's acting up again.
- No. No!
- There's nothing crazy about Hemingway,
or Fitzgerald, or Gertrude Stein,
or Salvador Dal!
Yeah, except that they've been dead for years!
No, no. The past is not dead.
Actually, it's not even past.
You know who said that?
Faulkner. And he was right.
And I met him, too.


                                 Page 50/54

I ran into him at a dinner party.
- You're a raving lunatic!
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- No. I'm too trusting.
I'm jealous,
and I'm trusting.
It's cognitive dissonance.
- Scott Fitzgerald talked about it.
- Gil. Gil.
Inez, you can fool me,
but you cannot fool Hemingway.
- I know.
- Jesus Christ, I'm dealing with a madman here.
OK. Yes! I did.
I was with Paul for a few nights,
because he's romantic,
and he speaks French,
and you were always working, and maybe it's
the mystique of this corny city, but...
get over it, Gil.
You just put this in perspective
when we get home.
I'm not...I'm not going back.
- I'm sorry. What?
- I'm staying here, and it has nothing to do with,
you know, your romantic fling;
Paris is Paris.
Inez, you and I, it's obvious we're not...
I don't think we're right for each other.
What?
What are you saying?
What are you even talking about?
- You ready to go swimming?
- Hi!
We're breaking up.
- What?
- Yeah. Gil's moving to Paris.
- I knew it. I told you.
- What's going on?
No, no, I'm going to stay in Paris, but
just because we're...
If I'm unhappy, I'll move back.
But for the time being, yes.


                                 Page 51/54

W...W...With who?...
With who, Gil?
- No one, I...
- One of your crazy hallucinatory friends?
I mean, Mom's right about you.
You have this part missing.
Yeah, I said that first.
Anyone whose protagonist
makes a living
selling old cap pistols
and Joan Crawford cutout books...
- Honestly...
- Look, I'm not trying to be
a martyr, but I think
you'll be better off without me.
- I really do.
- But we would!
- I can't believe you're moving.
- Go ahead. Go ahead!
Walk the streets. Gush over the
Parisian light and the rooftops.
Goodbye, Inez.
- Say hi to Trotsky.
- Yeah.
- Unbelievable!
- You know, I had...
a private detective follow him.
I knew he was up to no good.
- You did?
- You bet I did.
He saw him get into a car
at midnight every night,
and he followed him very closely.
- And what happened?
- I don't know.
The detective agency says
the detective is missing.
qui dois-je l'honneur?
(To whom do I owe the honor?)
Je...Je suis perdu.
(I...I'm lost.)
J'ai detourne la mauvaise endroit.
(I made a wrong turn.)
Gardes! Gardes!


                                 Page 52/54

(Guards! Guards!)
Lui coupe la tte!
(Off with his head!)
Lui coupe la tte!
(Off with his head!)
- Hey! Hi!
- Hey!
Wow! What...
Good to see you.
What are you doing here?
I'm returning from dinner with friends.
- Oh. OK.
- I live here.
And you? What are you doing here?
I was just out for a walk.
Yeah, I'm actually...I decided.
I'm moving to Paris.
- Really? Wow. I'm sure you will love it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. You think so?
- Yeah.
You know, I thought about
you the other day.
- Really?
- Yeah, because
my boss got a whole
new album of Cole Porter songs.
That made you think about me?
I like to be thought of that way.
You're on your way home right now?
Yes.
Can I walk with you,
or, I'll buy you a cup of coffee?
Oh, OK, now it's starting to rain.
No, but that's OK.
I don't mind getting wet.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Actually, Paris is the most beautiful in the rain.
I feel that's what
I'm always saying.
I couldn't agree more with you.
Yes, it is more beautiful.
By the way, my name is Gabrielle.


                                 Page 53/54

- Gil.
- Nice to meet you.
That's a pretty name.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - EARLY MORNING

CAMERA (STEADICAM) holds on a man in a suit, sitting behind a
desk, on the phone: BARRY EGAN.

                    BARRY
          ...yes I'm still on hold...

                    OPERATOR
          And what was this?

                    BARRY
          I'm looking at your advertisement
          for the airline promotion and
          giveaway?

                    OPERATOR
          This is ""Fly With Us?""

                    BARRY
          It's hard to understand because it
          says in addition to but I can't
          exactly understand in addition to
          what because there's actually
          nothing to add it too...

                    OPERATOR
          I think that's a type-o then, that
          would be a mistake.

                    BARRY
          So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten
          purchases of any of your Healthy
          Choice products equals five hundred
          miles and then with the coupon the
          same purchases would value one
          thousand miles --

                       OPERATOR
          That's it.

                    BARRY
          Do you realize that the monetary
          value of this promotion and the
          prize is potentially worth more
          than the purchases?

                                                         2.



                    OPERATOR
          I don't know...I mean: I don't
          know.

OC DISTANT SOUND OF A CAR SKIDDING TO A STOP, SOME VAGUE,
DISTANT SCREAMING IS HEARD...THEN SILENCE. Barry hears this,
gets distracted, then back to the phone call;

                    BARRY
          Can I call you back if I have any
          further questions...? Can I get
          your extension?

                    OPERATOR
          It's extension 215 if you want to
          try me back.

                    BARRY
          Ok. Thank you.

He hangs up the phone and walks through his warehouse. It's
fairly non-descript place, boxing materials, etc. Products
seem to be mainly silly novelties (pens that light up, key
chains, novelty toilet plungers, etc)

He lifts a LOADING DOOR and LIGHT POURS INSIDE, WASHES OUT
THE FRAME....he's silhouette....CAMERA follows him
out...stays overexposed and over his shoulder as he looks
down towards the street.....

...his business is situated at the end of a common driveway,
shared with a few other nondescript places and an Auto
mechanic....distant SOUND of a car SPEEDING and SKIDDING....

....hold, then:

....a JEEP CHEROKEE comes FLIPPING into FRAME, far off at the
mouth of the alley, on the street. The JEEP ends up landing
RIGHT SIDE UP....HOLD....

.....Barry flinches a little, stares.....the JEEP sits idle
for a moment....then it drives off....then:

A speeding, small TOYOTA comes into view at the mouth of the
alley, screeching to a halt. The passenger side door opens
and a small, wooden HARMONIUM (like a portable organ) is
placed on the ground. The TOYOTA speeds away.....

....a moment or two later another NON-DESCRIPT CAR flies past
very fast....

BEAT. Barry squints, looks at the small HARMONIUM sitting
alone in the middle of the street.

                                                        3.



He hesitates, looks around, holds, then walks back inside his
warehouse.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

Barry on the phone again;

                    BARRY
          ....I'm not exactly sure what that
          means...

                    VOICE
          If they break or something. What is
          it, plastic?

                    BARRY
          It's a plastic, yeah.

                    VOICE
          Right. Alright, lemme call you
          first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run
          the numbers, see what's what and
          I'll give you a call back --

                    BARRY
          Did you have my home phone number?

                      VOICE
          For what?

                    BARRY
          If you wanted to call me back I
          could...

                    VOICE
          I'm fine, I have your work number.

                    BARRY
          Ok...because of the time difference
          if you needed to call me early?

                    VOICE
          It's fine. I can just get you at
          your office.

                      BARRY
          Ok.

                    VOICE
          Ok, bye, bye.

                                                        4.



                    BARRY
          Bye.

He hangs up the phone and walks outside, CAMERA follows him
again, out to the alley, over his shoulder......he looks down
the length of the alley at the Harmonium. HOLD, THEN:

A small FORD ESCORT pulls into the driveway, around the
Harmonium, parks......a young woman named LENA LEONARD exits
the car and starts to walk down the length of the alley
towards him.....CAMERA stays over his shoulder and turns into
a profile 2-shot;

                    LENA
          Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?

                    BARRY
          No.

                    LENA
          They're not open yet?

                    BARRY
          They don't get opened until eight.

BEAT. Barry gently steps back and out of the FRAME.

                    LENA
          Is it ok if I leave my car you
          think?

                    BARRY
          I don't know.

                     LENA
          I thought they opened at seven.
              (beat)
          If I left my car would it be ok?

                    BARRY
          I don't know.

                    LENA
          Do you know them.

                    BARRY
          Not very well.

                    LENA
          Can I ask you, can I trust to leave
          my keys with you and give them to
          you so that when they get here you
          could give them to them?

                                                           5.



                       BARRY
          Ok.

                    LENA
          You think it's ok where I left it,
          right there?

                    BARRY
          I think that'll be fine.

Lena hands him her keys, he steps back into FRAME, THEN:

                    LENA
          There's a piano in the street.

                       BARRY
          Yeah.

BEAT.

                    LENA
          Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank
          you for your help.

                       BARRY
          Thank you.

                    LENA
          Maybe I'll see you later, when I
          pick up my car?

                       BARRY
          Ok.

She walks away....he starts back inside the warehouse,
hesitates, watches her go.....right before she reaches the
end of the alley, she glances back quickly, over her
shoulder....he dodges inside real quick.....

HOLD THE EMPTY FRAME......then he steps back out.....looks
off at the Harmonium.....and the empty street.....he looks
around some more....then he makes the long walk down the
street.

ON THE STREET.

Barry stares at the Harmonium a little bit, looks around,
both ways, then casually picks it up and walks back towards
his business.....

He brings it into his office and places it on his desk. He
tries a few keys....pressing down...there's no sound.

                                                         6.



He presses his hand on the foot pedal and presses a key and a
small note is made.....BEAT....he does it again....and holds
the note.....

                                             CUT TO BLACK.

INT. WAREHOUSE - OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

Barry enters the warehouse with harmonium and runs into his
office. He places it on the desk and hits a key: no sound.

Barry goes to his knees and unlatched the bellows. He pumps
the bellow, reaches up, presses a note, and another...then
stands up into CU. and presses the 5 note
melody......SUDDENLY: THE SOUND OF THE POD BAY DOOR
SLIDING....

....Barry spins around, scared shitless, sees: LANCE, who
enters the warehouse, Barry rushes out to greet him;

                    LANCE
          Hey, good morning, Barry.

                    BARRY
          Hey...Lance....can I.....

                    LANCE
          You ok?

                    BARRY
          Yes I'm fine.

                    LANCE
          Why you wearin' a suit?

                    BARRY
          Um....I bought one. I thought maybe
          it would be nice to get dressed for
          work, can I show you something?

                    LANCE
          Yeah.....you got here early huh?

                    BARRY
          ....yes.....

They enter into the office, Lance sees the harmonium;

                    LANCE
          What is this?

                                                           7.



                    BARRY
          I don't know. I think it's a
          piano....a small piano.

                    LANCE
          That's not a piano.....I have a
          piano at home.....where'd you get
          it?

Lance walks around behind the harmonium....leaving Barry
alone....towards the warehouse......he starts to back up a
little.....

                    BARRY
          Well.....it was dropped on the
          street.....

Sal, Ernesto and Rico all start to come into work behind
Barry.....he sees them: CAMERA pushes in on Barry....

                    LANCE (OC)
          Why is it here? Barry....Barry?

                    BARRY
          ...it just....I don't know....I
          don't know.

LAND IN CU. ON BARRY. CUT TO BLACK.

INT. WAREHOUSE/MAIN AREA - DAY

CAMERA pushes in slow as Barry and Lance talk to TWO
CUSTOMERS about the plungers which are on display in front of
them. They speak all over each other doing shop talk, etc;

                    CUSTOMER
          You do guaranteed sale? etc.

                    BARRY
          We back our plungers 100% and we do
          ask for a 30 to 60 day display on
          the floor.....

In the b.g., RICO over the laud speaker says:

                    RICO
          Barry, your sister's on line one.

Barry doesn't move....

                                                        8.



                    BARRY
          Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60
          days....

                    CUSTOMER
          I think you have a call?

Rico turns around, without loudspeaker;

                    RICO
          Barry, your sister is on line one.

They look at him a moment....

                    BARRY
          I'm just gonna grab this call real
          quick?

ANGLE, REVERSE. Barry turns and heads for the phone nearby at
Rico's station;

                    BARRY (CONT'D)
              (into phone)
          .....This is Barry.

                    RHONDA
          Hey it's me, it's Rhonda. Are you
          coming to the party tonight?

                    BARRY
          Hi, Rhonda, yes I am.

                    RHONDA
          Bye.

She hangs up.

                    BARRY
          Ok. Yes I'll see you tonight.

Barry takes a few steps back to the Customers:

                    BARRY (CONT'D)
          Sorry about that: One thing I
          wanted to point out, Dave, is that
          we've just received a large order
          from the Rio Hotel and Casino in
          Las Vegas where we're going to be
          supplying their hotel rooms with
          the dice and money plunger, so
          these babies are really moving well
          right now...

                                                9.

          Barry, your sister's on line two.
          Barry tries again to ignore it....

                    BARRY
          With the Aqua Blast Whales and
          Speed Boats we're gonna ask for a
          display at eye level for the little
          kids.....

                     RICO
          Barry --

                    BARRY
          -- excuse me.

Barry walks back to the phone;

                    BARRY (CONT'D)
          This is Barry.

                    KAREN
          Hey it's me, what are you doing?

                    BARRY
          Hello, Karen. I'm just working.

                    KAREN
          Yeah but what are you doing?

                    BARRY
          I'm just working....I have some
          customers here.....

                    KAREN
          So you can't talk to me?

                    BARRY
          I have a few people here, I can't
          really chat right now.

                    KAREN
          ""chat?"" Did you just say ""chat?""

                    BARRY
          Well, I can't talk though --

                    KAREN
          You just fucking said ""chat,"" that
          is so -- what are you now?
                    (MORE)

                                                       10.
                    KAREN (CONT'D)
          ""chat."" I'm just calling to make
          sure you show up at this party
          tonight.

                    BARRY
          Yes, I'll be there.

                    KAREN
          Fine. You get back to chatting with
          your precious customers.

                    BARRY
          Ok, bye-bye.

Barry snaps out of this, turns, claps his hands in confidence
and walks back to the customers and says:

                    BARRY (CONT'D)
          Sorry about that.

                    CUSTOMER
          I didn't know you had a sister?

                     BARRY
          .....Well yes I do....
              (beat)
          But one more thing I wanted to tell
          you guys about the new plungers is
          that we're making the handles now
          in a non-breakable material
          called.....

He takes one of the plungers and to demonstrate smacks it on
the table....it SMASHES and rice falls out everywhere....

                    BARRY (CONT'D)
          Ok...this is one of the old ones, I
          think. Lance do we have any new
          plungers around?

Lance moves to get a new plunger....

                    BARRY (CONT'D)
          That was a little embarrassing and
          that was one of the old handles so
          let me get a new one to show you --

                    RICO
              (loudspeaker)
          Barry, your sister is on line one.

Barry holds, then;

                                                       11.



                    CUSTOMER
          How many sisters do you have?

                    BARRY
          ....I have seven.

                    CUSTOMER #2
          Holy shit. You have seven sisters?

                    BARRY
          They're calling because we're
          having a party tonight for my
          sister and the they're just
          calling....can you hang on for just
          two more minutes....?

Barry walks this time into his office......CAMERA tracks with
Barry to his office, seeing him try and shake this off.....He
EXITS FRAME.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

Barry enters, takes a quick moment to size up the
harmonium.....He picks up the phone and through the
conversation gently moves the harmonium to a different spot
on the desk;

          Right now, you're doing nothing?

                                      12.



          BARRY

Barry plays the 5 note melody on the Harmonium (carries over
into next scene....)

INT./EXT. WAREHOUSE - LATER (BRIDGE/BREAK MUSIC WISE)

Barry and his workers are having lunch. A LUNCH TRUCK is
parked by the driveway. Barry sees the CAR that Lena brought
by at the start of the movie....OC CALL from one of the
workers;

                    WORKER
          Telephone Barry on line one.

A mechanic passes by at this moment, keeps walking past;

                    BARRY
          What's wrong with her car?

                       MECHANIC
          Wha?

                    BARRY
          Is that car gonna be ok?

                       MECHANIC
          It's fine.

The mechanic keeps walking....Barry enters.

INT. WAREHOUSE/NEAR LANCE'S DESK - LATE AFTERNOON

Barry and the boys are prepping some boxes for shipping.
Ernesto walks over, says;

                    ERNESTO
          Barry, your sister's here.

Barry stands up fast, stumbles back a bit over some boxes,
recovers, ELIZABETH enters:

                    ELIZABETH
          Hey, how are you?

                    BARRY
          I'm fine, hi, how are you?

                    ELIZABETH
          I'm just stopping by to say hello.

                    BARRY
          Hello.

                    ELIZABETH
          So you're coming tonight, right?

                    BARRY
          Yes, indeed, yes I am.

                    ELIZABETH
          There's this girl, this friend of
          mine from work that I think is
          really cute and really cool and I
          want you to meet her so I was
          thinking about bringing her to the
          party tonight.

                    BARRY
          Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.

                    ELIZABETH
          Why?

                     BARRY
          Well I don't want to do something
          like that.

                    ELIZABETH
          She's my friend and you should meet
          her. You'd like her.

                    BARRY
          Yeah, but please don't do that.

                                      15.



          ELIZABETH
I'm not really asking you, I'm
telling you.

          BARRY
Yeah but please don't do that:
everyone would be looking at me.

          ELIZABETH
It's a free country, we can look at
you if we want to.

          BARRY
Yes but I get tense and I feel like
I can't be myself if that happens.

          ELIZABETH
That's your fault not mine.

          BARRY
I don't think I'm going to the
party.

          ELIZABETH
So it's ok if I bring her.

          BARRY
Please don't.

          ELIZABETH
She's really cute and she's really
nice.

          BARRY
...please, I just don't want it....

           ELIZABETH
....wait a minute: why is this
about you now? Why is it always
about you?

          BARRY
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --

          ELIZABETH
I'm trying to be your friend.

          BARRY
I know.

          ELIZABETH
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.

                                                         16.



                    BARRY
          Well, yeah, thank you, but --

                    ELIZABETH
          -- but since you're not going I
          guess none of this matters and I'll
          bring her anyway.

BEAT. HOLD. She stares him down.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          All I'm trying to do is be your
          friend.

She leaves. HOLD ON BARRY. He air punches/twitch.

INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER/BLUE HOUR - NIGHT

Barry is alone, closing up. He takes a look at the Harmonium
and presses it, makes a sound....a little bit more....makes a
few notes. END SCORE QUE as it blends and fades into the
notes that Barry plays.

BEAT. He closes its small cover, does something on his desk
and then:

His face gets bright red, he holds back tears, opens his
mouth and has a serious but small burst of overwhelming
emotion and then it's over.

INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT


CU. BIRTHDAY CARD.

Barry's hands reaches in and picks a birthday card.


ANGLE, WIDER, THAT MOMENT.

Barry grabs the card and starts to push his cart....but he
pushes it straight into a SIX YEAR OLD KID who's pushing a
cart around....they slam into each other....

Barry apologizes....the KID just takes off....Barry's cart
now has a slightly damaged wheel that wobbles like crazy....

                                                       17.

BARRY'S POV - THE BOX

Slow zoom in. The sticker reads: ""Fly Away With Us! The More

towards some SOUP. He grabs one, inspects it.....then puts it
back.

It's put back on the shelf: TILT down to price: 79 cents.
Barry turns his cart around and SMACKS right into someone
else again, screwing up another wheel on his cart. ANGLE,

comes across: PUDDING. The price: 4/$1.00.

MED. BARRY in the middle of the aisle. He
reacts......smiles...holds....thinks....looks around, then
starts to load up on the pudding.


ANGLE, BARRY.

He pushes TWO SHOPPING CARTS FULL OF PUDDING over to the
STORE MANAGER who's on his knees, stacking milk.....Barry
kneels down, CAMERA PUSHES INTO A CU. as he speaks sotto;

                       MANAGER
          Hello.

                    BARRY
          Hello, sir. My name is Barry Egan
          and I'd like to ask if you have any
          more Healthy Choice pudding in the

INT. SUSAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The door opens slowly and Barry peers his head around and
into the house very cautiously, CAMERA PUSHES IN and PANS
slightly LEFT to reveal: THE KITCHEN.

Barry's SEVEN SISTERS are all there, preparing dinner and
talking away....they turn and see him;

                    SUSAN
          There he is! Do you remember when
          we used to call you gay and you'd
          get all mad?

                    KATHLEEN
          -- we were calling you gay and you
          got so mad that you threw a hammer
          through the sliding glass door --
          do you remember?

                    BARRY
          I don't really remember that.

                    KATHLEEN
          Yes you do. We were calling you Gay
          Boy and you got so mad....

                    BARRY
          Yes, yes, right.

                    SUSAN
          We're trying to remember why you
          had the hammer in the first place?

                       BARRY
          ...um.....

                    KATHLEEN
          The hammer that you threw....why
          did you have it?

                    SUSAN
          You don't remember -- you had the
          hammer and you threw it -- ?

                    BARRY
          I remember, yes.....

                    SUSAN
          Why did you have it?

Another sister, RHONDA, enters from behind, Barry jumps,
says:

                                                       19.



                    RHONDA
          He was building a ramp for the dog.

                    KATHLEEN
          He was making a ramp for the dog!
          That's right!

                    SUSAN
          That's right....ramp for the
          dog..... And you just threw the
          hammer.

                    BARRY
              (to Rhonda)
          Happy Birthday, Rhonda.

                    RHONDA
          Thank you. Thank you so much,
          Barry.

She gives him a very quick hug and kiss and sets the cake
next to a bigger, cooler looking cake.

Mia approaches holding a baby.....Barry tries to say hello to
the baby, but Mia slowly turns the baby out of Barry's
grasp....making herself the center of his attention;

KITCHEN/DINING ROOM, THAT MOMENT

Barry gets slightly turned around trying to reach the
baby...and ends up in a doorway that leads to the dining
room, revealing himself to: ELIZABETH, KAREN, NICOLE AND
ANNA. There are also: THREE BROTHER IN LAW'S (WALTER, LARRY
AND STEVE)

                    ELIZABETH
          Hey....I was just telling everyone
          about how I was gonna bring this
          girl for you but you wouldn't let
          me do it.

                    BARRY
          Hello everyone.

KAREN steps up and greets him;

                    KAREN
          Did you think that we'd all be
          looking at you?

                    BARRY
          No, no, no.

                                                       20.



                    KAREN
          Well it's just not true. We
          wouldn't be looking at you -- why
          are you wearing this suit? Did you
          say hello to your brother in law's?

                    STEVE/LARRY
          Hi, Barry. How ya doin? Good, good.

                    KAREN
          Say hello to them, that's right,
          good, good. Ok. Come on, we're
          gonna eat now.....let's go.....

Barry shakes hands and hello's with the brother in law's.
He's left alone for a moment with Walter and Elizabeth;

                    WALTER
          How you doin' Barry?

                       BARRY
          Hi Walter.

                    WALTER
          How's business?

                    BARRY
          Business is very food, thanks.

                    ELIZABETH
          What's very food?

                       BARRY
          What?

                    ELIZABETH
          You just said very food.

                    BARRY
          Did I say that?

                       WALTER
          Yeah.

                    BARRY
          That was weird. I meant good.

                    WALTER
          Maybe you said that because you're
          hungry.....

Walter moves to help everyone...they're moving to set the
table......

                                                       21.



CAMERA CLOSES IN ON BARRY AND ELIZABETH alone for a beat:

                    ELIZABETH
          You're lucky. She couldn't come
          anyway --

                    BARRY
          Well I'm glad you didn't, thank
          you.

                    ELIZABETH
          She couldn't come I said. Are you
          nervous?

                    BARRY
          No.

                    ELIZABETH
          You look nervous.

                    BARRY
          I'm not, I'm very happy.

RHONDA passes;

                    RHONDA
          Come on homo-boy, we're eating now.

Elizabeth leaves, HOLD ON BARRY.


CAMERA PUSHES IN TOWARDS EVERYONE SETTING THE

TABLE.....CAMERA ROTATES AROUND.....everyone is still
chatting a bit about ""Barry gay boy,"" and ""the girl that was
gonna be here that Barry wouldn't allow.""

ANGLE, REVERSE. Barry is standing in front of the floor to
ceiling sliding glass doors.....in an INSTANT, he TURNS AND
THROWS HIS FIST STRAIGHT THROUGH THREE OF THEM, THEY
SHATTER....he turns back, they are all staring straight at
him in silence. HOLD, THEN:

In unison they all go ape shit:

                    GROUP
          WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM.
          GODDAMNIT BARRY. YOU FUCKIN'
          MANIAC.
          ETC. ETC.

INT. SUSAN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER

It's later and WALTER and BARRY walk down a small hall and
into a kids room. They're OC for a few moments as the CAMERA
slowly pushes in and towards the room. Following sotto;

                       WALTER
          What's up?

                    BARRY
          Well I'm sorry. Before...

                       WALTER
          Mhm.

                    BARRY
          And I'm sorry that I did that.

                    WALTER
          It's alright.

                    BARRY
          I wanted to ask you because you're
          a doctor, right?

                       WALTER
          Yeah.

                     BARRY
          I don't like the way I am
          sometimes.
              (beat)
          Can you help me?

                    WALTER
          Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of
          help do you think I can give you?

                    BARRY
          I know that. Maybe you know other
          doctors?

                    WALTER
          Like a psychiatrist?

                    BARRY
          I don't have anyone to talk to
          things about and I understand it's
          confidential with a doctor - I'm
          embarrassed about that and I don't
          want my sisters to know?

                                                        23.



                    WALTER
          You want a number for a
          psychiatrist, I can get you one,
          that's not a problem. but what
          exactly is wrong?

                    BARRY
          I don't know if there's anything
          wrong with me because I don't know
          how other people are.....Sometimes
          I cry a lot.....for no reason.

Barry starts to cry. Walter just stares at his. HOLD.

Barry stops, recuperates, then leaves.....as he does;

                    BARRY (CONT'D)
          Please don't tell my sisters.

        Not very late.

                  SEXY VOICE
        You're going to work now?

                  BARRY
        Yes.

                  SEXY VOICE
        Can I ask you a question?

                  BARRY
        Uh-huh.

                   SEXY VOICE
        Remember last night I was talking
        to you and I was telling you about
        my apartment, my rent -- ?
            (beat)
        Do you remember?

                  BARRY
        Yes.

                   SEXY VOICE
        This is really weird and really
        embarrassing for me but....uh....

                                                32.
                    SEXY VOICE (CONT'D)
          I was wondering if you could help
          me out with a little bit of money.

                    BARRY
          Me?

                    SEXY VOICE
          Yeah.

                    BARRY
          I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I
          can't afford it.

                    SEXY VOICE
          You don't even know how much it is.

                    BARRY
          I know but I....how much is it?

                    SEXY VOICE
          Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred
          fifty?

                    BARRY
          Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't
          afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.

                    SEXY VOICE
          Really? Please?

                    BARRY
          You have trouble, financial
          trouble?

                    SEXY VOICE
          Yeah. It's so hard these days and I
          really need it.

                    BARRY
          Yes I can't....I don't make enough
          money to be able to do that.

                    SEXY VOICE
          I thought you had your own
          business. You said you were gonna
          diversify and all that stuff....

BEAT. Barry steps back a little....

                    SEXY VOICE (CONT'D)
          So you think you can?

                    BARRY
          No. I'm sorry.

                                                       33.



                    SEXY VOICE
          Should I call back and talk to your
          girlfriend?

                    BARRY
          ....what....?

                    SEXY VOICE
          I was wondering if it's better to
          ask your girlfriend for the money?
          It could be really easy. I mean, I
          have all your information, credit
          card information and billing stuff -
          -

Barry hangs up the phone real fast. HOLD. He doesn't move.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S WORK/WAREHOUSE - MORNING/LATER

CAMERA (HAND HELD) behind Barry, as he walks through the
warehouse, greets the boys, says hello to Lance, etc. Lance,
taking his cue from Barry, is a bit more dressed up today....

                    LANCE
          Good morning, Barry....

                       BARRY
          Hi, Lance.

                    LANCE
          What's with all this pudding, what
          is this?

CAMERA sees that all the pudding Barry bought has been
stacked neatly in a corner. Barry stops dead in his tracks to
explain;

                    BARRY
          That's part of a very interesting
          airline promotion giveaway that's
          really tremendous. I'm going to
          start a collection of pudding and
          coupons that can be redeemed for
          frequent flyer miles through
          Healthy Choice and American
          Airlines --

                    LANCE
          You're goin' on a trip?

                                                       34.



                    BARRY
          No.........but airline miles are
          just like a currency these days.

                    LANCE
          You should go on a trip.

                       BARRY
          No thanks.

                    LANCE
          So what should I do with the
          pudding?

                    BARRY
          Let's just leave it there for now.

Barry goes into his office and looks at the Harmonium. BEAT.
He presses some keys, makes a little more noise with it. (a
quarter of some sort of melody starts here...)

ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.

Barry is cutting up his CREDIT CARD with some scissors. He
throws it away.

ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.

Barry paces around a little bit.....CAMERA stays inside and
watches him as he walks outside for a moment, looks
around....he sees something outside, hesitates, then dodges
back inside the warehouse --

-- once inside, he takes a horrendous, hurtful fall over
something....He stands up quick;

                    BARRY
          This is not supposed to be here.
          Seriously. Carlos, Carlos, this is
          really not supposed to be here. I
          don't mean to be a dick; but that's
          gonna hurt someone. It already did
          hurt someone: It hurt me, so please
          let's move that.

He backs away, then steps OUT OF FRAME...a moment later
ELIZABETH (his sister) and LENA (from the opening) enter the
warehouse, walking towards Barry;

                                                          35.



                    ELIZABETH
              (to Lena)
          He's wearing a suit again, I don't
          know why he's wearing a suit, he
          doesn't usually dress like that --

                       LENA
          It's fine.

CAMERA pushes in towards LENA and blends to 30fps...she
smiles, looks ahead, CAMERA slowly pans a 180 around to
become her POV.

Barry is standing near the harmonium, fiddling around. He
looks up, sees Elizabeth and Lena walking towards him and
tenses....they meet in the middle of the warehouse;

                    ELIZABETH
          Hey, what are you doing? Why are
          you wearing a suit again?

                    BARRY
          I don't know.

                       LENA
          Hi.

                       BARRY
          Hi.

                     LENA
          Do you remember me, I left my car,
          yesterday.

                       BARRY
          Yes I do.

                    ELIZABETH
          This is Lena, she's a good friend
          of mine from work. We were in the
          neighborhood and she had to pick up
          her car and we're getting breakfast
          before we go in, so did you want to
          go? We're gonna go and eat, let's
          go.

                    BARRY
          Yeah I can't.

                       ELIZABETH
          Why?

                                                       36.



                    BARRY
          I have work, I can't leave.

                    ELIZABETH
          Seriously, though: We're going to
          eat, I said.

                       BARRY
          I'm sorry.

                    LENA
          It's ok. That's alright.

                    ELIZABETH
          Are you learning how to play the
          piano? What is that?

                    BARRY
          It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE!
          MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN
          TOLEDO.

                       LANCE (OC)
          WHICH?

                    BARRY
          ...I'll tell you later.

                    ELIZABETH
          You don't wanna come to eat with
          us?

                    WORKER VOICE
          TELEPHONE BARRY ON LINE TWO!

                    ELIZABETH
          What's all this pudding?

                    BARRY
          I don't know. Can you hang on a
          second?

CAMERA follows Barry as he walks back to his little office,
picks up the phone;

                       BARRY (CONT'D)
          Hello?

                    SEXY VOICE
          We got disconnected before....

                                              37.



                  BARRY
        No. No. We got disconnect --
        why?.....you're calling me at
        work....how did you get this number
        -- ?

                  SEXY VOICE
        See the thing is I could make it
        really easy on you -- I already
        have your credit card number, your
        information, address and stuff.
        This is so awkward asking like
        this, I'm sorry --

                  BARRY
        This makes me very uncomfortable.

                  SEXY VOICE
        I need help.

BEAT.

                   SEXY VOICE
        Should I just ask your girlfriend?
            (beat)
        Maybe I should call back and talk
        to your girlfriend?

                  BARRY
        I don't have a girlfriend --

                  SEXY VOICE
        -- you said you did.

                  BARRY
        I know I did. But I don't.

                  SEXY VOICE
        You lied to me?

                  BARRY
        I didn't lie.

                  SEXY VOICE
        Why did you tell me you did, then?

                  BARRY
        This is....illegal....I'll call the
        police.

                  SEXY VOICE
        No you won't.

                                                       38.



ANGLE, ELIZABETH AND LENA

                    LENA
          I'll go pay for my car.

                    ELIZABETH
          Are you sure?

                    LENA
          Yeah.

                    ELIZABETH
          He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have
          no idea why he's being weird and
          dressed in a suit --

                    LENA
          It's not bad, it's ok.

                    ELIZABETH
          -- he's so strange I don't know if
          you really even would want to go
          out with him, someone like him, I
          said I'd try, but it's just --

                    LENA
          It's ok, it's alright. I'll come
          right back, I'll just go pay for my
          car.

                    ELIZABETH
          Sorry.

She leaves. Elizabeth heads for Barry's office; ANGLE, BARRY
on the phone

                    SEXY VOICE
          Come on, I thought we had fun, rich
          boy --

                    BARRY
          This is not cool.

                    SEXY VOICE
          It was cool last night.

                    BARRY
          I have to go.

                    SEXY VOICE
          Are you telling me no?

                                                       39.



                    BARRY
          No I'm sorry, now I have to get off
          the phone....

                    SEXY VOICE
          ....this is your mistake....

Elizabeth comes walking into his office, starts whispering to
him as he's on the phone;

                    ELIZABETH
          Hey, hey, you should ask her out --
          what do you think, she's cute,
          right?

                    BARRY
              (into phone)
          I'm gonna call you back.

He starts to hang up the phone, turns to Elizabeth as we
hear;

                    SEXY VOICE
              (trailing off)
          ...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....

                    BARRY
          She is. I think, why did you come
          here like this?

                    ELIZABETH
          It's not cool?

                    BARRY
          It's fine, but --

                    ELIZABETH
          -- do you think you'll ask her out?

                    BARRY
          I feel really on the spot now.

                    ELIZABETH
          Are you gonna do it?

                     BARRY
          I don't do that. I don't - things
          like that.

                    ELIZABETH
          You don't do anything, why are you
          being scared?

                                                       40.



                    BARRY
          I'm not being scared, you're just
          going to rag me if I do this --

                    ELIZABETH
          I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I
          do this just to rag you?

                    BARRY
          I don't know.

                    ELIZABETH
          I'll leave then, I'll go to get
          something from my car, go away so
          you don't feel pressure. Can I ask
          you a serious question:

                    BARRY
          What?

                     ELIZABETH
          Did you ask Walter to get you a
          shrink?
              (beat)
          Barry, did you ask Walter to get
          you a shrink? What's wrong with
          you? Are you ok?

                    BARRY
          I didn't ask him that. He's lying.

                    ELIZABETH
          You're being weird again, see. Come
          on. Please don't be weird.

ANGLE, BARRY AND ELIZABETH, MOMENTS LATER

They walk out and as they do, Lena comes back in with her
keys in her hand, Elizabeth keeps walking past;

                    ELIZABETH
          I gotta grab something from my
          car....

                    LENA
          We should be going --

                    ELIZABETH
              (over her shoulder)
          Yeah, no, I have to get something
          from my car, I said.

Barry and Lena about to be alone as Lance walks up;

                                                       41.



                    LANCE
          Which guy in Toledo are you talking
          about?

          I'll tell you...the
          guy...with...just talk to me later
          about it, ok?

                    LANCE
          You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?

                    BARRY
          I have to talk to you in a second
          about that, Lance, ok?

He walks away, Lena turns to him;

                    LENA
          I'm sorry I couldn't come to your
          sister's birthday party last night,
          Elizabeth had invited me and I
          couldn't make it --

                    BARRY
          It's fine. It was fun, though.

                    LENA
          It must be weird for you to have so
          many sisters?

                    BARRY
          No. Not at all. It's nice.

                    WORKER (OC)
          Telephone, Barry Line One!

Barry turns instantly and walks away....he turns back as he
walks....TWO SHOT - track left with him....

                    BARRY
              (turns back)
          One second, sorry.

IN THE OFFICE, THAT MOMENT

He picks up the phone.

                    BARRY
          Hello?

                                                       42.



                    SEXY VOICE
          Hang up again and see the trouble
          it's gonna make.

Barry instantly hangs up the phone, turns around and walks
back to Lena;

                    LENA
          Business is good, you're busy?

                    BARRY
          Yeah, not really.

                    LENA
          I saw a picture of you.

                    BARRY
          Yes.

                    LENA
          Elizabeth has a picture of you guys
          -- your sisters and you, it's a lot
          of family, it must be nice.

                    BARRY
          Do you have brothers or sisters?

                    LENA
          No. I'm the exact opposite --

                    BARRY
          That must be nice. That must be
          really, really, really great.

                    LENA
          It's terrible, no.

No response from Barry. (cut to reverse 2-shot as they look)

                    LENA (CONT'D)
          What do you do with all this
          pudding?

                    BARRY
          That's not mine it's one of the
          guys that works here. That
          pudding's not mine.

BEAT. In the b.g., two WORKERS are dealing with getting a
large crate on top of a large stack of crates, they're using
a fork lift....in an instant the large CRATE tumbles to the
ground and SMASHES....Barry attempts to not notice this;

                                                       43.



                       LENA
          Oh My God.

                    BARRY
          It's ok. That's ok. How long have
          you worked with Elizabeth?

The workers start calling out and apologizing for this to
Barry, who keeps looking straight ahead to Lena;

                    LENA
          Six months, maybe five, five or six
          months...do you wanna check that?

                    BARRY
              (to the guys)
          Are you guys hurt?

                    WORKERS/LANCE
          No, no, we're ok....Barry, sorry --

                    BARRY
              (back to Lena)
          So you do what she does, the same
          work, the same job?

                    LENA
          I do, but I do field consultations
          mainly too which is cool because I
          get to travel. I travel. A lot of
          the time. I'm going to Hawaii on
          Friday.

                    BARRY
          That's great -- Hawaii. I was
          thinking about going there.

                       LENA
          Really?

                    BARRY
          I was, yeah, I was thinking about
          going there for business --

                    LENA
          -- well, if you're gonna go --

                    BARRY
          -- I'm probably not gonna go
          though.

                                                       44.



                    LENA
          -- oh that's too bad, it's so great
          over there and if you were there we
          could say hello to each other or
          something --

                    BARRY
          -- yeah that would be great, if I
          was gonna go but I'm not exactly
          sure, I have so much goin on here --
          A lot depends on this thing I might
          do here and if that happens I can't
          go and if it doesn't happen then I
          probably will, but I doubt it.

There's another LOUD CRASH as they try to reposition the box
that's fallen, giving way to something else that FALLS. In
other words, to correct the mistake they've already made,
they have to sacrifice another CRATE that CRASHES. She looks,
Barry just flinches, tries to stay looking straight ahead;
CAMERA (HAND HELD) with Elizabeth, comes walking back
in.....says to Barry:

                    ELIZABETH
          I can't find that thing in my car,
          I can't find it so I'll just get it
          and give it to you later. So?

                     LENA
              (to Elizabeth)
          You ready?

                    ELIZABETH
          Are you coming to eat with us?

                    BARRY
          Yeah I can't.

                    ELIZABETH
              (at the crates)
          OH MY GOD. Look at that.

                    LENA
              (to Barry)
          It was great to meet you again. To
          see you again, thanks for helping
          me yesterday --

                    BARRY
          Ok.

                                                       45.



                    ELIZABETH
              (to Barry)
          What's all this pudding?

                    BARRY
          It's not mine.

                    ELIZABETH
          Why's it here?

                    BARRY
          I have no idea.

                    LENA
              (to Elizabeth)
          Are you ready?

                     ELIZABETH
              (to Barry)
          Will you call me later to talk
          about asking Walter for the shrink?
          And we can talk about - he said you
          have this crying problem or
          something?

                    LENA
          Bye, Barry.

                     BARRY
          Goodbye.

                    ELIZABETH
          Call me later.

Lena and Elizabeth leave. CAMERA leads them as they walk;
Sound starts to drop out, we see Barry and the boys cleaning
up the boxes in the back....move into a CU on Lena....Music
Cue. Score. treated piano, small rhythm/melodic(notes of
harmonium so far)/gentle.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?

                     LENA
          Ok.

Lena gets into her car. Elizabeth keeps walking. She waits
until Elizabeth is out of sight at the mouth of the driveway
and then she gets back out of her car and walks straight back
into the warehouse.

                                                  CUT TO:

                                                       46.



INT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

She comes walking in and over to Barry;

                    LENA
          I'm going to go and eat tomorrow
          night do you want to go with me?

                     BARRY
          Sure.

                    LENA
          Do you want to pick me up?

                     BARRY
          Sure.

                    LENA
          Can I write down my address and
          phone number for you?

                     BARRY
          Sure.

They do a small search for a piece of paper, get it all
written down and sorted out and then -- as they do this there
is even more CRASHING AND SMASHING in the b.g., by the boys --
Barry and Lena settle up and say so long.

                    BARRY (CONT'D)
          This is funny.

                     LENA
          Yeah.

                    BARRY
          I didn't ask anyone for a shrink,
          that was someone else. Also: This
          pudding is not mine. Also: I'm
          wearing a suit because I had a very
          important business meeting this
          morning and I don't have a crying
          problem.

                     LENA
          Ok.

                     BARRY
          Alright?

                    LENA
          ....Hi.....

                                                          47.



                     BARRY
           ....Hi.....

She walks off. CAMERA leads her out, holds a CU. as she
smiles to herself -- lead her a bit more until she's outside,
and she gets in her car -- CU. BARRY. He smiles, looks
around, holds back his emotion so it looks like he'll
explode....tenses, smiles, tears, looks around....HOLD. End
Music Que.

                     LANCE (OC)
           Barry, Line One, Telephone!

Barry walks in. HOLD. He picks up the phone.

                     BARRY
           Hello?

                     SEXY VOICE
           You've just made a war that you
           cannot afford.

She hangs up real quick. HOLD. Barry and his harmonium.

FADE IN:

INT. STEVENS BROTHERS HOUSE - DAY

CAMERA behind a BLONDE GIRLS HEAD (LATISHA). She speaks to
two blonde brothers, DAVID and JIM. In the b.g., walking
around holding a BABY is NATE. (Maybe a girlfriend or wife or
two).

                     DAVID
           I'll do it.

                     JIM
           I'll do it too.

                     DAVID
           But it's gotta wait until my knee
           is better. I can't risk it.

                     LATISHA
           You have to do it now.

                     JIM
           If we drive there it's a problem.

                                                       48.



                    LATISHA
          Dean will loan you one of his cars.

                       JIM
          Which one?

                    LATISHA
          You have to talk to him --

                    DAVID
          How do you know he's rich?

                    LATISHA
          Because I know, I just know. I
          mean, I talked to him, I know.

Nate emerges a bit from the b.g.

                    NATE
          Where are you guys going?

                    DAVID
          California. Los Angeles.

                    NATE
          When are you leaving?

                       DAVID
          Right now.

                    LATISHA
          Let's go talk to Dean.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. LOCAL BAR/PROVO - LATER

LATISHA, DAVID, JIM and NATE enter and meet DEAN TRUMBELL,
listening to AFTER EDEN play onstage, standing in the middle
of the room.

                       DEAN
          Hey guys.

                       DAVID/JIM/NATE
          Hey, Dean.

                    LATISHA
          So they'll go.

                    DEAN
          I'm only paying two of you guys.

                                                          49.



                    DAVID
          That's cool.

                    DEAN
          When can you leave?

                    DAVID
          As soon as you want.

                    DEAN
          I want you to go right away, I
          think that's best. I also need you
          to check out a car for me down
          there that this guy is selling.

They walk towards a back room, as they do they pass a REGULAR
JOE who bumps into Dean accidentally, Dean explodes;

                    DEAN (CONT'D)
          You wanna fuck around, asshole? You
          wanna get tough, wanna see me kick
          some motherfuck around here?

                    REGULAR JOE
          Take it easy, man, relax. Don't --

                    DEAN
          I'll relax your fucking head --
          this is my personal space, man,
          this is my personal fucking space,
          you don't violate that, you don't
          do that.

                    REGULAR JOE
          I've got a glass in my hand why
          don't you chill out?

                    DEAN
          You've got a glass?

Dean takes a BEER BOTTLE and SMASHES it in half on the bar,
holds it up to the guy --

                    DEAN (CONT'D)
          YEAH. YOU'VE GOT A GLASS, NOW I'VE
          GOT A GLASS. I'VE GOT A GLASS TOO
          MOTHERFUCK.

                                                JUMP CUT TO:

                                                       50.



INT. LOCAL BAR/PROVO - MOMENTS LATER

They're all walking towards a back room of the bar, they walk
past a COUPLE that is fighting. The WOMAN is screaming at the
top of her lungs at the MAN;

                    WOMAN
          I WILL CRUSH YOU. I WILL FUCKING
          CRUSH YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.

Dean gets in the middle of it;

                    DEAN
          Take it easy, take it easy you guys
          in here, I need to talk to you
          later, Tommy -- I wanna know if you
          wanna book the boys --

He motions over his shoulder to Ashes to Ashes.

                    MAN
          I'll talk to you later.

                    WOMAN
          YOU WON'T FUCKIN' TALK TO HIM
          LATER, I WILL CRUSH YOU. I WILL
          CRUSH YOU, ASSHOLE.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. DEAN'S OFFICE/UPSTAIRS/BACKROOM - MOMENTS LATER

They enter into an upstairs office area. It has a couple
desks and off to the side, in a small, partitioned off room
is The Phone Sex Area; a GIRL on the phone. (We hear bits of
her call, e.g. ""Me? I'm in Florida. Laying on my bed."")

There are posters for Ashes to Ashes, filing cabinets,
posters of CARS, lots of various small business items like
order forms and pamphlets, etc. Dean collects a piece of
paper and hands it to David/Nate/Jim;

                    DEAN
          Your expenses are your own.

                    DAVID
          I thought Latisha said you would --

                    DEAN
          -- she didn't know what she was
          talking about --

                                                        51.



                    DAVID
          It's....whatever....that's not
          cool.

                     DEAN
          David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It
          doesn't make sense if you think
          about it in a fair deal like sense.
          Ok? It's business. Seriously. One
          hundred dollars for two days work
          is a lot more than your family is
          making sitting around your house.
          I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now.
          Just stop.

He hands him a set of KEYS and goes through the info;

                    DEAN (CONT'D)
          ...keys for the track. You have to
          gas it up and save the receipts on
          that. His address. We have a
          business address too if you need
          that -- but hit him at his house
          first, see what this little bad boy
          is all about and shake him up --
          give him a little doe-see-doe --

                    LATISHA
          Uch. Shut up, Dean.

                    DEAN
          What's the problem?

                    LATISHA
          You don't need to talk all macho,
          ""shake him out, little bad boy.""
          Whatever -- you're not an action
          hero, tough guy, you're not a
          gangster --

He makes a very SUDDEN AND QUICK MOVE towards her and she
FLINCHES.

                    DEAN
          Flinchy. That's what I thought.
          Shut up.
              (to Greg)
          Call me when you see this guy --
          check him out see what's what. She
          asked him for seven fifty when she
          was on the phone with him, so --
          just call me when you get there.

                                                          52.



He hands him another piece of paper and a photo;

                    DEAN (CONT'D)
          This is this place called Ace
          Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't
          know exactly where this is and I
          don't understand these maps so just
          go there and check it out. It's a
          '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says
          is fine, but I need to figure out
          why he's only asking 23 for it. So
          take a look, the whole thing, call
          me about that, if it seems alright
          then I'll head down there and check
          it out.

                       DAVID
          Ok.

                       DEAN
          That's it.

                    DAVID
          Can we maybe ask for more money on
          this?

                       LATISHA
          Why?

                    DAVID
          ...because it's California? I mean
          it's like a nine or ten hour drive.
          It's not like going to Salt Lake
          and getting the Mormon's, it's
          different...

After a long, long staring contest with David, Dean SUDDENLY
AND VERY VIOLENTLY PUTS HIS FIST THROUGH THE WALL....then
turns to David......Latisha rolls her eyes. David, Nate and
Jim leave.

EXT/INT. LENA'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - EVENING

This is a SPLIT SCREEN SEQUENCE shot with TWO CAMERAS.

THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN holds Lena. She waits in her
small, nondescript apartment doing the things you do while
waiting for someone else. She sits, stands, sits, stands....

THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE THE SCREEN travels (STEADICAM) with
Barry as he walks into the RECEPTION AREA. There is a
SECURITY GUARD (black, female) who asks him his name, where
he's going and to sign in. The Security Guard calls up to
Lena's place....

....and we watch Lena answer the phone....

...The Security Guard gives Barry some very complicated
directions....we follow/lead Barry as he makes his way
through the maze/up elevators/down corridors looking for
Lena's apartment.....Finally, he arrives, knocks;

                       LENA
          Who is it?

                    BARRY
          It's Barry.

As she opens the door, THE SPLIT SCREEN SLIDES AWAY AND THE
IMAGES GIVE WAY TO THE ONE OF LENA standing;

                       LENA
          Hi.

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Lena and Barry at a table. They talk (see notes.)

                                                 54.



                     LENA
          So I want to tell you something, I
          gotta tell you: I saw a picture of
          you guys, your sisters and you and
          I saw your picture and I really
          wanted to meet you.
              (beat)
          I came to drop my car off there on
          purpose, to try and meet you.

Barry leans a little bit out of FRAME.

                    BARRY
          ...really? That's nice...are you
          lying?

                    LENA
          ...I thought I should tell you. I
          didn't want to get too far along on
          going out and be hiding something --

BEAT. He leans slightly back in FRAME.

                     BARRY
          That's very nice. Thank you. Thank
          you for saying that.
              (beat)
          You're friends with my sister?

                    LENA
          Yeah.

                    BARRY
          How long have you known her?

                    LENA
          About six months.

                    BARRY
          You like her?

                     LENA
          Yeah. Yeah we get along well.
              (beat)
          You didn't get along with her very
          well?

                    BARRY
          Did you really come to meet me on
          purpose or are you lying about
          that?

                                      55.



          LENA
No, no. I did.

           BARRY
That's nice. It's nice.
    (beat)
I've been looking around a lot
lately at promotional giveaways,
cross promotional work by some
companies. Do you remember all that
pudding?

          LENA
Yeah.

          BARRY
So that pudding was bought, I
bought that pudding because of a
pretty interesting promotion that's
sponsored by Healthy Choice and
American Airlines. It's designed to
encourage airline travel and
obviously designed to encourage
buying Healthy Choice products.
They make frozen meals, deli meats,
pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice
creams, this sort of thing.....

          LENA
Yeah?

          BARRY
....I'm sorry....I lost my
thoughts, what I was saying....

          LENA
You were talking about the
promotion --

          BARRY
-- the promotion says: buy any 10
Healthy Choice products and get 500
miles of airline travel or 1,000
for purchases made with a special
coupon.
          (MORE)

                                      56.
          BARRY (CONT'D)
So in the supermarket, you notice
their products, first you notice
they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner
at $1.79 - that's a pretty good
deal....but then I noticed they had
soup at 89 cents a can.....and you
start to do the math and you start
to notice that it's a really
amazing deal because I stumbled
across the pudding at 25 cents a
cup. Now the crucial thing is the
bar codes on the label. That's
those little bar codes, you know?
The universal product codes?

           LENA
Yeah.

          BARRY
That's what's used to redeem the
mileage, so in noticing the
pudding, each cup had an individual
bar code -- in other words: Two
dollars and fifty cents for ten
cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add
in the coupon: it's one thousand.
You see?

           LENA
Yeah.

           BARRY
You see?

          LENA
Yeah, no, I see --

          BARRY
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars
on pudding you could earn over one
million frequent flyer miles.

          LENA
That's insane. That is really,
really crazy. That's just crazy if
you spend three thousand dollars on
pudding.

          BARRY
....yeah....

          LENA
So that was your pudding?

                                                       57.



                       BARRY
          ....No....

                    LENA
          I'm sorry. I thought you said --

                    BARRY
          No I didn't say that.

                    LENA
          I thought you said you bought all
          that pudding --

                    BARRY
          My friend Carlos is doing it who
          works with me. It's his. It's his
          pudding, he's doing it. It's not
          mine. He's crazy. I told him not to
          do it. He's the one who's insane.
          He only spent about one hundred
          dollars so far though --

                    LENA
          Your sister was telling me a pretty
          funny story about you, when you
          guys were kids and you were
          building a ramp for your dog and
          you threw a hammer through a
          window? Is that right? You threw a
          hammer through a sliding glass
          door?

Barry starts to WELL WITH TEARS, which he hides very quickly,
holds a hand up to his face as if he's touching his nose, and
then he smiles;

                    BARRY
          I don't remember that, she might be
          lying. I have to go the bathroom.
          He gets up and goes.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Barry walks in and goes a little crazy. He's mad at himself
and he HITS a stall....it seems loose already and falls
straight to the floor.

This makes him go crazier and he continues to BEAT and KICK
the shit out of the bathroom/stall.

                                                       58.



HOLD. He collects himself and then he hesitates, looks
around, tries to collect the bathroom but it's in ruins, he
exits....

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. RESTARAUNT - MOMENTS LATER

Barry comes back and sits down, seems a little better. Tries
to be a little flirtatious for half a moment before: the
MANAGER comes over, leans in carefully;

                    MANAGER
          Hello.

                    LENA & BARRY
          Hi.

                    MANAGER
          Sir, can I talk to you?

                    BARRY
          Why?

                    MANAGER
          Just have you for one second,
          please.

He looks to Lena, excuses himself.


ANGLE, OFF TO THE SIDE.

The Manager and Barry step away, in a quiet section of the
restaraunt, 2-shot, profile, in sotto; SLOW ZOOM IN.

                    MANAGER (CONT'D)
          Sir, the bathroom was just torn
          apart.

                    BARRY
          Yeah.

                    MANAGER
          Did you do it?

                    BARRY
          No.

                    MANAGER
          You didn't just smash up the
          bathroom?

                                              59.



                  BARRY
        No.

                  MANAGER
        Well who did?

                  BARRY
        I don't know.

                  MANAGER
        You're hand is bleeding.

                  BARRY
        I cut myself.

                  MANAGER
        How?

                  BARRY
        On my knife.

                  MANAGER
        Sir, a young man saw you coming out
        of the bathroom.

                  BARRY
        I didn't do that.

BEAT.

                  BARRY
        Why? ...what?

                  MANAGER
        Your hand is bleeding.

                  BARRY
        I know.

                  MANAGER
        I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

                  BARRY
        Why?

                  MANAGER
        Sir, I have no way of proving that
        you demolished the bathroom --

                  BARRY
        I didn't do it.

                                                       60.



                    MANAGER
          Alright, well you're gonna have to
          leave. You're gonna have to go.

                    BARRY
          Yeah, but I didn't do anything.

                    MANAGER
          I'm gonna call the police then,
          sir.

                    BARRY
          Please don't do this to me.

                    MANAGER
          The police are on their way.

                    BARRY
          Sorry.

He starts to move back....

                    BARRY (CONT'D)
          Can I pay you here? Can I pay you
          for our drinks and salad?

                    MANAGER
          That's fine.

Barry takes out some money and hands it over.

                    BARRY
          Keep the change, please.

ANGLE, BACK AT THE TABLE.

They walk back to the table and Barry whispers down to her,
very close, STEADICAM (leads them out - continuous)

                    BARRY
          We should go I think, I don't like
          it here.

                    LENA
          Ok.

They head out of the restaraunt.

                    LENA (CONT'D)
          Is everything ok?

                    BARRY
          Yes.

                                                       61.



                    LENA
          What happened?

                       BARRY
          Nothing.

                    LENA
          What did he want?

                       BARRY
          Nothing.

They walk a bit.

                    BARRY (CONT'D)
          I have a better idea of where we
          can go.

                       LENA
          Ok.

They walk some more.

                    BARRY
          There's a better place for us to
          eat.

                    LENA
          Did something happen; are you
          alright?

                    BARRY
          Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok.
          It's fine. Everything is fine.

They walk some more and get in the car.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

                    LENA
          So....how is your harmonium doing?

Barry looks at her......

                    LENA (CONT'D)
          Your portable reed organ....the
          piano.

                                                62.



                    BARRY
          Well, it's fine. Thank you.

                    LENA
          Did you pick it up from the street?

                       BARRY
          What?

                    LENA
          Did you take it from the street in
          front of your work?

                    BARRY
          ...yes I did...?

                    LENA
          Are you learning how to play it?

                    BARRY
          Yes? I'm trying.

                    LENA
          Oh that's great.

BEAT.

                    LENA
          So you must travel a lot with all
          that pudding you bought?

                    BARRY
          Yes no not really.

INT. LENA'S APARTMENT - LATER

Lena and Barry finishing up the date;

                    BARRY
          Ok....well...I'm gonna go.

                       LENA
          ...yeah...

                    BARRY
          It was nice to see you again, to
          see your face again, to go out with
          you --

                    LENA
          I'll be around and back in town in
          a few days --

                                                          63.



                    BARRY
          Yeah.

                    LENA
          If you come to Hawaii --

                    BARRY
          Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about
          that.

                    LENA
          You don't think you'll go --

                    BARRY
          I don't know.

                    LENA
          Ok. Well call me when you get back,
          I mean, I'll call you when I get
          back. I'll be back for three weeks
          and then I go away for a month
          after that. So maybe in that
          time....

                    BARRY
          Ok. Have a good trip.

They do a shake hands/kiss on cheek goodbye.

INT. RECEPTION AREA/LENA'S BUILDING

Barry steps out of the elevator and walks to the exit,
passing a RECEPTION DESK WOMAN.....we hear the PHONE
RINGING......she calls out;

                    RECEPTION WOMAN
          Are you Barry?

                    BARRY
          Yes.

                    RECEPTION WOMAN
          It's for you.

          you're going or whatever you're
          doing right now I want you to know
          that I wanted to kiss you just
          then.

                    BARRY
          Really?

                    LENA

          So what do I do then?

INT. MAZE OF CORRIDORS - MOMENTS LATER

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

CAMERA pushes down towards him as he walks towards the door.
He knocks, she opens up, CAMERA SLIDES right in and lands as
they KISS and then the kiss turns into a small hug and then
they talk, real close. HOLD.

                    BARRY
          That was good.

                    LENA
          Yeah.

                    BARRY
          I'll see you later.

                    LENA
          Ok.

                    BARRY
          I don't freak out very often.

                                                       65.



                    LENA
          What do you mean?

                    BARRY
          I don't, no matter what my sisters
          say, ok?

                    LENA
          ...I don't know what you mean....

                    BARRY
          I don't freak out.

                       LENA

          Hi.

                    DAVID
          I need to talk to you for a second.

                    BARRY
          What?

                    DAVID
          You gotta give me some money.

Barry starts to walk away....David walks alongside him,
casually.....Barry looks over and sees the car has pulled
up....

                    DAVID (CONT'D)
          You made a phone call and you said
          you'd help a girl out and then you
          didn't....I'm here to get the
          money.

                    BARRY
          Wait a minute --

                    DAVID
          No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't
          make it a thing --

                    BARRY
          Please don't do this.

                    DAVID
          It's just you need to give me the
          money...do you have it right now?

MIKE D violently PUSHES BARRY STRAIGHT TO THE GROUND.

                     BARRY
          Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't
          please....

                    DAVID
          How much money do you have in your
          pockets?

                    BARRY
          Just take it, take the money in my
          pockets, take it, it's fine --

                                                       67.



They grab the money from his pockets as they hold him down on
the ground;

                    BARRY (CONT'D)
          It's three hundred and twenty
          dollars, just take it.

                    DAVID
          What do you have in the house?

                    BARRY
          Nothing....I mean, really...change,
          nothing....that's the cash I
          have....

                    DAVID
          You have an ATM?

                    BARRY
          Yes.

                    DAVID
          Is this where you live?

                    BARRY
          Yes.

                     DAVID
          You have another house somewhere or
          something?

                    BARRY
          No.

                    MIKE D
          This is three hundred and twenty.
          Let's just go to your ATM and
          that'll be it --

                    BARRY
          I didn't promise her money. She
          said that it was confidential, this
          isn't fair --

Mike D pushes Barry's face.

                    MIKE D
          Shut up, be quiet. Be quiet.

                    BARRY

                    DAVID
          HEY. You made a fucking sex call
          and now you're gonna pay. It's not
          a big thing -- just give us some
          money and then it's over -- we'll
          just walk down to the ATM and get
          your money out --

                    BARRY
          Alright, alright.

They pick him up and then;

                    BARRY (CONT'D)
          How do you want to do this?

                    MIKE D
          Let's just go to the corner, we saw
          a place on the corner, you'll just
          get your max out and that's it --
          you get out what you can and that's

          help someone out and you didn't so
          we're just getting some money for
          her and that's that.

                    BARRY
          You know, please, I just wanna say
          that I didn't say I would help her
          out; I was very clear about it....I
          don't think that this is
          fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch,

One of the WORKER'S pops his head in, says;

He picks up the phone;

          then to come across the

          What is this, man?

          You wouldn't want to go out with
          him anyway, honestly, he's such a
          freak sometimes.

                    LENA
          He did seem a little strange.

                    ELIZABETH (O.C.)
          Well...he's not that strange, don't
          say that.

          I'm sorry. You're right.

                    ELIZABETH (O.C.)

                       BARRY
          I'm sorry.

                    LENA
          You can't do that.

                                                         96.



                    BARRY
          Ok.

BEAT.

                    BARRY
          If you give me six to eight weeks I
          can redeem the mileage and then I
          can with you wherever you have to
          travel......

                    LENA
          So here we go.

CAMERA PUSHES IN AS MY KISS.

REVERSE, BARRY.

CAMERA slowly pushes in as he hugs Lena. LAND IN CU.

                                                FADE OUT...

Singles
By Cameron Crowe




    Page 1/39

I was living in this duplex.
For the first time, I was alone.
No dorm, no roommates, my own place.
I was so happy.
I had my own parking space.
Where I come from, they don't
keep them in cages.
They keep them in bins, you know,
so you can reach in and touch them.
- Hello.
- You need some help?
Yeah, thanks.
I'm from Spain.
Really? Which part?
Galicia.
I'm taking engineering at U of W.
- I like Seattle.
- U-Dub.
That's what people call it here.
Finally, a locaI tells me some secrets.
Listen, you really don't have to stay.
I think this will take some time.
Where else do I have to go?
In one week I have to go back to Spain.
My visa runs out.
U- Dub.
Let him know this is Linda Powell
from the Seattle EnvironmentaI CounciI.
Okay, great.
Thank you. Bye-bye.
Yes, that's right.
There's another spill in Bellingham.
Ruth, how long have I been
saying there are no guys?
Forever.
I met one.
I met one when I least expected it.
You held out on me.
He's an engineering student.
He's from Spain.
His visa runs out in 2 days.
He's like a comet.
What do I do?
I wish you could stay.


                                 Page 2/39

If I overstay my visa
I can't come back for 5 years.
Were you coming back?
Well, now I have a reason.
I want you to have this.
I wish I was better able to tell you
what I am thinking.
But this is a symboI of our future.
I want to return in...
...2 months and see you again.
I don't really have much
to give you...
...but it's important to me.
Use this when you get back.
You'll always have a parking space.
Don't wake up.
I'm about to get on the plane...
...and wanted to say goodbye.
I'll see you soon. Goodbye, Linda.
Goodbye, honey.
I miss you already.
Did you perform any other acts
with him before he left?
It's amazing.
We can't hide things in language.
We speak in basics.
Basics?
You know what else?
If I married him,
he could live in this country...
...and I'd always have a date.
You're talking about marrying him?
I'm tired of games.
If you were married,
would we still go out dancing?
We will always go out dancing.
What?
We will always go out dancing!
The Genie Classic!
You can't go wrong with this garage
door opener.
We have the Liftrex and Liftrex Super.
Might be more opener than you need.
And the Linear pocket-pager-


                                 Page 3/39

beeper-garage-door-opener...
...combo.
Just give me the best one you have.
I'll never lose it again.
I broke up with someone recently.
Jennifer, my last girlfriend.
I did it in a crowded restaurant.
She just stared at me with that look:
'How can you pass me up?'
I told her we weren't right and
all the stuff we both knew.
A week later I realized I was wrong,
tried to get her back.
She won't see me.
Now she's with Tony.
Tony knows Bailey, who's friends
with Tony's girI on the side...
...Rita, who I broke up with
to go out with Jennifer.
Do I tell Jennifer that I know
Tony's going out with Rita?
Or do I tell Rita that I know
about Tony and Jennifer?
Tony, who'll tell Jennifer I was still
with Rita when I went out with her.
How does stuff get so complicated?
I don't know.
Sometimes I wish it was as simple as
this postcard somebody sent me once.
Isn't that great?
I don't know.
Cliff!
I'm talking here, man.
I think back to the beginning.
My dad left home when I was 8.
You know what he said?
'Have fun.
Stay single. '
I was 8.
My mom's a teacher.
She took me to a doctor to learn
about sex. He was from Boston.
The father and the mother have
finally learned to come together.


                                 Page 4/39

The father inserts his penis in-
You do know what the penis is,
don't you, Steve?
The father inserts the penis...
...into the mother's vagina.
This is called intercourse.
And what comes out is called sperm.
Then the man keeps moving untiI
something squirts out of his penis.
What?
What comes out?
Spam.
Oh, man!
Maybe it was never simple.
I'll tell you this:
For the next 3 years,
I'm going to concentrate on work.
It's the only thing I have controI over.
Work.
I got to go.
I'm 23. Remember how old 23 seemed
when you were little?
I thought people would be
traveling in air locks...
...and I would have 5 kids.
Here I am.
I'm 23. Things are...
...basically the same.
I think time's running out
to do something bizarre.
Somewhere around 25,
bizarre becomes immature.
I get inspiration from my boyfriend.
He's a musician.
His band put out
an independent album last month.
He's a really good artist too.
He's like a Renaissance man.
I'm so glad he moved into my building.
What's the ordeaI?
Your machine wasn't on and
I was supposed to see you Saturday.
So I thought I'd come by and say hi.
How's this weekend?


                                 Page 5/39

We're busy.
We got that show, right?
Yeah, we got that show.
- We got guys coming from L.A.
- Great!
It'll be really rocking.
So come over after.
DeaI.
Look, you know I see
other people still, right?
You do know that, don't you?
You don't fooI me.
I could not be fooling you less.
Cliff, move your truck.
We made the connection.
It's like chemistry
takes care of itself.
It makes its own decisions.
You got to sit back and enjoy it.
You know when it's reaI,
and this is reaI.
We don't even have to discuss it.
Janet...
...you're spazzing off on me.
While we're young.
I'll see you Saturday, then and...
...I'll help you with your speakers.
What can I say?
She's crazy about me.
Check out my new Gortec watch.
I can store 20 numbers in this watch.
Tonight, I'll fill it.
All or nothing, no compromise.
Tonight I'll be the Super Me.
What if the Super You meets
the Super Her and she rejects you?
Then it's no problem.
- Why?
- Because it was never you.
It was just an act.
I live my life like a French movie.
Webster and 24th.
It should be here.
Let's ask this clown where the club is.


                                 Page 6/39

Hey, man!
Where's Desoto?
I get it, you're a mime.
Mime the address.
Give me a ride and I'll show you.
Where's Desoto?
Our car broke down.
I'll tell you about love.
Love disappears, baby.
Every time I've been broke...
...babe has been off like a prom dress.
Maybe it's the girls you choose.
Maybe I've been hurt!
Maybe I've been dogged!
Anybody know where this place is?
Am I a Thomas Bros. Guide?
You really shouldn't speak.
Yes!
Where do you guys work?
- I'm a maitre d'.
- Dept. of Transportation.
- He's working on gridlock.
- Thank God!
I build airplanes.
Hey!
Hello!
My friend and I have
this long-running argument.
He says when you come to
a place like this...
...you have to have an act.
So, anyway, I saw you standing there...

...so I thought:
I could just leave you alone...
I could come up with an act...

...or C:
I chose C.
What do you think?

I think that A:
You have an act.




                                  Page 7/39

And that B:
Not having an act is your act.
Thank you.
Talking with Cliff Poncier.
Any comments on the Seattle sound
and Citizen Dick's place in it?
I don't like to reduce us to being
part of the Seattle sound.
I like to think of us expanding more.
Like, we're huge in Europe right now.
We've got records...
A big record just broke in Belgium.
A song like 'Touch Me, I'm Dick'
is about what?
I think 'Touch Me, I'm Dick' in essence
speaks for itself, you know.
I think...
...that's basically what the song is...
...about, you know.
I think a lot of people might think it's
actually about, you know...
...my name is Dick and you can touch me
but I think...
...it can be seen either way.
Excuse me?
- Hello.
- Hi.
Want to meet up later?
Where?
- Anywhere you're going.
- Anywhere you're going.
We're going home.
- We're going home.
- See you!
Anywhere you're going.
Always get their numbers.
Tonight I got 20 numbers.
Twenty numbers.
You got numbers of 20 girls
you will never call, never date...
...never see in the daylight.
20 numbers that exist
only to make you feeI...
...like a guy who can get 20 numbers.


                                 Page 8/39

Watch the volume!
Sorry. Tinnitus.
Club disease.
You kids are all going to be deaf.
This is my night.
- What?
- Look.
Linda, don't look over.
I need another double latte,
no cream, skim milk, decaf.
I'm going to use that video date
you got me last Christmas.
It was a joke.
I know.
You think it's something
desperate people do.
You're wrong!
'Expect the Best' is the best
video dating in the country.
Debbie Hunt.
Call me before I go to Cabo.
- Your medication, Miss Hunt.
- Thank you.
You make the greatest coffee.
I can ask Steve.
I'll call you back.
The I-90 construction's
way behind schedule...
...and the Times wants to know why
there's gridlock on the I-5.
Tell them it's God's way of saying,
'Listen to the radio. '
Did you read my proposaI?
- What'd you think?
- I liked it.
You'll have to move it past Stu.
After lunch.
Okay. After lunch.
- Ted, what's up?
- Making music with my fingers.
And what a beautifuI sound it is.
Linda Powell, Steve Dunne.
Yeah, I met you 61 hours ago.
That was me.


                                 Page 9/39

Listen, want to get some dinner?
Busy.
How about some lunch?
Have a lunch. Coffee?
Water?
How about some water?
I'll meet you where you're having lunch
and we'll have some...
...water.
I think this whole decade
will have to be about cleaning up.
Our project spent last year
studying the Alaskan Exxon spill.
And now with...
...all the Exxon kickbacks and...
...things...
God, yes!
The worst!
I'm trying to put together
a group in June...
...to study the whole coast.
But I'm having a little trouble
getting a boat.
I think it will work out fine.
What?
There's just no privacy anymore.
I thought he was going to swallow her.
- Me too.
- My God!
Do you know what time it is?

-3:
- I'm so late!
- I'm glad your lunch date didn't show up.
- Me too.
- Did you really have a lunch date?
- No.
- So you want to-
- I'm getting over somebody.
- I really think it's a bad time.
- Maybe I'II- Okay.
Here's my car.
Let me give you a ride back to work.
Thanks.


                                 Page 10/39

Thanks.
I really like your take
on the supertrain.
It's ambitious.
If it were up to me...
She opened my car door button.
Unmistakable sign.
I like this girl.
Got to handle this one really well.
The thing I like best about you...
...is that you really listen to me.
You're a realist-slash-dreamer.
Thanks.
I get so pissed off
when I think about it.
That some jerk could
trash the Mona Lisa...
...or an ocean...
...or someone's life!
Who are your neighbors?
That's Bailey, right there.
He's a maitre d'.
He keeps us all in free meals.
On the corner there...
...that's Debbie Hunt.
She actually consumes men
instead of food.
And that is Cliff.
He delivers flowers, has four jobs...
...works in the coffee shop
around the corner.
Upstairs is Janet Livermore.
She works there too.
She's saving up for architecture schooI.
Cliff and Janet...
That's it.
You sound like me
talking about my family.
Want to go upstairs
while your stuff is drying?
That's a good picture of you.
Let me ask you a question.
Do you think about traffic, ever?
Because I do.


                                 Page 11/39

Constantly. Traffic is caused
by the single-car driver.
900,000 single people get
in their cars every morning...
...they drive to work and they wonder
why there's gridlock.
But if you had a train...
...a supertrain, you give the people
a reason to get out of their cars.
You give them great coffee,
great music...
...they will park and ride.
I know they will.
I still love my car, though.
The Sonics.
They got a good team this year.
Good thing they traded Xavier McDanieI.
What is he?
- A boxer or a basketball player?
- You dare to rip the X-man.
'IKiss at the HoteI De Ville. '
You have this too. I have this.
And albums.
I miss albums.
- I was a DJ in college.
- Really?
That's why I still have records.
Any boyfriends?
You don't want to know.
I've had bad luck.
But there was this one guy.
Rich.
All my girlfriends loved him.
All that stuff I told you about
the money I inherited?
I made that up.
Plus, I got back together
with Lynn last night...
...so you probably want
to go ahead and freak out.
It was like a professionaI hit.
I didn't want to get close
to anybody for a long time.
And then I-


                                 Page 12/39

- I'm talking too much.
- No, go ahead.
I thought for sure I'd
meet someone in college, you know?
A perfect combination of
MeI Gibson and Holden Caulfield.
And the SexuaI Revolution would
just sweep us both away.
I was a semester too late.
Condoms.
They're free!
It's okay to loathe these people.
Really?
There is so much life in you.
And so much...
...emotionaI larceny in these others.
I'm Andy.
I'm Linda.
'EmotionaI larceny'?
He said passion didn't matter
as much as comfort and stability.
- That's bullshit.
- No kidding!
Sorry.
It's cooI.
We lived together for 2 years.
We're still friends but-
I did the same thing.
It's like one day...
...one of you goes for groceries
and never comes back.
Everyone I know
wants everything to be easy.
I know.
Why'd I have to meet you in a club?
I don't know.
I love this song.
My clothes!
Is this you?
This gas-guzzling monster is you?
The environmentalist?
- I inherited it from my dad.
- I'm not sure how I feeI about that.
Let's maybe do something


                                 Page 13/39

this weekend or-
Okay.
- I'll call you.
- Don't forget.
I won't.
Good night.
Listen, next time, why don't you...
...park underground.
I should go.
I was just...
...nowhere near your neighborhood.
Burglar.
Burglar.
Neighbors!
It's Andy, calling to
make sure you're okay.
- She's okay.
- I thought about the talk we had.
I think you should trust him.
Although I think...
...he's putting on the moves.
I'm a guy.
I know these things.
I don't like that I know them
but I know them.
And I like that he's a Steve.
But be careful.
If he doesn't treat you right...
...I'll kick his ass.
Can you wait?
Just a little longer.
Whenever! Whenever!
You're amazing.
I feeI like I'm being pulled inside you.
Are we being too loud?
What are you thinking...
...right now?
I just go out and play good,
hard-nosed basketball.
Things happen throughout the game.
It's nothing you can do.
I don't go out and say I'll
to beat this or that guy up.
Anything else, X?


                                 Page 14/39

Steve, don't come yet.
God!
I'm in love with my neighbor.
Why don't you call me, Cliff?
What can I eat?
I'm tired of starving myself
for this guy.
Salad!
I'll have a salad.
If I call him that's being desperate.
He's late or he forgot.
I refuse to remind him he forgot.
If he shows up, I'll listen.
But no way do I call him.
Of course, men do like to be called.
I'll call him in 10 minutes.
That will be one hour and
that is officially very late.
He is officially very late.
If I make this basket,
that's fate telling me to call him.
Two out of three.
Wait!
Did no basket mean call him or don't
call him?
Busy. That's a sign.
Fate says don't call.
Forget it.
I'm not desperate.
I have many, many people
to spend a Saturday with.
Stop getting involved with your neighbors.
- Is that what broke us up?
- We're better as friends.
The thing about Cliff is...
...he has all this fierce integrity.
Except when it comes to women.
He likes...
...these club-type women.
These huge, hourglass Amazon women.
I think it's great you're together
but protect yourself.
So I'm not an Amazon woman?
You're from the high plains.


                                 Page 15/39

I'm so glad I live here.
Are my breasts too small?
God!
Because, I mean...
...I look around
and all I see are these...
...posters and billboards
and magazines...
...and TV shows all with
these women with huge breasts.
And I guess...
...I just wanted to ask,
is that what men really want?
I mean, is that what you want?
You know?
Don't lie, because your eye twitches
and I'll know.
Ask me.
Are my breasts too small?
Sometimes.
Have you had implants before?
What do you think?
No.
You take a couple of days
and make up your mind.
We skew the size specifically
to what you want...
...by graph, right.
Well, what's painfuI?
It can be mildIy painfuI and certainly
safety is on everybody's mind...
...mine in particular.
Right.
Take a couple of days and
think about it. All right.
Heard you on the phone. I'm in.
I don't need a couple of days.
How about...
...that?
Maybe for your frame,
something a little less...
...hourglass.
I think if you're going to
have the operation...


                                 Page 16/39

...have the operation.
Do you jog?
A little.
Maybe...
Split the difference?
Split the difference.
Hi, it's me.
I'm tired of doing the right thing...
...waiting for you to call me.
I'm on the bed right now...
...wearing something really outrageous.
I've got no underwear on.
I need to be touched.
I'm burning for you, Cliff.
I think you got the wrong number,
but I'll be right over.
This guy plays no games.
That's great!
I've got to play this one perfectly.
Go with it.
What do your instincts tell you?
Not to listen to you guys.
She doesn't want you
tugging at her bra strap.
She wants mystery.
She wants drama.
She wants excitement.
I know women.
I don't want drama.
I don't want excitement.
I want to trust him.
Should I trust him?
Not all guys are like Luiz.
You're right.
You're right.
Steve is different.
Will you just follow your instincts?
Don't treat this like casuaI sex.
CasuaI sex doesn't even exist anymore.
It's lethaI. It's over.
What are you thinking?
If I had a conversation with God,
I'd ask him to create this girI.
My chest hurts.


                                 Page 17/39

You didn't leave a note, did you?
I left my blue T-shirt by mistake.
There are no mistakes!
What's that mean?
Give me the phone.
I'm going to call my new...
...semi-girlfriend.
You don't realize.
You'll scare her off.
She's beautifuI.
Anyone would call her.
You distinguish yourself
by not calling her.
P.S. That's how you get her.
Bailey, you don't understand.
Remember your last 3 girlfriends?
You're right.
I got to let this one breathe.
You're concerned about dioxins.
I'll give you Greenpeace's number.
How'd it go?
I got the boat.
Trip to Alaska's set.
Great, Linda! That's great!
Steve on 2.
Four days he waits to call me.
What do I tell him?
I went for groceries.
She went for groceries.
He's coming over.
'Nothing'?
Nothing is wrong.
Really.
- I thought we connected.
- This is a really small office.
- Is this because I didn't call?
- I don't remember. Did you call?
Why are you being like this?
I like you. It was cooI meeting you.
I'll call you or you call me.
Look, I'm sorry if I blew it
by not calling you.
You don't owe me.
You don't have to call me.


                                 Page 18/39

Is it that old boyfriend
who always calls?
He doesn't always call.
- He probably has a ponytaiI.
- No.
He's Mr. Sensitive PonytaiI Man.
He's not Mr. Sensitive PonytaiI Man.
You're scared to get close to me.
You don't know me enough to say that.
- I think I do.
- No, you don't.
Let's not play games.
If I was playing games I'd have
waited a week to call.
What I mean is-
I got to work, Steve.
- Bye, Steve.
- I left my T-shirt at your-
Why?
Why do you talk such a good game?
You talk about things that matter...
...that get me excited, that get me hot.
Then it's like...
...you're lobotomized.
Why can't I just protect myself?
Why can't I just...
...be a buddy?
Glad I caught this one in time.
Can't leave myself open.
Better to be the dumper
than the dumpee.
Listen, Mom, if he
invited you to Hawaii, yes...
...he probably wants something.
And who cares?
Dad's been gone for 2 years.
Listen. Listen, Mom!
Look, Debbie.
I'm having a bad sugar crash.
Could you just hold it down?
Wait a second.
Rinse off your dishes
before you put them in the dishwasher.
I rinsed them.


                                 Page 19/39

No, you have to rinse off all the food
or it gets over everything.
I found this big little
chunky thing on my glass.
No biggie.
Wish me luck on my video
for Expect the Best.
This is for Expect the Best?
I brought some clippings,
some possible looks for my video.
Here we have the Edie Sedgwick.
You know?
Pseudo-Brigitte Bardot.
Or we jet on over to Spain
for the depressed millionairess.
And...
...I love these earrings
that nobody loves but me.
Truth?
Truth.
I will create your new look.
I will have men dying at your feet.
$ 10 extra...
...and Brian will shoot your video.
He doesn't even know me.
Debbie...
...he is only, like,
the next Martin Scorcese.
I'm in your hands.
I am Debbie Hunt.
If you want to see how I look
rewind and freeze frame.
But I am not about...
...looks.
I crave responsibility,
respectability and love.
My goals are serenity and knowledge...
...and men who can understand me.
No druggies, please.
I'm fairly intense.
And I'm an advertising exec...
...at KRWE-TV.
That's me!
Come to where the flavor is.


                                 Page 20/39

Come to Debbie Country.
'Debbie Country. '
It's funny.
'Doghouse. '
It should be 6 or 7 songs.
- They want me to come out.
- Stone's right. They're friends.
'Doghouse' as an encore, man.
You can't start off with that.
Why make those people clap,
so we come out again?
You don't get it, do you, man?
Check out this review of our record.
Read it out loud.
'Once again, when Cliff Poncier sings-'
Wait a minute. I don't want
to hear anything negative.
Go on.
'He was ably backed by Stone,
Jeff and drummer Eddie Vedder. '
That's a good review.
A compliment for us
is a compliment for you.
No, man.
This negative energy
just makes me stronger.
We will not retreat.
This band is unstoppable!
This weekend, we rock Portland.
I know you're in love,
but are you sure you want to do this?
My mind is made up.
Want to read a magazine?
Thanks for doing this with me.
Didn't want you to go alone.
Tell me, what do you
really want from a guy?
When I first moved here from Tucson...
...I wanted a guy with...
...looks...
...security...
...caring...
...someone with their own place.
Someone who said 'bless you'


                                 Page 21/39

or ' gesundheit ' when I sneezed.
And someone who liked
the same things as me, but not exactly.
Someone who loves me.
Tall order.
I scaled it down a little.
What is it now?
Someone who says
' gesundheit ' when I sneeze.
Though I prefer 'bless you. '
It's nicer.
Sorry you had to wait.
This is my friend Steve.
Dr. Jamison.
Come on in.
Last chance.
Here we go.
I'm going to say something that
I haven't said to any patients...
...in 3 years of being at HMO.
I will perform the operation
but I don't think you need it.
I think you're perfect.
I think if your boyfriend doesn't
appreciate you the way you are...
...then you have to ask,
are you his Miss Right...
...or are you his Miss Maybe?
What's that mean?
Did my check bounce?
I really have a feeling about you.
Thanks but...
...I love my boyfriend.
I still feeI good about
saying what I said.
You should. It's good!
Can I say something to you?
Sure.
Your face wants a different part.
- You know, your hair.
- My hair?
There you go!
Now you look vaguely rocking.
I mean, come on.


                                 Page 22/39

You're a happening guy, you know?
You're Dr. Jamison.
You've got...
...nice eyes. And you've got those
great, trustworthy eyebrows.
And you're a surgeon, man!
Many, many babes are into that.
No, really!
Listen, I have friends
who would love you.
I don't know how to have fun, right?
I'm 33 years old and
I don't know how to have fun.
There.
Now was that fun or what?
Yeah. That was fun.
Doc?
And now with the operation.
I want Cliff to like me the way I am.
Thanks.
A few days later, she leaves the hive.
Now she's ready to mate.
So Portland, maybe it wasn't our city.
Where are the anthems of our youth?
What happened to music
that meant something?
The Who at the IKingdome
or IKiss at the Coliseum?
Where is the 'Misty Mountain Hop'?
Where is the 'Smoke on the Water'
or the 'Ironman' of today?
We're not going out tonight,
are we, honey?
Look at this. These bands are like
well-designed bottles of bleach.
It's beer-and-lifestyle music.
I mean, it's like the next world war
is going to be sponsored by...
I don't know. What?
We could just take a bath.
Just remember one thing.
We are loved in Belgium and in Italy.
The yellow jacket wasp
has come looking for food.


                                 Page 23/39

The alarm has sounded.
They pour into the European hive.
Hey, babe, don't get me sick.
I'm playing this weekend.
Wait a minute.
What am I doing?
I don't have to be here.
I could just break up with him.
I have always been able to do this.
Break up with someone
and never look back.
Being alone.
There's a certain dignity to it.
Did I overreact?
You know who this is?
We spent a couple
of great weeks together.
But my mind works in strange ways.
When things are at their best,
I wait for them to fall apart.
I can't figure out
if I do it to myself...
...or if life does it for me.
I'm a little late this month,
that's all I'm saying.
How late?
Late.
Steve Dunne.
Doug Hughley.
Mr. Deegan's class.
What is up, you old goat?!
- How you doing?
- Okay, man.
You know how much homework
I missed because of you?
I loved your radio show.
That was the best.
Thanks, man.
We're throwing down tonight
over on Aloha Street.
We got 2 bands.
It'll be insane!
Would you get up and do a little
'Wheels of SteeI'?


                                 Page 24/39

Are you sure?
You're the only one who can mix up
Elvis Costello and Public Enemy.
What's so funny about
Peace peace peace?
Love and under-
Death Row
What does a brother understand?
You're the best.
You are the king.
You are the king!
You've got to be there, man.
You must be there!
Of course, you may be busy.
Ten more minutes and we pour X into B
and if it's blue-
Then we have a big talk.
- I have some time right now.
- Then let's talk right now.
- My body knows it'll be blue.
- It won't be blue.
I've never gotten anybody pregnant.
It won't be blue.
I'm probably sterile.
A family trait.
Really?
Do you know where my other shoes are?
Maybe they're by the door.
That'd be wild.
- What?
- Having a kid.
- If you were pregnant.
- If I were.
Which I'm not.
And I wouldn't expect you
to deaI with it anyway.
I'd be with you.
We'd deaI with it.
To friendship.
That's bluish, right?
It's fairly blue.
Oh, well.
Wait. Put it against
something blue, though.


                                 Page 25/39

Wait. Let's try and put it
against something white.
- So what are you doing today?
- Not much.
I got to meet the deputy mayor
to see the mayor.
- Good. I have stuff to do too.
- So you can call me.
Call you or...
- And finally...
- Interesting!
...if we can get the single-car driver
onto the supertrain...
...we can change the city.
It's all in the proposaI.
Flirts with brilliance.
Wish it were up to me.
Let me get you 15 minutes
with the mayor.
Thank you.
So basically, that's kind of
what we're all about...
...give or take a little.
I'd like to just kind of
leave it up to you at this point.
I think that will be great.
I think you've explained it really well.
These are the men who want me.
But I'm more than just a good body.
Feelings, man!
I have a lot of
tender feelings which are...
...just waiting for the right woman.
It's hard to get it across
when you look like this, obviously.
My name is Spiro. I'm an artist.
As you can see, my painting
is displayed behind me.
I'm the kind of person that's really...
...meticulous in appearance,
and also very precise.
In fact, if two people
really believe in each other...
...that love can go around the world


                                 Page 26/39

and through each other's soul.
But love is a very delicate thing.
In fact, if you're both not careful
and nurturing, that love can...
I'm looking for a woman
who is unpredictable.
Someone who is complex.
Someone who is willing to experiment.
I like the way the world
looks from a bicycle.
I guess I'm just looking for someone
who feels the same way I do.
About a bicycle.
Am I coming off as too intense?
I can be intensely laid back too.
I am very...
...very...
...very lonely.
Who?
Definitely the bicycle guy.
The bicycle guy.
He's, like, your souI mate.
Guy with the bicycle.
Nice outfit.
Is he late?
Yeah, but...
...I expect the best.
So why did you pick this Sea Merchant?
The First Avenue one is way happening.
You mean there's another Sea Merchant?
The new one.
On your right!
Excuse me.
Was a Jamie here looking
for a Debbie Hunt?
Yes, and he left you a message:
I got your address from Expect the Best.
Meet you at your house.
Great!
He was hot!
Desperation.
It's the world's worst cologne.
- You're good at that.
- It's the key to popcorn.


                                 Page 27/39

SwirI with the bowI.
Let's put the bowI down.
Let's make some more.
All right.
Are you okay? I'm sorry.
More popcorn!
Want more popcorn!
Stop, stop, stop.
- You want more?
- How does it work?
- Do you want butter?
- Do I want butter?
Yeah. You represent well
in reaI life.
Thanks a lot. So do you.
Thank you.
When I missed you at Sea Merchant...
...I buzzed over on my Elite
and I ran into Pammy!
- Pammy from U-Dub.
- Pamela. I'm Pamela now.
Oh, you're Pamela.
Did you see that package
out on the porch for you?
No. Jamie and I made popcorn.
We're making popcorn here with IKermit.
I'd love to show you
this package on the porch.
Just one second.
Sure.
First off, we always said
separate lives.
- It's no biggie.
- It's a major biggie!
I knew him first!
So that gives you the right
to just bone him in my kitchen!
If I wanted that guy,
I wouldn't need a video date to get him.
No, you'd just wait for me to meet him
and then make popcorn!
I will make popcorn
with whomever I want to.
You've made popcorn


                                 Page 28/39

with half of the city!
At least I don't have to
chase the popcorn.
I don't think we should take
this vacation together.
You told me to tell you
when you're being plastic.
You're being plastic.
This is so unfair.
How much do you want for him?
$ 200.
- Outrageous!
- That's what I paid.
- $ 75.
- $ 150.
$80 and I'll do dishes all month.
DeaI!
Fine!
- We need to talk.
- I think we do.
There's something I need to say.
- You want out.
- Let's get married.
Everyone around us is together
for the wrong reasons.
Or they baiI out.
This is life telling us something.
- Oh, God!
- What?
Don't make me remember
this chili dog forever.
Remember it.
Make that a historic chili dog.
Take your time.
Think about it.
You don't even have to use words.
Just take a bite if the answer is yes.
I want to be logicaI about this.
Say we're married, we have the kid.
Will we be anything like we are now?
It's really the great unknown.
Plus I've got work.
I've got that Alaska trip,
you've got your thing.


                                 Page 29/39

I want to be logicaI.
I think I can love you
and still be logicaI.
What?
What is that look?
Someone who really cares about you.
It must scare you to death.
Forget logic.
What's in your heart?
I want to do it.
I think this is life
telling us something.
So that's a yes?
You're going to feeI good about this.
Really?
Mom, I want to get out!
Why can't we get out?
Did we make the right decision?
I don't know.
Xavier almost made the AII-Star team.
He fights players
who are better than him.
- Like?
- Like Charles Barkley.
That is a Bobby Van.
Who?
The host of Make Me Laugh.
I never got to finish that chili dog.
That light's on yellow way too long.
You okay?
You all right?
I'm fine.
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Let's get out.
Come on, let's get out.
James.
James.
Who's James?
I don't know.
Honey.
James Worthy is a star.
X is just a player.
Is this from an earlier conversation?


                                 Page 30/39

Good sign.
We had an accident, baby.
You're in the hospitaI.
I lost it, right?
It's all over.
If we can't make it through this...
...if you don't know
you're not alone...
I lost the baby.
Will you look at me?
I was flunking out of high school.
I was 45 pounds overweight,
had a dead-end job, a beat-up car.
I didn't feel good about myself.
My future did not look very bright.
How are you doing today?
I'm better.
I think I've read every single
magazine in the world.
- Did you go to work today?
- No, I didn't.
It's been 2 weeks.
I think they're going to fire me.
I need some time alone.
Alone?
I have a new emotion every five seconds.
I think I should go ahead
and take that research trip.
I should just be out somewhere
in the middle of the ocean.
Alone.
I know I'm right about this.
It's just a month.
It's just work.
See you in a month!
I'll miss you!
Janet!
I got a present for you.
Give me another chance.
One, two minutes.
Come on.
This'll be great.
You're going to love me for this.
I installed your new stereo.


                                 Page 31/39

Great!
I'll replace the windows.
Thanks.
Work.
Work has never been better.
I miss her.
What will we say to each other
when she gets back?
- Welcome back.
- You look great.
You too.
How are you?
How was it?
It was really good.
Really good.
You want to go home
or out someplace?
I could do either.
Can you think of a place?
There's Costa's, I guess.
Or whatever.
The 3-2-1?
- No, Costa's all right.
- I don't really care.
Jesus!
The pressure in the air could sink us.
I know.
I really got into my job again.
I did too.
I've been working my ass off.
I had the Coast Guard working for us.
It was reaI exciting.
That's great.
We don't have to try
and be what we were.
Thanks.
I've been thinking the same thing.
Great.
Friends.
Let's be the first people in history
to say it and mean it.
You always say the perfect thing.
That obnoxious mime...
...was right.


                                 Page 32/39

Love disappears.
Let's go, man!
Let's go!
We got people out here!
I got to go piss, man!
Let's go!
Linda.
It's me.
I had to call you.
It's about midnight.
I was having many beers...
...and I wanted to say...
...what I should have said at the dock.
I fucking chickened out.
I lied when I acted casuaI,
like Mr. CasuaI...
...and I should have said it!
You belong...
...with...
...me!
We belong together.
It pissed me off that, now that
we're talking, you thought...
...I proposed to you only because
you were pregnant!
I've got to go piss!
This is not the bathroom!
Maybe if I'd said some of
these things at the dock...
...it would've made a difference.
I think we made a big mistake.
We had good times and bad times...
...but we had times.
And I would like to start over.
I would like to be new to you.
I want to be new to you.
I want to be Mr. New.
Call me back if you want.
This is the last time I'll call.
If you really needed to know
how I really feeI...
...that's how I feeI. I love you.
That's something you should know.
I won't bother you again.


                                 Page 33/39

Good night and goodbye.
I love you. Call me back.
Goodbye.
This thing just eats tapes.
So ultimately we're talking about...
...900,000 to a million people
by the time it's done...
...most of them single-car drivers.
We provide a better and safer
environment than their cars.
Why can't it work, Mr. Mayor?
So it's a train.
A supertrain.
I've been burned by this
train business before.
You people all seem to forget.
We can change this city.
People love their cars.
But if you give them great coffee...
...and great music. If you-
I'll put it to you like this...
...then I'll thank you
for your time.
My answer is...
...no.
Hi, may I help you?
One ticket to Cabo San Lucas...
...through Los Angeles,
first class, please.
Could you seat me next to a single guy?
I think I'll put you in seat 3-C.
Thank you.
Tell me everything there is
to know about you.
I've got a speciaI feeling about you.
Don't feeI too bad about her.
I'll tell you what happened.
The kid talks her ear off
the whole flight.
His dad picks him up at the airport.
He's divorced. He meets Debbie.
His first words are...
Look at those fantastic earrings.
And that's all it took.


                                 Page 34/39

Debbie was in love.
She got back 2 weeks ago. He sends
her the big basket every day.
Every third one she sends back
just to be mysterious.
I don't know. Games.
He wants her to move to Mexico.
And if she gets a job at the
TV station there, she's going.
Thanks.
Tomorrow I sneak in and spell
her name in rose petals.
Do you believe this job?
It's so easy to fall back
into old patterns.
Back with Andy.
One week and we're already
like one of those...
...old couples who sit around in
Denny's and don't speak.
What am I doing?
Why did I chicken out?
You have the...
No.
This is good.
Being with Andy is like being alone.
Together.
At least I'm not out there dating.
Love you.
Love you too.
What?
I was worried about you.
I'm fine.
I am great!
Been working.
I read half of Exodus.
I think you're going through
a phase of some kind.
Do you realize that
in modern-day society...
...there is almost no need
to leave the house?
At all.
You're wigging.


                                 Page 35/39

I'm not wigging.
What? You think I'm wigging?
This is hang time.
I'm just...
I'm just regrouping.
I'm spending some time with myself.
Getting stronger. Regrouping.
Thinking about regrouping.
I'm thinking about how I listened
to my instincts and they were wrong.
Wrong. The opposite of right.
I just wanted to bring you your maiI.
You know...
...and maybe this isn't the
right time to say this...
...but things do turn around.
I mean, I don't even think
about Cliff anymore.
I'm having the best time ever.
On my terms.
And you know what else?
I'm going back to schooI.
Really?
Paid off my loan.
Got all my classes.
My first project is
to redesign the fountain...
...so we can sit in it.
That's good news.
It is.
People need people.
It has nothing to do with sex.
Maybe 40 percent.
60 percent.
Forget it. Forget it.

Tell you what:
If I have any kind of news
of any kind...
...something good...
...something nice...
...that I want to share with you
or something...
...I will knock four times, okay?


                                    Page 36/39

It's going to be...
...our secret code.
How?
- What?
- How?
- How what?
- How will you knock?
Like that.
Take care of yourself.
Please.
In a paralleI universe,
we're probably a scorching couple.
But in this one...
...neighbors.
Did you get my message last night?
Because I called.
I know.
I thought I appreciated you
but I didn't.
I used to...
...live out by the airport
underneath the flight patterns.
It was noisy with the planes
going by all day.
I used to have cookouts
and no one would come...
...because of the noise.
I got used to it.
And then, when I moved,
I missed the noise.
I missed the planes.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
I miss you.
The way you used to look at me.
Don't.
I'm finally over you.
Really?
I mean, you know,
I still really do like you.
You know?
I think you're very...
What?
Entertaining.


                                 Page 37/39

That's me. I got to go.
My break's over.
Janet, you rock my world.
I'm walking down the avenue
And I'm looking at the garbage cans
I'm laughing at the people I see
Something like that.
I'm just playing with the lyrics.
None of that stuff is set in stone.
Anyway, I'm working on it.
Call me when you get in.
I don't know
what you're doing tonight.
But give me a call.
Talk to me, talk to me.
40 rsums, bring me back something.
Here we go!
I was just nowhere near
your neighborhood.
I don't need to be your girlfriend.
I just want to know you again.
What took you so long?
I was stuck in traffic.
That's the way it happens around here.
Steve's moving out,
they're finding their own place.
- I'm happy for them.
- Look out!
No problem.
I may live here forever and that's fine.
Not everybody needs to be with someone.
I don't know, for a lot of people,
living alone is a nasty hang.
Not for me.
My music is all the juice I'll need.
I'm a self-contained unit.
I'm a solo artist.
I better get going.
I'm going out tonight.
Going out?
You?
That's a nice hat you're wearing.
And I don't mean that
in an Eddie Haskell kind of way.


                                 Page 38/39

Thanks.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
Does everyone go through this?
No, I think just us.
I'll be celibate forever.
I could spend the rest of my life
with that girl.
She's in a car.
All you see is her head.
- I know my type.
- I met someone new.
- She's more my type than yours.
- She is not.
- She is.
- You always say they're your type.

Augie, pick up line four, please.

- Mr. McCulloch,
they came in, but there was a fog--
If I don't get my cherries in 5 minutes,
you don't get your money
and you starve and you die.
Jerry?
- Where are McCulloch's cherries?
- They're here,
but you gotta take a look.
Ah, Mr. McCulloch, be right back.
Where are my cherries?
Augie, did you grow these under your arms?
Jesus, snails with stems.

- george, get them out of here.
- You got it.
Bauer. Thank you. Honey, what's up?
We get a lot of rain and cherries get slime.
-I can't hear ya.
-You agreed to take these off our hands.
- When the hell did I agree to that?
- Not you, your brother.
Ah, all right.
Victoria, I can't hear you.
What I'm doing is important too.
My brother bought your slimy cherries?
Yeah. We were playing poker.


                                 Page 3/42

He had two pair. I had a flush.
He had no cash, so we worked this out.

dd [ Car Radio ]
Who put this goddamn fruit here?
I'm all right, if anyone's concerned.
good morning, Freddie.
Allen! Allen!
A simple ''yes'' or ''no.''
I made it. I'm in Penthouse magazine.
They printed my letter!
Listen, I'm very happy.
I'm in the Forum section.
The story's entitled, ''A Lesbian No More.''
They printed every word.
It's a beautiful story.
I want copies for everybody.
Augie, good to see you!
great game. We gotta do that more.
- Can we talk?
- great poker player.
- Cheats like a son of a bitch!
- We have to talk.
- Missing petty cash?
It was the cleaning girl.
- I don't care.
You don't? I admit the whole thing.
I still don't care about it.
I love this guy! Do you hear me?
- gimme a kiss.
- Oh, Freddie.
Too big to kiss your older brother?
I love this guy's head.
Here's a buck. Wash my car.
Bauer! Where are my--
Your cherries, yes.
Believe me, you won't be
satisfed with what we have.
You're ruined! Everyone's gonna know
you left me dry.
You're fnished, a ghost.
- How'd you like bananas at cost?
- Deal!
Set up our friend with bananas at cost.


                                 Page 4/42

Allen, wait. I've got to get out early.
gee, right. Today's the big day.
Ushers have to be early too.
- I'll be there.
- Okay.
[ Woman On P.A.] Will someone
get thoseJonathans off the truck?
Any messages, Mrs. Stimler?
Yes.
What are they?
Huh? Oh,
your father wants you to call him back.
Mrs. Stimler, our father
passed away fve years ago.
- Remember?
- Right.
Should I get him for you?
No, no. We'll-- I'll take care of it.
You just get back to work.
- What's with her?
- A little accident over the weekend.
got hit in the head by some lightning.
It's not funny, Freddie!
I'm sorry. That's not funny.
Besides, she can still do certain things.
Like jump-start a car?
[ Laughing ]
Jump-start a car.!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-What the hell are you doing down here?
-Maybe I went...
- to the ''Club A'' last night.
-Something new for you.
Maybe I met Mr. Buyrite,
owner of Buyrite Markets.
Maybe we had a few drinks.
And maybe,just maybe...
we're his new produce suppliers.
I'm proud of you.
That's great.! Which store?
Not which store, the whole chain.
I hope you are joking with me.
Think big, be big.
He was a colonel. I made up a story...


                                 Page 5/42

about you being wounded in Nam
and he wants to do business.
He's coming this morning.
great, Freddie. It's only chaos down here.
- Augie brings me slimy cherries.
-So what?
-Jerry's getting married tomorrow.
- So what?
I was drinking with this bum all night.
- I'm busting my buns.
- East 77 th Street.
- Come on, you can handle this deal.
- Yeah, I'll handle it.
- Your desk looks like a pigsty.
- I have a system.
-[ Buzzer ]
- Phone for you.
Yes? All right. Thank you.
Hi, Victoria. I'm sorry.
I forgot to call you back.
What's the matter?
Your voice sounds funny.
What? Now?
You're moving out of the apartment now?
While we're talking?
Yeah, I know we were going to talk about it.
Victoria, this is a little impulsive.
If we were married you
wouldn't move out like this.
- She might. Sure.
- get off.
- Was that you?
- get off the phone!
- I'm so sorry!
- Not you.
Why not tell a guy you're on the phone?
[ Door Closes ]
What do you mean, ''Do I love you?''
Well, I--
Well, we met and--
You moved in, didn't you?
Well, it's-- it's just a very
complicated thing.
Hey, do you love me?


                                 Page 6/42

Well, there you go.
There she went.
[ Woman's Voice ]
What a huge wedding.
[ Church Bells ]
Cindy, hi.
- How are you?
- How are you?
Excuse me.
You look so pretty.!
Darn! My flash never works!
Figures. My mother-in-law gave it to me.
- [ Allen ] Get up.!
- What? What?
It was embarrassing when you were 1 0.
If something works for me,
I stick with it!
I've been thinking.
I intend to get more involved with business.
I mean that this time. I know the business.
I was there at the beginning with Dad.
Do we sell fruit and
vegetables or just fruit?
By the time I came home,
she was already gone.
- Victoria left, huh?
- Yeah.
You know why she left me?
- Because I didn't love her.
- That bitch.
Hi. Anywhere but the frst three rows.
- Anywhere but the frst three rows.
- Hey!
Hi, Freddie. Allen, where's Victoria?
She's sick, and she can't make it.
- I'm sorry.
- Hey!
Can you answer me
why I didn't love her, Freddie?
She had everything.
She was bright, sensitive, beautiful.
- Hey, Allen.!
- Hi.
- Where's Victoria?


                                 Page 7/42

- She can't make it because of the flu.
- give her my love.
- You bet! Sure.
I can't even give her my love!
Something in here is not working.
There are worse organs
not to be working. Ha!
Hi, guys. Bauer, where's your pretty lady?
She's not coming! Okay?
Do you want your money back?
Well, I don't know. Maybe it's for the best.
- Hey, Allen.
- She left me! My life's a shambles.
That's the news. Want the weather?
Anywhere but the frst three rows!
Lighten up on the guy.
That's the bride's brother.
Drinking is a matter
of algebraic ratios.
How drunk you get depends on
how much alcohol you consume...
in relation to your total body weight.
It's not that you had too much to drink,
it's that you're too skinny!
- Marceau, more drinks here.
- No.
- Freddie, I don't want to get drunk.
- But you are.
A sober person would have
reached for the pretzels.
- Is he going to be there long?
- I don't know.
- Oh, I'm on the bar.
- You're on the bar.
Come on, off the bar.
This stool is in your way. Let me move it.
Oh, oh, you fell.
That hurt. You're not having a good day.
- Wasn't that a beautiful wedding?
- That was.
It was. It really was.
- The most gorgeous ceremony--
- A lovely...

- Fine.
The fabulous Freddie Bauer here.

- She did?
- They're beautiful.
- Thank you.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You guys are in love, aren't you?
We just met.
That doesn't matter.
I know about these things.
I can see. I can tell.
You two guys, you're in love.
I think that's beautiful.
Thanks.
I don't live too far.
Let's go to my place for a quiet drink.
Do I expect too much out of life?
My dress! I can't believe this.
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, what are you doing?
Both of you. You're both crazy!
I'm sorry. Look--
I don't ask that much, do I?
I don't ask to be famous, rich,
or play center feld for the Yankees.
I just want to meet a woman...
and fall in love, and get married.
And I want to have a kid,
and I want to see him play
a tooth in the school play.
It's not much.
But I'm kidding myself.
It's never going to happen.
I'm going to grow old...
and grow lonely, and I'm gonna die:
and I'll be surrounded
by a bunch of rotten fruit.
- Freddie?


                                 Page 9/42

- No kidding!
Freddie?
Allen! I want you to meet
some friends of mine.
This is Tawny, and this is Jill.

- You're Tawny Tiger!
And this is Jill, a four-letter word.
- My brother, Allen.
- Hi.
- Freddie, can I talk to you?
- Absolutely.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
We'll whisper some more.
I've got some whispering for you!
Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god.
Pack your bags. We're going to Rio!
They have a timesharing condominium.
We're gonna share some time with them.
No, I'm going to Cape Cod.
What are you talking about?
Why would you go to Cape Cod?
Because I like Cape Cod.
I feel better up there.
I look at the water
and feel closer to something.
- Cape Cod over Rio? Are you all right?
- Yeah.
- Let me drive you up there.
- No, no.
- You got enough money?
- I've got plenty.
- Yeah?
- Thanks.
Can I have some then?
[ Tapping ]
- Where to?
- Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

Madison?
- Madison?
- Allen?
Yeah, of course, it's Allen.
What are you doing, sweetheart?
Taking a bath.
Ooo, ooo. Can I come in?
- No!
- [ Clunk ]
What was that?
Madison, are you all right?
- Everything's fne.
- Then let me in.
I'll be right there. I'm just changing.
Enough! Open the door.
Something is wrong.
Allen, can you make me some pancakes?
Make you some-- Madison.!
All right, Madison, this is getting scary.
Either open this door,
or I'll break it down!
- No, Allen, please.
-All right, that's it.!
- Allen, no!
- Ow.
Hi.
Hi. Are you okay?
Yeah.
Why wouldn't you let me in?
I was... shy.
You were shy?
After the car, elevator, bedroom,
and top of the refrigerator,
you were shy?
I was shy.
She was shy.
[ garbled Shouts ]
[ gasping ]
Hey, B.B. brain!

- Yeah?
- See this hose?
- It's so I can breathe.
- Uh-huh.
You want to get your chair off it?
Huh?
[ Laughing ]
The Star Confdential?
Yeah.
- Why are you reading that?
- I don't know.
What possesses the uneducated
to purchase these?
- Interesting.
- You're not helping yourself.
You're not-- This is not news.
give me this. You know what's in here?
Nothing. You have sex, perversion.
It's all fabrication. Look at this.
A naked woman at the Statue of Liberty.
Where would they fnd a girl to do that?
[ Laughing ]
- Ow, my head!
- Let me see that.
Take me back to shore. Now!
Hello.
Madison, what is it?
What happened?
[ Horse Whinnying On TVProgram ]
It's the saddest thing I ever saw.
[ TV, Indistinct ]
It's Bonanza.
The man killed another man
and he died in the street.
No, no. This is only TV.
I thought you understood
about TV being make-believe.
It's pretend killing that's going on.
This guy is an actor.
Next week, he'll get shot
on another show.
It's kinda funny.
I'm supposed to laugh?
Yeah.


                                 Page 23/42

There you go.
Yeah.
I got you something.
[ Sigh ]
It's beautiful. I love it.
No, you open it.
There's more?
dd [ Waltz ]
Do you like that?
Yeah, I do.
I don't know why.Just...
something about it.
It's always appealed to me.
Do you like the sea?
No. When I was about eight,
I had this accident on a ship.
I remember.
What?
Ah, I can't.
I forget the words.
What's-- ''I understand.''
[ Chuckles ]
Did you get hurt?
No, no, I didn't,
but when I was underwater,
I could have sworn I saw--
- What?
- Nothing.
- What?
- Nothing!
I was just a stupid kid.
- They're going to tear this park out.
- Why?
They're gonna build condos
or some such nonsense.
What are you gonna do, huh?
You want to go home?
No, I have fve days left!
No-no-no. My home!
Oh. Yes.
[ Allen ] Why do we want
to go to a political dinner?
- The president will be speaking.
- President of what?


                                 Page 24/42

President of the
Three Stooges Fan Club.
- The president of the United States!
- Wow.
We'll be rubbing elbows
with the big boys.
- You think big, you be big.
- I guess so.
Listen,
would you mind if I took Madison...
instead of going with you?
What?
- What?
- What?
Something in here not working?
''Oh, I'll never fall in love, Freddie.
I can't. It won't work with me.''
Who said anything
about me being in love?
You haven't been to work in two days.
- So?
- Admit it.
- No.
- Admit it!
Eye gouge!
[ Screams ]
Ahhh. Ahhh!
- Admit it. Bone crusher!
- No.
Son of a bi--
Ow.
How long we been playing?
-About fve minutes.
- Oh, god.
My heart's beating like a rabbit.
You, uh, want a beer?
No, thanks.
So, tell me this.
If you're not in love with her,
how come little things she does,
drive you crazy?
Little things?
Freddie, the woman learned English
in a single afternoon.


                                 Page 25/42

She could probably speak English already.
I think she was in shock from being arrested.
What about that, huh?
What about a woman showing up
naked in a public place?
I'm for it.
You said...
that she had some kind
of immigration problem.
She's on an ocean liner
in international waters.
She sees America. It looks good.
So, she greases her body
like a channel swimmer.
She dives in.
She has heavy trouble with sharks,
she goes through the Coast guard,
minefelds and then she's on shore.
She's okay. That's it.
What about the bathtub?
This moon stuff, and all those TV's?
Look, I'm being serious.
I admit to a few minor fascos
in my love life.
Freddie, you took a date
to one of your own weddings!
I'm a free spirit!
I'm extremely liberal,
a freewheeling dude.
You're in love with this girl. You're
trying to convince yourself you're not.
I just don't know, Freddie.
Something about it isn't right.
I'll serve.
Hold the beer. That will be your handicap.
- Oh, we're gonna play?
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna teach you a lesson in humility.
- Wait.
Humility 1 01 .
- You all set?
- Yeah.
Here we go.
Oh!


                                 Page 26/42

This is what we came to hear?
You call and tell us you have
stretched the frontiers of paleontology...
and zoology.
We interrupt important, serious work...
to fly here at a moment's notice,
and you give us mermaids.!
Don't call us.
Call the comic book companies.
Enough. We have a seminar
in three weeks. Be ready.
[ Whistling ]
Allen, you're here! I got you a present.
- Don't look. Close your eyes.
- I gotta close the door.
What are you doing?
All right.
Okay. Look.
Ha-ha! Wha-- You, ah--
Well, that's big!
Yeah, this is--
This is very... big,
and it's... really here.
It's just so big.!
They were gonna tear it down,
so I bought it for you.
Where did you get
the money to pay for it?
Madison, where's your necklace?
- I traded it for the statue.
- Why?
Because I love you.
Oh, Madison.
Madison, I love...
this, ah, present.
I love it.
And I love you.
[ Dr. Zidell ]
What's happened to you?
You were the brightest student in my class.
True, emotionally, you were 1 2 years old.
- I was 1 2 years old.
- That's right.
Look what you've become:


                                 Page 27/42

a schmuck.
There is a mermaid in New York City.
You mean this, this naked girl?
How come she's got legs?
She has legs out of water
and fns in the water.
You taught me that,
Dr. Zidell. Remember?
You taught me all the legends.
You used to show me charts
on your offce walls...
where sailors had claimed they saw mermaids.
Walter, that was for fun, for relaxation,
not for you to build your whole life on.
I'm gonna prove to you
and everyone else that...
that girl is a mermaid!
How? You gonna get her wet...
so everybody sees she has fns?
[ Chuckles ]

Oh!

[ Walter]
Excuse me.

What does he think he's doing?
Hey.! Hey.!
[ Crying ]
[ Walter ]
Oh, my--
dd [ Piano ]
- [ grunt ]
- [ gasp ]
Oops.
Nice earrings.
- Is something the matter?
- No, nothing at all.
I was thinking.


                                 Page 28/42

You don't have to leave the country.
- I do.
- You don't. There's stuff we can do...
to get around the immigration laws.
I could give you a job down at the market.
You could get a work visa.
Or, uh, you could, uh,
marry, like, an American,
and they have to let you stay.
Our food is here!
Oh. Well, we'll talk about it later.
Do be careful, madam.
The plate is very hot.
Thank you. These look terrifc.
She's really hungry!
##[''Skater's Waltz'']
You were very good.
Come on. Oops. Come on.
Let's sit down and talk.
Ah.
Your nose is cold.
I don't want to talk about my nose.
Your ears are all red!
I don't want to talk
about any part of my face.
But I do want to talk about
what happened in the restaurant.
I'm sorry.
That's how we eat lobster
where I come from.
Oh, no-no-no.
I don't care about that.
I was trying to do something in there,
and I guess I did it very badly.
I was trying...
to ask you if you wanted to get married.
Madison, will you marry me?
No.
What? No? Just no?
You don't want to think
about it, kick it around?
- I can't.
- Why?
I can't tell you.


                                 Page 29/42

I know you have some big secret you think...
you can't tell me, but you can.
- You're already married?
- Allen.
You're dying? You were once a man?
- Whatever it is, you can tell me.
- Allen.
I only have three days left.
Please make them wonderful.
Okay.
Want to skate some more?
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Allen?
You know them?
No, I'vejust seen them before.
I guess they've come here
for about 40 years.
They look very happy.
Why shouldn't they be happy, huh?
They get to spend
their whole lives together.
Is this really what happens
when water gets cold?
Yeah.
Where I come from, it never gets cold.
Well, hey, what a breakthrough!
You just really opened up to me there.
Your voice sounds funny.
It's called sarcasm.
They don't have that where
you come from either?
No.
Well, they don't have anything, do they?
They don't have ice, or music or clothes.
What kind of a place is this?
Madison?
- Madison!
- Hey, those skates are rented!
give me one second. Madison?
Ahh! Madison!
Madison, please? I'm sorry!
Let her go. Show some dignity.
Madison?

[ Thunder ]
Hey, Charlie. How's it goin'?
- Allen?
- What?
Yes.
If we get our blood test today,
we can marry tomorrow!
Before the blood test,
I have to tell you everything.
So, tell me.
- Not today.
- But see,
if we get the test today--
no pressure, mind you--
then as soon as you tell me,
we can get married.
Listen,you will love being married to me.
I was born to be married.

Their moms and dads were married too.

I thought we were going upstairs.
I love you. I'm not gonna lose you again.
We are getting married tonight.
We're gonna drive to Maryland.

You don't need
a blood test down there.
There's this dinner
with the president. Damn!
Hey, that's okay!
We'll go to Maryland after dinner.
- We'll already be dressed up!
- I haven't told you--
You haven't told me this big secret.
Tell me on the way to Maryland.
Oooh!
I hope we have a boy and a girl.
- What kind?
- Wha-- What kind?


                                 Page 31/42

The young kind, I guess.
The older ones are
a little hard to deliver.
We're getting married tonight.
- Wonderful.
- Thank you.
Why is this bread in here
instead of out there?
The butter is hard like a rock.
Do you have a broken arm?
No, it's fractured in 1 6 places.
Why are you here?
The union sent me.

what his dinner cost.

- Allen?
- Yeah?
It's time for me to tell you.
What? Now?
- Right now.
- Okay. great.
- Not here.
- Fine. Fine.
[ President ]
But more importantly, with fresh meat.
- I am not crazy.
There's a mermaid in there.
- Shut up.
- What mermaid?
- I am a scientist!
Where's the goddamn car!
The gray BMW.
[ Shouting ]
[ Indistinct ]
Hey, I know that guy.
I saw him on Cape Cod. He was crazy then.
There she is! There she is!
- Don't let him shoot that.
- That a gun?
- Hold it.!
- No!
Get that thing out ofhis hand.
Grab that hose.!
Grab him.! Get him.!
- No!
- What's going on?
I was right!
Behold the mermaid!
[ Crowd Gasps ]
Let me outta here.!
Who are you? What is your name?

- What do we do?
- grab her. grab everybody.
- I want to see her.
- Allen! Allen!

Please? Huh? People?

I guess they thought you might be one.
Yeah.
I guess so.
You said whatever my secret was,
you'd understand.
I know.
You thought at least I was a human being.

He's been in the water 1 2 hours.
He's just a man.
get him out so we
can concentrate on her.
greg Martin, W-M-E-T Radio,
here with Allen Bauer.
- When did you meet the mermaid?
- Tell me where.
Did you know she was a mermaid?
- Did you actually make love to her?
- That's a stupid question.
Did she eat worms?
Would you have to make
love to her in water?
That's none of your business.


                                 Page 34/42

Is she a mutant or missing link?
No, she's not.
I'm from People.
Is she also seeing Burt Reynolds?
For crying out loud!
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone! get out of the way!
- Let me through.
- Out of the way.
- Allen, you all right?
- Yeah. get me out.
Is anyone here from Penthouse?
- [ Reporters ] No.
- Then we ain't talking.
dd [ Car Radio ]
Hey, Allen?
What are you looking at? You never
saw a guy who slept with a fsh?
get back to work!
Mr. Bauer, you had a million messages.
I wrote them down.
You got calls from CBS, NBC, ABC, AP,
UPI, Ted Turner, Time, Newsweek,
Marineland, ''Ripley's Believe It Or Not, ''
and Mrs. Paul.
Not now, Mrs. Stimler.
''Fishman?''
Fishman!
That's what they're
calling you on TVtoo.
Personally, I think it's kinda cute.
- So, how is she?
- How is she?
She's... a mermaid.
I don't understand. All my life...
I've been waiting for someone...
and when I fnd her,
she's a fsh.
Nobody said love's perfect!
Oh, Freddie, I don't expect it
to be perfect,
but for god's sake, it's usually human!
Every day people meet and they fall in love.
Look what I got.


                                 Page 35/42

Look what you got. Yeah, let's look.
Let's take a good look at what you got.
- People fall in love every day, huh?
- Yeah.
That's a crock! It doesn't work that way.
Do you realize how happy
you were with her?
That is, when you weren't
driving yourself crazy.
Every day? Come on.
Some people will never be that happy!
I'll never be that happy.
What am I talking to you for?
You don't know nothing. Mrs. Stimler?
[ Beeping ]
Does she look a little pale?
Ah, that's a good day's work.
Tomorrow, I want to see
how she interacts...
with other marine life,
then the internal examination.
Internal?
I want to study her pulmonary system,
- reproductive organs, everything!
- Dr. Ross?
Are we considering...
how the subject is responding
to the examination procedure?
I'm considering everything!
Ah, yes,
I'm sure you are, Dr. Ross.
How stupid of me. But let me ask,
are you considering the possibility...
that you might be a sadistic pig?
While we are baring
our souls, Mr. Kornbluth,
I must honestly tell you I have never
considered you a man of science.
You're not a member of my team.
Run along, Walter.
See if you can't fnd a unicorn.
[ Door Slams ]

- What's that?

- Stay away!
Ahhh!
Ahhh! Ohhh!
Uh.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
What a week I'm having!
You've destroyed my life, Kornbluth.
I didn't mean to.
I just had to prove that I wasn't crazy.
I'm a man of science.
I just didn't think about
how it would affect you...
or her.
I'm really a nice guy.
If I had friends, you could ask them.
I've been on the phone to
every employee of the government...
calling them sons of bitches.
Nobody could even get in to see her.
I can.
Come on. Come on!
- Ahh!
- Come on.
good afternoon, Dr. Kornbluth.


                                 Page 37/42

I wasn't expecting you today.
These are Drs.Jarred and Johanssen...
from the Stockholm Institute.
I thought they were
coming later with Dr. Ross.
No, no. That story was to fool the press.
You know, I'm half Swedish.
-Ja.
-Ja.
-Ja.
- Oh,ja.
- Well!
-Just a second.
Ah.
- How the hell did you do that?
- Let me tell you.
Many nudie flms come from Sweden.
After you see them 400 or 500 times,
the stuff sinks in.
Afternoon, Buckwalter.
Sorry, no one comes in...
until Dr. Ross gets back
with them Swede people.
These are the Swedish doctors.
These are... Swedes?
Ah, come here.
Isn't that one kinda dark?
He's dirty from the trip!
- Let us in.
- I'm not supposed to.
What are you afraid of?
Do you think we're
gonna steal the mermaid?
Steal the mermaid.
Stealing the mermaid!
Are we gonna fold her in half
and put her in a briefcase?
In a briefcase. In half.
I guess it's all right.
go in. go in.
- good joke, there.
- Yeah.

- Hi.

- Hi.
Is this the big secret you've been keeping,
that you're a mermaid,
or is there something else?
No, that's it.
Allen, don't feel guilty.
guilty? About what?
About not loving me anymore.
Oh, Madison.
All the time we were together,
you always knew how I was feeling.
Can't you tell now?

- Oh, my god!
- What?
- Stand back, man.

What happened? What's going on?
Dr.Johanssen bent down
to examine that creature...
and suddenly these rays
came out of her eyes!
Don't go in there!
She'll melt your face off.
I knew something would happen.
What should I do?
- Don't whine. Seal off the area.
- I'll call the Pentagon.
You want to create a national panic?
- I don't want to die!
- Pull yourself together.
Don't let anybody in that room.

The Sure Thing
    By Steve Bloom




       Page 1/39

Consider outer space.
From the time of the first NASA mission,
it became evident...
that being in space has a profound effect
on the human psyche.
During the first Gemini mission,
some thought was actually given...
to the notion of sending up
a man and a woman together.
Really?
A cosmic Adam and Eve, if you will...
bound together
in a sophisticated nerve center...
at the head of the largest,
most powerful known rocket...
its giant thrusters
blasting into the dark void...
as they hurtled towards
their final destination:
the gushing wellspring of life itself.
How would you like
a sexual encounter so intense...
it could conceivably change
your political views?
- Would you like to dance?
- Yes, please.
I'll take that as a no.
- Consider outer space.
- What?
Private Gibson! ncoming!
What is this? ""Lonely man sitting on a hill""?
It's over, Lance.
It's gone, I've lost it.
High school.
I started off so hot.
Sophomore year, two times.
Junior year was excellent. Four times.
And not all with the same girl.
Senior year looked like the best.
The first day of classes, then nothing.
What do you mean,
nothing your senior year?
What about that time with Barbara DeVillebis
in the high-jump pit?


                                 Page 2/39

That was you.
I just can't motivate myself
the way I used to.
Maybe I'm past my prime.
It's not you.
It's these high school girls, here.
They're simple.
They're never gonna stimulate
a complex guy like you.
- Maybe you're right.
- Of course I'm right.
Anyways...
after tonight, you'll never have to deal with
these simple high school girls again.
- But won't these same girls be in college?
- Yeah, but it'll be different.
- Why?
- Because they'll be college girls.
I'm gonna miss you.
It's your own fault. You could be
coming out to California with me.
Yeah, right.
Get a totally bitchin' education
out there, dude.
California.
You could be coming
to New England with me.
What are you, crazy? The lvy League stinks.
They've only got those ugly,
intellectual girls...
with Band-Aids on their knees
from playing the cello. No, thank you.
I'm really gonna miss you.
We're college men now.
Dear Lance, the campus here is beautiful.
I've never seen so much corduroy
in one place.
Classes are classes.
One of them even looks like
it might be interesting.
You never know.
You're wrong about the women here.
I haven't seen one Band-Aid.
In fact, there's plenty of action.


                                 Page 3/39

My roommate and I have an understanding.
Hope things are going as good for you.
Your pal, Gib.
P.S. All of the above is bullshit.
I'm floundering in a sea of confusion
and total despair.
But, knock on wood, I still have my health.
This week's assignment
is to rewrite last week's assignment.
Remember, ""As the dog returneth
to his own vomit...
""so does the fool to his folly.""
Sorry I'm late,
but there was this big problem...
and I'm late because of it.
Katherine, when I told you
that you should develop your own style...
I didn't mean that you should dot the i's
with little flowers.
And this lavender ink...
Would you lose that?
It strains the eye.
You sure take a lot of notes.
Miss Duran, this is very interesting.
Ordinarily, the conclusion comes
in the end of the paper, but...
- I like that.
- Thank you.
Go on.
Gibson.
- Mr. Gibson?
- Yes, what?
I know what an important part
voyeurism plays in your daily life...
but would you mind
if I take up a moment of your time?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
See, I want to tell you...
that I really enjoyed your paper.
- You did?
- Yeah.
I don't remember the last time...
that I have seen this much detail


                                 Page 4/39

expressed on:
""How to eat pizza
without burning the roof of your mouth.""
Unfortunately, whatever whimsical qualities
that your paper evokes...
are obscured in a morass
of marginal grammar...
creative spelling...
and, as I believe, sausage stain.
Pepperoni.
Clean it up.
Ms. Bradbury.
You, on the other hand...
express your ideas very clearly.
Thank you.
Except that your paper is...
Well, it's dry.
There's not enough of you coming through.
Loosen up, Alison. Have some fun.
Sleep when you feel like it,
not when you think you should.
Eat food that is bad for you,
at least once in a while.
Have conversations with people
whose clothes are not color coordinated.
Make love in a hammock!
Life is the ultimate experience.
You have to experience it...
in order to write about it.
- Yes, Alison.
- What did you say after ""hammock""?
- I want you.
- All right.
You're a dead man, dead meat.
You'll hear footsteps.
Set!
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand, three, one thousand.
Gibson, all-pro safety out of Grambling,
makes another sparkling defensive jam.
- I thought Grambling was all black.
- So what?
What are you doing tonight?


                                 Page 5/39

I'll tell you, I am not rewriting
my English paper. I have a social life.
That's right, I forgot.
You've got to go to a mixer.
Stand in the corner for three hours,
and not ask anyone to dance.
It's the girls at this school.
All they want is to stay indoors, smoke
cigarettes and relate. I don't like them.
Why do you have to like them?
You're dead meat.
What does Taub mean, I have to live life?
In high school, I was delegate
to the mock UN in New York City.
Twice.
When I was nine,
I broke my brother's nose, boxing.
On a tour of Graceland,
I passed out in Elvis' bedroom.
I think I've done my share of living,
haven't l?
- What do you think of that guy Gib?
- I don't.
I think he's got a cute ass.
- Him?
- Yeah.
Gibson, with the interception!
And he's got some running room!
He's to the 30, to the 40...
and he's run out of bounds at midfield
by Jimbo Maccavechi!
That's Gibson's 9th interception
of this very young season.
He's having an outstanding year.
""Life's the ultimate experience.""
Forget it. She likes the intellectual type.
I'm intellectual, and stuff.
You're flunking English.
That's your mother tongue, and stuff.
The only way she'd go out with you
is out of pity.
- Mastin, you're a genius.
- Stop and go, on 1.
Break!


                                 Page 6/39

- Both y'all are dead.
- Ready down. Set.
- Hut one. Hut two. Hut three.
- Watch it, now.
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand, three, one thousand.
- Nice D.
- Go!
Nice.
- Where are you going?
- Come on!
The ball!
I'm flunking English. I was wondering
if maybe you could help me out.
Nice swimsuit.
If I flunk English, I'm out of here.
Kiss college goodbye.
I don't know what I'll do.
I'll probably go home.
Gee, Dad will be pissed off.
Mom will be heartbroken.
If I play my cards right,
I get maybe a six-month's grace period...
and then I got to get a job,
and you know what that means.
That's right. They start me off
at the drive-up window...
and I work my way up
from shakes to burgers...
and then, one day, my lucky break comes.
The French fry guy dies,
and they offer me the job.
But the day I have to start, some men
come in a black Lincoln Continental...
and tell me I can make a quick $300
just for driving a van back from Mexico.
When I get out of jail, I'm 36 years old...
Iiving in a flophouse. No job...
no home, no upward mobility,
very few teeth.
Then one day they find me, face down...
talking to the gutter, clutching
a bottle of paint thinner. And why?
Because you wouldn't help me


                                 Page 7/39

in English. No!
You were too busy to help me!
Too busy to help a drowning man!
Okay.
- Okay, what?
- Okay, I'll help you.
You will?
When?
How about tonight?
Let's see. Friday.
That's when I rearrange my sock drawer.
- Do you want me to help you, or not?
- I do.
I was just kidding, there.

-8:
- Okay.
See you then.
- Where?
- McKenzie Hall.
Great!
It's Friday night!
""I'm a freshman
at a small Northeastern college.
""l never thought those letters were true,
until a few days ago...
""l had an experience that changed my mind.
""l just had to share it with you.
""l had resigned myself
to another night of reading your magazine...
""when there was a knock
on my dorm room door.
""And when I opened the door,
I could hardly believe my eyes.
""There were two of the foxiest twins
I had ever seen...
""with long brunette hair,
legs that wouldn't quit...
""and firm tits.""
How does that sound?
Change ""tits"" to ""generous scoops
of mouthwatering flesh.""
And have them defy gravity.
Is this shirt good?


                                 Page 8/39

Yeah. You think they'll know that
""scoops of flesh"" means ""tits""?
I don't think it sounds specific enough.
Where else are you gonna find
scoops of flesh?
How's this for an opening line:
""Did you know that
Nietzsche died of syphilis?""
- How do you spell ""zucchini""?
- Z-u-c-h-i-n-i.
Nietzsche's too obscure.
How about, ""Did you know
that Shakespeare died of syphilis?""
She probably knows it isn't true.
I don't know what to say.
It's not what you say that counts,
but how you say it.
- Use sincerity. It's the best technique.
- What?
Come here.
You know, I've never met
anyone like you before.
Usually, when I meet someone new,
I feel awkward and shy.
But with you, it's different.
I can talk to you.
You know what I'm thinking, without my
having to explain it to you in fancy terms.
We speak each other's unspoken language...
fluently.
I love you.
That is the most enormous pile of horseshit
I've ever heard in my life.
- Get out of here, you piece of slime.
- No chick would ever buy it.
That's where you're wrong.
It's how I got Lucy.
- lt's horseshit.
- Effective horseshit.
Get a life.
It's true.
It's open.
I'm so far behind, I haven't even picked out
a theme for my English Lit term paper.


                                 Page 9/39

Of course I'm still coming out there
for Christmas.
You think I'm gonna leave you alone
with all those UCLA girls?
I just can't afford to fly.
My parents will only pay if I go to see them.
Don't worry. I'll figure something out.
They have this bulletin board
where they list rides.
I really want to see you.
I will send you the article
on civil liability, I promise.
Jason?
Do you ever eat food
that you think is bad for you?
I didn't think so. It's not important.
You tell me first.
I love you, too.
'Bye.
- Who's that, your lawyer?
- Someday.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
""When I recollect
my most truly excellent experience...
""recurrent images buzz through my brain:
""the big bubbles of crust
that expand right up through the sauce...
""glistening pools of oil
as still and inviting as a mountain...
""lake...
""the ropy knots of cheese
that gather to a chewy perfection...
""in the center as the slices are pulled apart.""
- lt's good.
- This is all wrong.
There's no punctuation.
It's all one sentence.
- So?
- lt's a mess.
You neglected to mention
the most important thing.
I talk about the cheese-to-sauce ratio
right there.


                                 Page 10/39

You didn't state your topic,
that this is gonna be a paper on pizza.
But that is completely inferred.
- lmplied.
- Whatever.
Look, what do you say we blow this off
and go exploring?
Nothing gets done on a Friday night.
Come on.
Where are you going?
It's too stuffy, let's go get some air.
- You can't go in there.
- I can.
This is America, you can go anywhere.
- We're not supposed to be up here.
- See that?
That's Ursa Major, the Big Bear.
- We could get into trouble.
- That's Ursa Minor, the Little Bear.
Up to the north there, that's Cassiopeia.
That's Cassiopeia?
- She was the mother of Andromeda, right?
- Who?
- Cassiopeia.
- Really? just know the names.
Andromeda's there, too, next to Cassiopeia.
Andromeda. She was the princess
who was chained to a rock.
She was to be sacrificed to a sea serpent.
- Did he get her?
- No.
- Perseus rescued her at the last minute.
- Perseus, good man.
He's up there, too, next to Andromeda.
- You know a lot about astronomy.
- Yeah.
When I was six, I wanted to be an astronaut.
You know, all the Tang you can drink.
You'll never believe what I wanted to be
when I was six.
- A classics professor.
- No.
I wanted to be a princess.
You know, Alison,


                                 Page 11/39

I never met anyone like you before.
Usually, when I meet someone new,
I feel awkward and shy.
But with you it's different.
I feel I can talk to you.
You know what I'm thinking, without me
having to explain it to you in fancy terms.
We speak each other's unspoken language...
- What?
- ...fluently.
I love you.
What?
- Did I hurt you?
- No.
I'm sorry!
You're not.
You had this whole thing planned.
Excellent.
- What?
- Don't you have an 8:00?
- What time is it?

-7:
Shit!
Oh, God!
Wait up.
I feel really terrible about Friday night.
I was rude, insensitive, selfish...
- Asshole.
- Exactly.
But that wasn't me.
I don't know why I said those things,
I'm really not like that. Please.
I'm really sorry.
Can you forgive me?
Please.
Come on, we're gonna be late for class.
""He was a man, that's all.
""A man like any other man.
""A man like no other man.""
- That's very interesting, Marsha.
- Thanks.
You have a feel for ambiguity.
Anyone else want to volunteer?


                                 Page 12/39

- Me?
- Give me your paper.
Here you go.
- No pepperoni today?
- lt's clean.
""l am a freshman
at a small Northeastern college.
""l never thought these letters were real...
""until a few days ago, when I had
an experience that changed my mind.
""l just had to share it with you.""
- Miss Taub, I don't think that you-
- Take it easy.
""l am 6'2"", with dark hair...
""athletic build from football, and I'm
considered good-looking by my friends.
""I'm not boastful, but I must explain...
""for the sake of clarity,
that I am relatively well equipped...
""with 10 inches of solid man-meat.
""Still, it has been a dry season
as far as girls were concerned.""
I'll get it.
- lt's for you, Gib. Long distance.
- Thanks.
I'm coming.
Buddy, you getting any?
I'm talking to you cordless.
What are you doing for Christmas break?
I do. You're coming to California.
What don't you know?
My roommate's got a convertible.
We cruise to Palm Springs.
I got exams after Christmas.
We are talking SoCal, here.
It's 80 degrees outside.
My roommate's got this beach house
in Malibu.
I can't afford the flight.
Listen. Can you hear that?
Hear that?
Those are waves calling out to you.
They're beckoning.
- ""Come to California.""


                                 Page 13/39

- lt's too sunny out there.
There's a certain someone
I want you to meet.
Forget it.
She's a very special person.
I can't deal with striking out on both coasts.
You're not gonna strike out.
She was released from parochial school.
She's in her experimental phase.
Will you forget it?
- She loves sex.
- What does she look like?
You remember that last snapshot
I sent you?
The blonde in the string bikini? Get it.
- I can't right now.
- That's an order, Private Gibson.
Excuse me.
That's new.
- Yeah.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
- Good. Now look at it.
Fixate on it.
- Are you fixating on it?
- I'm fixating.
- Are you sitting down?
- Yes.
She's a sure thing.
A sure thing.
I don't need to explain
the deep significance of those words.
I told her all about you,
and she's dying to meet you.
But you gotta drag your ass out here
by the 22nd...
because she's leaving the next day
for a semester at sea.
So, think you can make it?
- Are you Gib?
- Yeah.
Hi, welcome aboard.
- I'm Mary Ann Webster.
- And I'm Gary Cooper.


                                 Page 14/39

But not the Gary Cooper that's dead.
Hop in.
- Alison, this is Gib.
- And Gib, this is Alison.
I knew I should've taken the bus.
What, and wind up
sitting next to some sleazebag?
Some sleazebag you don't know?
- You two know each other.
- We're old friends.
We're not old friends. We're acquaintances.
Very distant acquaintances.
Kids, come on.
Let's make this a fun trip, okay?
- You guys know any show tunes?
- That's a great idea.
When the moon is in the Seventh House
And Jupiter aligns with Mars
Then peace will guide the planets
And love will steer the stars
This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
The age of Aquarius!
Button up your overcoat
when the wind is free
Take good care of yourself
you belong to me!
Come on, everybody.
Eat an apple every day, get to bed by 3:00
Take good care of yourself
you belong to me!
Do the ""ooh-ooh's.""
Be careful crossing streets
Don't eat meats
Cut out sweets
You'll get a pain and ruin your tum-tum
I never met anyone like you before.
Usually, when I meet someone new...
I feel awkward and shy.
But with you it's different.
I feel I can talk to you.
You know what I'm thinking, without me
having to explain it to you in fancy terms.
We speak each other's
unspoken language fluently.


                                 Page 15/39

Before you go any further, let's be honest.
You want it. I want it.
You know I want it.
You don't have to bullshit me to get it.
And even if you do bullshit me,
you still get it.
Wear your flannel underwear
when you climb a tree
Take good care of yourself,
you belong to me
Honey, what's the matter?
You're not singing.
I'm not gonna sing
if they're not gonna join in.
- Come on, honey-
- No, they're ruining it for everyone.
What do you think you're doing?
- I'm going to bed.
- Not with me, you're not.
I'm not going to bed with you.
I'm going to bed
in a bed that you happen to be in, also.
I won't try anything, I swear.
Trust me.
You are sleeping on the floor.
I worked out a schedule.
- lt's not my schedule.
- lt's both of ours.
They never shut up.
What does she see in him?
It's a twisted relationship.
- You want to sleep in the bed?
- I do.
Fine, I'll sleep on the floor.
You don't have to sleep on the floor.
- Do you intend to sleep in the bed?
- I do.
Then I intend to sleep on the floor.
Good night.
- Great breakfast.
- Protein, good for you.
Cheese balls, anyone? Gary? They're good.
- Cheese balls?
- No, thank you.


                                 Page 16/39

You would think that was funny.
As a matter of fact, I think that's hysterical.
I think it's a scream. An absolute laugh riot.
- What the hell's the matter with it?
- lt's stupid.
Everything's stupid with you.
All right. It is stupid. What's wrong
with being stupid once in a while?
Does everything you do
always have to be sensible?
Gary, they're at it again.
Haven't you ever thrown water balloons
off the roof?
Didn't you ever sprinkle lvory Flakes
on the floor...
because you wanted it to snow in July?
Didn't you ever get really shitfaced,
and make a complete fool out of yourself...
and still have an excellent time?
Gary, do something.
Don't you feel great when
you do something totally spontaneous?
Something totally off the wall?
Spontaneity has its time and its place.
Alison, do you know what you are?
- You're repressed.
- I'm not repressed.
You are.
- I can be as spontaneous as anyone.
- Prove it.
What do you want me to do?
- I don't have to prove anything to you.
- You can't. You're repressed.
You don't have to be stupid
to be spontaneous.
- Repressed.
- ls that spontaneous?
- Sticking your butt out of a car?
- Repressed!
Face it, you're repressed.
You want spontaneity?
- I'll give you spontaneity!
- Repressed!
I'll give you... Watch this!


                                 Page 17/39

You guys!
What in Sam Hill?
Twist and shout!
Come to mama, boys!
Oh, dang!
I'm getting a hive.
""lndecent exposure.""
""Driving so as to endanger.""
""Driving with a load
not properly tied down.""
- Here.
- Thank you, Officer. I'm very sorry.
What the hell are you doing?
- Lock the doors.
- Let's be reasonable, Gary!
You can't do this! You can't leave us here!
You can't. Gary, please!
- I'm pleading.
- Lock the doors!
I'll do anything!
I'll sing show tunes!
Feelings, nothing more than feelings
Trying to forget my feelings
Feelings of love!
They'll be back.
Just a little mad.
There's a town up ahead.
I saw a sign. We can hitch.
Where you going?
We're in the middle of nowhere, cold,
there's no cars! You stay and hitch.
- You gonna walk? t's almost 20 miles.
- And don't follow me!
Fried pork rinds, anyone?
This doesn't change anything, okay?
Suit yourself.
You know, junk food really doesn't deserve
the bad rap it gets.
Take these fried pork rinds.
This particular brand
has one percent of the RDA...
that's ""recommended daily allowance,""
of riboflavin.
You ever noticed


                                 Page 18/39

there's three kinds of junk food?
There's your starchy, fried, greasy type...
Listen, I appreciate the food.
But I'm not in the mood...
to listen to any more
of your scientific observations.
You didn't have to come over here
and sit down.
You're right. I didn't.
Want a ride?
I wouldn't take that ride, if I were you.
You're not me.
Hello!
- How far are you going?
- Los Angeles.
Los Angeles is a long way
for a little girl like you to be going.
This thing's like an old woman.
You've got to kick her to get her in gear.

I got up at 6:
and I've been driving ever since.
You're the first person I've talked to all day.
Wish I could say that.
I hope he gets a ride, but some people
just don't know when to put a lid on it.
A day like this, you get to thinking
you're the only person on Earth.
It gets lonely on the road.
I know. I can't wait to get to California
to see my boyfriend.
I got my CB. But that's not real talk.
- lt's not a real person, just a voice.
- Let's see if l...
You never get to know what they look like,
or who they are.
...by Thursday night,
or Friday morning at the latest.
You look nice.
Why are we stopping here?
What are we doing?
It gets lonely on the road.
- Don't touch me!
- Don't be scared.


                                 Page 19/39

- I wouldn't hurt you.
- Don't!
Thanks for the ride.
I've been out here all day.
Am I interrupting anything?
Me and the wife
are just having a little squabble.
It's not easy getting rides, you know?
Most people are afraid
to pick up hitchhikers.
You never know who you might pick up.
I mean, I could be some crazed slimeball.
I mean, a real deranged, violent psycho.
You know what I mean?
I mean, a guy
who would rip your heart out...
and eat it, just for pleasure!
I'm talking about a total maniac!
Do you know what I mean?
Why aren't we moving?
Don't you want to give me a ride?
- I'm only going about another mile.
- Then what the hell did you pick me up for?
You think I got nothing better to do
with my life...
than to sit here
and to pass the time with you?
Shitbrain!
I don't think I want this ride after all.
And I think I'll take your wife,
if you don't mind.
- Shit.
- The luggage!
Gib, are you okay?
Told you you shouldn't have taken that ride.
- That's because you know everything, right?
- That's right.
Then you should also know
that you make it virtually impossible...
for anyone to be grateful
for anything nice you might have done.
I'm sorry, okay?
- Yeah.
- You okay?


                                 Page 20/39

Why did you get on the back of that truck?
Because I'm the kind of guy
that likes to live on the edge.
I just want to get on that bus,
and tilt the seat back...
and fall asleep, and wake up in California.
Check out those guys.
Wonder what they majored in.
- Where to?
- Los Angeles.
That'll be $89.50.
- Bus number 33, now boarding outside.
- Thank you.
- Where to?
- Nowhere. Just browsing.
Tell me, those guys over there?
Do they sleep here all night?
Come on, I want to get a good seat.
Where to?
Where's your ticket?
I've been thinking it over. I'm gonna hitch.
The way I see it,
I'm not getting any younger.
This could be my last chance to see
the real America, really relate to the people.
Loan me $1.
Change a $5?
- How much money do you have?
- That's $1.
- I got money.
- That's $2.
- How much?
- Enough.
- Can you loan me $1.23?
- Sure.
How much do you got there?
$18.77.
How did you expect to get to California
on $18.77?
I'll get by.
I have $20. You can have $50.
- I can't take that.
- You can. Come on.
You can pay me back


                                 Page 21/39

after Christmas. Take it.
- I won't forget this.
- You will. But I'll remind you.
Last call for bus number 33,
leaving for St. Louis...
Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Albuquerque,
Tucson and Los Angeles.
There's your bus. You better hurry.
Are you sure you'll be okay?
Don't you worry about me.
You go have a good trip.
- See you.
- 'Bye.
Back. Give Hercules some room.
Hercules stands no chance
against the sea monster.
Anything good on?
- Your bus just left.
- I know.
Why weren't you on it?
I'm the kind of gal
who likes to live on the edge.
We're gonna have to use a towel, here.
This could get very messy,
if you don't know what you're doing.
This is called shotgunning beer.
It's an ancient tribal custom.
Originated in Southeast Asia, I believe.
Take the beer.
Poke a hole in it, as I will do now...
using any household appliance.
I'm using a pen.
Make it just big enough
to fit your mouth over it.
Eighty-six the pen, and then in one swift...
Now listen to me, it's very important.
In one swift, deft motion,
you're gonna take it...
pull it up, and then release the cork.
Not the cork, this thing...
and all the beer will slide down
to your throat in two seconds.
- Now wait. Are you sure you're ready?
- I'm ready.


                                 Page 22/39

For all you kids watching,
this is very dangerous.
Let's not try this at home, all right?
- Sure you're ready?
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- lt's good for you.
- Mom, forgive me.
Swallow, swallow!
""Danger, Will Robinson!""
- Definite shotgun potential.
- But it went up my nose.
For a beginner,
it's amazing what you just did.
Really nice.
Really?
I just remembered, I got to check something.
Listen, tonight I'll sleep on the floor.
- I don't think so.
- I don't want any arguments from you.
I mean, it's only fair.
Last night, I slept on the bed...
Jason, I don't think so. It's gonna take me
a bit longer than I anticipated.
Today's the 19th. Better not expect me...
till the 22nd or 23rd, at the earliest.
Everything's fine. Really.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Promise.
I miss you, Jason.
I've got this great big bed,
and no one to share it with.
- What are you doing?
- I'm going for a walk.
- lt's almost midnight.
- lt's too stuffy in here.
I'm here.
Are you 21?
Okay, Dr. Levinson, what'll it be?
Double bourbon and a beer chaser.
Come on, Giblet, one more time.
I can't. Tomorrow, I promise.
It was so good.
It was so masterful. Relentless...
but with a delicate touch.


                                 Page 23/39

Confident. Creative.
I was overwhelmed.
You're a true artist.
Just let me sleep awhile, regain my strength.
Five minutes. A grace period, if you will.
Please.
What the heck.
Howdy.
- Mind if I sit here?
- Sure, buddy, go ahead.
Thank you kindly.
- Two beers.
- And another double bourbon.
I got one of them sweepstakes flyers
in the mail today...
and I can't figure
if it's worth the effort to send it in.
You think I should bother?
Probably not.
She says she's from Paris.
I don't believe that.
Paris women...
don't give you a hard time, like they do here.
To a Paris woman, sex is an art.
I was in Paris once, with my wife.
Boy, am I glad she's dead.
One tequila eggnog.
I had fried food again for lunch today.
I know I shouldn't have had it...
but I couldn't help myself.
You think I lack self-discipline?
What's wrong with me?
I'm a good-looking guy.
You are a good-looking guy.
And I'm a good-looking guy.
- You are.
- I am.
We're all three good-looking guys.
That's right. We are.
And it's Christmastime,
and I'm gonna buy you a drink.
- What are you drinking?
- Something light.
- What, like a nice Chablis?


                                 Page 24/39

- A spritzer.
Barkeep, give this man a trough of spritzer.
And you, cowboy guy,
what do you want to drink?
- I'll have a beer.
- Get cowboy guy a beer.
It's on me tonight. Drinks are on me.
They're on me.
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
and folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows
that turkey and some mistletoe
Where've you been?
This guy, Jason...
may be a real brain and all,
but can he do this?
Don't worry, Mom, I'll take the garbage out
in the morning, I promise.
Chestnuts roasting on the fire
Come on, let's go.
- Okay, do you have everything?
- I have everything. You have everything.
- Sure?
- We all have everything. Everything's fine.
- Let's go.
- You can't rush me.
She's checking under the thing.
What is under there, I don't know.
- A bathroom. Again with the bathroom.
- You can't rush me!
We've got to travel by day. So let's go.
- Look at the time. We got to go.
- We're all proceeding, here.
- Just check everything.
- We got everything, here.
We're out of here.
God, I'm starving.
- How does it feel?
- Needs more bulk.
We can't eat for 200 miles.
What are you telling me, woman?
- I worked out a schedule.


                                 Page 25/39

- Another schedule. Great.
I computed
exactly how much money we have...
how long it'll take us to get there,
how many meals we have to have.
It came out to one meal every 200 miles.
After 700, though, we can have a snack.
Good. Cheetos in Albuquerque.
I can hardly wait.
- What do you think, nine months?
- More like 15.
Excellent. Very pregnant.
- What are you gonna name it?
- What?
The baby.
The baby.
If it's a girl, Cynthia.
And if it's a boy...
Elliot.
Those are lovely names.
Elliot? You're gonna name the kid Elliot?
You can't name the kid Elliot.
Elliot is a fat kid with glasses
who eats paste.
Not gonna name the kid Elliot.
Got to give him a real name.
Give him a name.
- Like Nick.
- Nick?
Nick's a real name. Nick's your buddy.
Nick's the kind of guy you can trust,
someone you can drink beer with.
Kind of guy who doesn't mind
if you puke in his car.
- God.
- Vomit, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
- Merry Christmas to you.
I'm gonna have a huge orange juice,
three eggs, two sides of bacon...
home fries, four pieces of toast,
and then lunch!
You sure we can eat?
I don't know if we've gone 200 miles.


                                 Page 26/39

I don't want to throw your schedule off.
Leave me alone. I'm a pregnant woman.
How could you lose your money?
- I put it in my schedule book.
- How could you lose your schedule book?
That's the most important thing in your life,
that stupid book!
You wouldn't even remember your name
without it. This is just excellent!
I'm starving.
Thank you.
I'm freezing to death.
My feet are killing me.
I just swallowed my gum.
Your incessant complaining
isn't doing us any good.
Can't you try and look on the bright side?
Over there!
Over there. There's a trailer, come on.
It's locked! This is very good.
It's important that this place
should have an airtight security system...
in the middle of nowhere!
Wait, I might have a nail file.
I have a credit card.
Credit cards work
on a completely different kind of lock.
I don't think you understand.
I have a credit card.
You have a credit card?
My dad told me, specifically,
I can only use it in case of an emergency.
Maybe one will come up.
Too bad this is the only place
that takes credit cards.
Real shame.
Here, try some of my veal.
Only if you try some of this salmon.
I'm not a big fish guy, so you take it.
I'm not gonna eat that, but you try the veal...
- I'm not gonna-
- Try it.
It's good? See, I told you.
So, you were saying?


                                 Page 27/39

Anyway, my father... He grew up on a farm.
He always thought it was a real shame
that we only saw the suburbs.
He used to take us on great camping trips.
Want more wine?
One night, I was sleeping in my pup tent
with my younger brother.
I must have been, what, six or seven.
I woke up in the middle of the night,
and I had to get outside.
I don't know why.
I just really wanted to go outside.
It was dark. I mean, totally dark.
Not like in the city, or even in the suburbs.
I'm talking absolute blackness.
You couldn't see
two inches in front of your face.
But there's one thing you could see.
Millions of things, really.
You could see the stars.
There were more stars out that night
than I've ever seen since.
Believe me, I've looked.
I'm standing there,
looking up at the sky, and I'm thinking...
that each one of these dots of light
is another world.
I didn't know the difference
between the stars and the planets, then.
But it made me feel really small.
Lonely.
Do you know what I mean?
Then I thought,
maybe on each one of these other worlds...
there's a kid like me.
Only, he's shaped like a sponge...
or a pinball machine, or something.
Whatever, but he's up there.
Maybe he's on a camping trip,
and he's looking up at the stars.
I decided I want to meet this guy.
- A rose for the lady?
- Would the lady care for a rose?
Would the lady care to advance


                                 Page 28/39

the gentleman the cost of a rose?
Put it on the bill. That'd be great.
For you.
- Thank you.
- lt was nothing.
You don't have to sleep on the floor.
What?
You don't have to sleep on the floor.
Are you sure?
I won't try anything, I swear.
I trust you.
Good night.
How's your lawyer?
My lawyer?
What's his name? Jimmy, Jeremy.
Jason.
How is Jason, anyway?
Jason's fine.
- I guess you really miss him.
- I haven't seen him since last summer.
What's he like?
Jason is very directed. He's a real achiever.
I know, but what is he like?
I mean, what kind of beer does he drink?
Is he funny? Does he make you laugh?
- He is everything a girl looks for in a guy.
- He sounds perfect.
We both want the same things out of life.
We're both gonna be lawyers.
Damn good ones.
We might even open a practice together,
up in Vermont.
- Somewhere in the country.
- I get it.
Jason is the real outdoorsy type.
Clear, freshwater streams,
fragrant meadows...
biodegradable toilet paper, the works.
It's just that we both like old farmhouses.
We thought it'd be nice to find one
and restore it ourselves.
Jason thinks
it would make a good investment.
I just want it to be nice and warm and cozy.


                                 Page 29/39

Kind of like this.
And we're both crazy about basset hounds.
I guess that sounds kind of tame to you.
It sounds nice.
Good night, Alison.
Good night, Gib.
- I didn't try anything, I swear.
- I know.
- You were on my side of the bed.
- lt's all right.
- Nothing happened.
- I know.
I'm just gonna go out
on the veranda thing for a while.
- Where you headed?
- Los Angeles.
It's your lucky day. Come on, let's go!
I got it.
So what's in California?
A girl.
- What's wrong with her?
- She's got a boyfriend.
Too bad.
- What's she like?
- Who?
- Your girlfriend.
- I don't know. I've never met her.
You never met her.
You're going across the country
to see a girl you never met.
My best friend, Lance, set it up.
Supposed to be a sure thing.
A sure thing?
A sure thing, no questions asked,
no strings attached...
No guilt involved.
A sure thing.
My whole life, I never had a sure thing.
Probably never meet her anyway.
She's gonna be gone in 24 hours.
You pay for the traffic tickets,
I'll get you in the saddle.
- Thank you.
- Thanks a lot.


                                 Page 30/39

I hope you fully appreciate the magnitude
of your impending good fortune.
I do.
Alison, where are you going?
Wait up.
What is it with you?
You haven't said two words to me
since Arizona.
- See you around.
- That's it?
- ""See you around""?
- lsn't that what you want?
No questions asked? No strings attached?
No guilt involved?
Have fun with your sure thing.
- I bought this for you.
- I bought it!
It's the thought that counts.
Here we are.
Here, let me take that from you.
It's really great to see you.
I cleared out this drawer for you.
And you can use this half of the closet.
I bought some of those hangers
you like so much.
We'll just put your bags up there
after you've unpacked...
get them out of the way.
It's so good to see you.
Look.
Flannel sheets.
You know, the longer you use them,
the softer they get.
By the time we find our farmhouse...
my goodness,
they'll be incredible, won't they?
Are you all right?
Yes. Great.
- I guess I'm just exhausted from the trip.
- Tired.
Those sheets are great.
- I know what you need.
- What?
A good hot mug of tea.


                                 Page 31/39

Restores both body and spirit.
Let's see what we have this week.
Let's see, we've got some Darjeeling...
English Breakfast.
That's more of a studying tea, isn't it?
Let's see, Lapsang Souchong,
for those rainy mornings.
Earl Grey.
Remember that camping trip to Vermont?
Of course. China Black.
How about a good hot mug of China Black?
Do you have any beer?
Walter Gibson.
Private Gibson, incoming!
How are you doing, buddy?
- How are you?
- Good to see you. Looking good.
Looking good. Glad you made it.
Welcome to California...
home of the waves and the babes.
I want you to meet some people.
Guys, this is Gib, the guy I told you about.
I said he'd make it.
- Hey, dude.
- Nice to meet you.
I really respect that.
Tonight is the night, Gib, man.
- Merry Christmas.
- I love you.
I don't think she believes me.
- Why is that, man?
- I don't know.
You are gonna love California.
You ever make it with an avocado?
Party!
Gin.
Let's see, that makes 25 for me...
plus...
so, 25 plus 43 is...
Can I borrow that?
Sorry.
There you go.
...which makes the score 233 for me...
and 8 for you.


                                 Page 32/39

Charming.
It sounds like someone's having a party.
Let's go. It'll be fun.
You know how we feel about parties.
They're hot, loud and crowded.
The only reason anyone goes to them
is to pick someone up.
Now, why would we want to do that?
- Let's go to Disneyland.
- Disneyland is for children.
Let's do something pointless,
something totally crazy.
- All right. I tell you what.
- What?
I'll spot you 50 points.
That'll add some excitement to the game.
I really don't want to wear this stuff.
I really don't.
- What do you mean? You look fantastic.
- Come with me.
What's the first thing you'll do
when you meet her?
Shave my head
and join a Polynesian monastery.
- What do you mean?
- Tito. Isn't that nice?
- What are you doing?
- Like that?
- What's going on?
- I look like a moron.
What do you mean, you look like a moron?
Look at me.
You don't like green? s that it?
- I'll get you blue, or the red.
- I don't want anyone.
- Come on.
- Because I don't.
What do you mean, because you don't?
What is that?
You know what?
You happen to be developing
a very bad attitude, young man.
Don't move, because she's here.
It's her. Look.


                                 Page 33/39

Tonight is the first night
of the rest of your sex life.
You're gonna kill me.
I don't think I can go through with this.
- I knew it. The breasts are too small?
- Breasts are fine.
- Hi, how you doing?
- How are you?
- This is a drink for you.
- ls that him?
- Yeah.
- He's cute.
He's kind of going through
a little climate adjustment.
And so we're gonna be with you
in just a minute.
So why don't you just go over there
and look for something, okay?
- All right.
- I love you, babe. You look good.
What's the problem?
What's wrong with you?
I don't know. I'm almost 19.
Maybe I'm getting too old for this.
What do you want?
A goddamn relationship?
I don't know what I want.
- Maybe it's a moral issue.
- Moral issue?
This is Lance you're talking to.
You have no morals.
You're just in a slump, that's all.
It happens to the best of us.
It could happen to me someday.
I doubt it, but it could. You nervous?
Get out!
You're nervous,
because you haven't done it in a while.
It's like riding a bike.
You just got to climb on and keep pedaling.
And wear something white at night.
You want a relationship? That's fine.
Just remember that every relationship
starts with a one-night stand.


                                 Page 34/39

You came 3,000 miles for a reason,
didn't you?
Would you look at that reason?
Go for it, you've earned it.
- Lance, you're right.
- That's right.
I'm not being unfaithful to anyone.
Hell, I could use a torrid night
of cheap, meaningless lust.
That's right, buddy. There you go.
Look at these people.
They probably think
they're having a good time.
Let's dance.
- Since when do you like to dance?
- Since tonight.
That's a nice shirt.
From Hawaii.
It's been a long time
since I've held you like this.
I know.
Lance said you were very shy around girls.
Did he mention what a great dancer I am?
What else did Lance tell you about me?
He says you're a real gourmet.
- And you're a virgin.
- What?
He thinks you might be gay.
I didn't say it. Lance said it.
Excuse me, won't you?
I have to go kick the shit out of someone.
Just one second.
- You told her I was a virgin?
- I exaggerated a little.
Girls like virgins.
They find them a challenge.
- You told her I was gay!
- lt's a bigger challenge.
Keep your shirt on, buddy,
you're doing great.
Excuse me. I see a sweet young thing
whose sarong needs adjusting.
Get out of my life.
Excuse me, I'd like to get some punch.


                                 Page 35/39

Please, allow me.
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.
She's got lovely skin, and so much of it.
She happens to be an excellent judge
in quality shirt wear.
She should try wearing one, sometime.
- Would you like a cup for Justin?
- Jason.
- Whatever. He probably eats paste.
- Justin's twice the man you'll ever be.
Jason.
- He's loyal, he's trustworthy-
- Housebroken?
Do you know this person?
Not really.
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.
Jason, let's go to bed.
Careful, she hogs all the blankets.
- You snore.
- Not tonight, I won't.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
How would you like to go up
to Lance's room for a drink?
All right.
Let's go.
Good night.
- He doesn't even know that girl!
- How do you know that guy?
It was all set up by his friend.
He thinks love is something
you order on the phone, like a pizza!
- How do you know he snores?
- He thinks he knows all about stars.
He doesn't know Cassiopeia's
the mother of Andromeda.
- How's he know you hog the blankets?
- The crap he eats...
cheese balls and beer for breakfast!
How do you know
what he eats for breakfast?
Come on in.
Want to sit down?


                                 Page 36/39

- Do you want me to?
- Why don't you sit down?
All right.
- Do you want a drink?
- Sure.
Great.
Thanks.
That's strong.
Lance sure does drink a lot of beer.
A lot of it's imported.
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Why, don't I look fine?
- I don't know, it just seems like-
- I'm not.
- ls it that girl at the punch bowl?
- No.
It's nothing.
Particularly not that girl at the punch bowl.
Why didn't you tell me about him?
Because he's not worth mentioning.
He's a creep.
You made love to him, didn't you?
- Did you make love to him?
- No.
- Honest?
- Honest.
Do you love him?
I have to go to the library. I'm really behind.
That's what I should've done.
I didn't study all this week.
Me, neither.
Want some?
Good morning, everybody.
You're gonna have to talk to me
sooner or later.
- No, thank you.
- All right. Here we go.
I've got a very pleasant surprise today.
Comes from an unlikely source.
Walter Gibson.
It is called The Sure Thing.
""'lt could be tonight,' he thought...
""as he stood in the corner,
pretending to have a good time.


                                 Page 37/39

""He would meet her tonight.
""All his young life,
he had dreamed of a girl like this.
""5'6"", silky hair...
""trim, nubile body...""
""Nubile,"" by the way, is spelled with a ""u.""
""...nubile body

""Now, as for personality traits,
she needed only one.
""She had to love sex, and all the time.
""To arrive at this moment,

Still seeing Jason?


                                 Page 38/39

We broke up.
That's too bad.
You didn't sleep with her.
She wasn't my type.

The Kids Are All Right
       By Lisa Cholodenko




            Page 1/68

Oh, my God.
Joni, there are
so many hotties
in your class.
You are so gonna hook up
the first week.
Just because you're a 24-hour
drive-thru doesn't mean
everyone else has to be.
Hey,
she worked her ass off.
She deserves
some hot jock sausage.
Gross.
That's disgusting.
Why don't you guys
just do it and
get it over with?
What? I'm just saying.
Maybe because
we're friends.
B minus
in geometry, dude.
This shit is the bomb.
Add that shit up.
Don't be
such a bitch, dude.
Yeah.
Hey, ladies! Come on,
take it down a notch.
Hey! Hey!
What did I just say, huh?
Come here.
Come here, big boy.
Let's see what you got.
Come on, get him!
Come on, what you got?
Let's see it. Come on.
Come on, Dad.
Your pits smell
like burnt ass.
- Burnt ass?
- Yeah.
Get out of here.


                                Page 2/68

Take it to his house.
Laser, cut it out.
That's driving me crazy.
I'm not doing anything.
Calm down.
You calm down.
H i, guys.
Hey, babe.
- Hey, Mom.
- Sorry I'm late.
No, don't worry.
We just started.
Come on.
That's enough.
Oh, my God.
All in the lining.
That's disgusting.
Yeah.
We're eating.
Wow. Did they do that
laparoscopically?
That's right, smart girl.
We got them all.
Hey, whose truck is that?
Mine.
Yours?
Isn't it wicked?
Mmm-hmm.
For the business.
What business?
Oh, you mean
the gardening?
Isn't it landscape design?
Thank you very much.
I got a great deal.
It was super cheap.
Okay. Do we have any
more of the Fiddlehead?
I don't know.
I didn't look, honey.
- Hey, what's up?
- Yo, what's up, dude?
Laser, no phone calls
at the table, all right?


                             Page 3/68

Dude, I shaved my dog.
Are you still feeling it?
Yeah. Hey,
let me hit you back.
For sure.
Who's that?
That was nobody.
J ust Clay.
Can I ask you something?
What do you get
from your relationship
with Clay?
What do you mean ""get""?
Well, we just feel like
he's a little untended.
Do you think he's
the kind of person who's
gonna help you grow?
Hey, did you get started
on those thank-you notes
for the birthday presents?
Mom, you're windshield wiping.
Come on.
- Not yet, but I will.
- Okay.
I just think it's better
to knock them out
when it's fresh.
Yeah, I'll do
them tonight.
I mean, you don't want
to have to start with
an apology. You know?
Then it's embarrassing.
Mom, I know.
- It's okay, honey.
- She got it.
Let it go.
Okay. I'll let it go.
I mean,
if it was up to you,
our kids wouldn't even write
thank-you notes.
You know, they'd just


                                 Page 4/68

send out good vibes.
That's not nice.
Do you believe
our baby's 18?
No, I can't.
You big girl.
Such a big girl.
Big girl. Big girl.
Mom.
What?
Oh. Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing?
Writing my thank-you notes.
That's good.
You know,
you don't have to start
with an apology.
Yeah, that'd
be embarrassing.
That's terrible.
Hey, have you
thought any more about
making that call?
Yeah, I don't want to.
How can you not even
be curious about it?
Look, I'm leaving soon,
and I don't want to have
to deal with that right now.
Also, that could really
hurt Moms' feelings.
God, why do you
have to worry about
them so much?
They don't even
have to know about it.
Look, you can do it
when you turn 18, okay?
I never ask you
for anything.
I just don't understand
why you bought the truck now.


                                Page 5/68

Because if I'm gonna
start this business,
I need something
to haul my equipment in.
Okay.
It just seems a little
cart before the horse.
What does that mean?
Well, sweetie,
you don't have
any clients yet.
You know,
you're the one
who's always telling me
to act ""as if.""
That's true. I do.
You're right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's good you bought
the truck.
It's proactive.
Yeah.
Hey, you wanna
watch a movie?
A movie-movie?
Yeah. We haven't
done that in a while.
All right.
You know, I don't
like the guys in this one.
They're too shaved.
Don't focus on it.
Okay.
Fuck. Oh, my God.
Hey, hey, I'm cold.
I can't
breathe, honey.
Well...
Shit!
Shit!
Where's the remote?
Where's the remote?
Oh, my God.
The whole neighborhood


                             Page 6/68

heard that.
No, they didn't.
Shit.
That was a vibe kill.
Hey, hey, Brooke,
can you do me a favor?
Can you get that
Swiss chard for me?
Sure, no problem.
Thanks.
How are you?
Hey, Paul.
Hey, foxy.
Hey.
Mmm.
Flapjack, you are
smelling ripe.
Oh, sorry.
That's all right.
I kind of like it.
Oh, yeah?
It's earthy.
I've been out
in the garden hoeing.
How are we doing tonight?
It's gonna be tight.
Oh, really?
Go to work.
See you.
Hello?
- Hi.
- Is this Paul Hatfield?
Yes, it is. Who's this?
My name is Wendy Mitner,
and I'm calling from
The Pacific Cryobank.
Okay, Wendy Mitner.
What can I do for you?
I just need to confirm
that this is the same
Paul Hatfield
that donated sperm with us
between 1991 and 1993.
Yeah, I did a little bit


                             Page 7/68

of that back then, sure.
Well, as you know,
the Cryobank has a
confidentiality policy
which prohibits us
from releasing your identity
without your consent.
No... Yeah, yeah,
yeah, I knew that.
Well, we've been contacted
by a young woman
conceived using your donation,
and she's asked
if you'd be open to
having contact with her.
Yeah, I'd be conceivably
into something like that.
Yeah.
Great, Mr. Hatfield.
I'll let her know and get
back in touch soon.
Thanks.
Oh...
I mean,
I was 19 years old.
It was, like,
just so long ago.
I totally forgot about it.
I never thought
they'd ever use my stuff.
Why not?
Well, I'd use it.
Oh, baby.
It's weird.
There's a kid out there.
I mean, I'm kind of
curious, I think.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
What would you do?
I don't know.
You got to figure it out.


                                 Page 8/68

Yeah, no doubt.
All right, I got to go now.
All right.
Thanks for coming.
It was really nice.
I'll see you tomorrow.
So, drive safe.
M-E-R. ""Zoomer.""
No way.
That is so not a word.
No, it totally is.
That's not a word.
If you're gonna
zoom somewhere,
then you're a zoomer.
A person who zooms.
So that would be...
Let's see, that's 31...
Hello?
Hi.
I'm looking for
Joni Allgood.
Yeah, this is she.
Hey.
This is Paul,
your donor.
Eleven points
for Mommy.
Oh! H i.
Hey. Don't be a zoomer.
Hey.
Come back.
Is this a good time to talk?
Yeah. No,
this is great.
So, how are you?
How are you?
I'm good.
How are you?
I'm well, thanks.
Wendy at the Cryobank
was talking about maybe...
Oh, yeah. Well.
Actually, my brother


                               Page 9/68

asked if I'd call you,
because I'm 18,
and he's only 15,
which is,
you know, which is
too young to call.
Anyway, he'd like
to meet you.
You know,
if you want to.
Your brother?
Yeah. Well, technically
he's my half-brother.
Each of my moms had a kid,
you know, with...
With your...
With your sperm.
Like in both of them?
Yeah.
Like in two?
U h-huh. Like in gay.
Oh! Right. Right.
Right on.
Right on.
Yeah, cool. I...
I love lesbians.
Great.
So you wanna,
I don't know, get a bite
to eat or something?
You and your brother?
I just don't want you
to have big expectations.
Will you quit saying that?
I have no expectations,
all right?
Okay. I'm just saying.
He might be weird.
I mean, he donated sperm.
That's weird.
Well, you know,
if he hadn't, we wouldn't
be here, so respect.
Hello?


                             Page 10/68

Hey. Hey.
You're Joni, right?
H i, I'm Joni.
I'm Paul. N ice to meet you.
N ice to meet you.
You must be Laser?
Laser, yeah.
Right on.
That's a very cool name.
Thanks.
Well...
Cool.
Yeah. Yeah.
Listen, you know, feel free
to ask me anything,
anything you want.
Cool, thanks. Yeah.
Cool.
Laser, do you have
any questions that
you wanna ask?
Go ahead, shoot.
Anything.
I didn't really have any,
you know, specific questions
or anything, so...
Nothing?
Not really.
Well, I mean,
I'd love to know more
about you guys.
Everything. I mean...
So what do you do, Joni?
What are you into?
I just graduated high school,
and I'm starting college
in the fall, so...
Hey, that's great.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Yeah,
Joni's the brains
in the family.
She's got the National


                                Page 11/68

Merit Scholarship for science.
Shut the front door.
Okay, Laser, thanks.
Wow.
I'm just telling him
you're smart.
No, I just work
harder than you.
Hey, Laze, seriously,
don't sweat school, man.
I mean, I didn't do well in
school either, and I'm not
doing so badly now, right?
It's Laser. Yeah.
Sorry. Laser. Right.
It's cool.
So, what are you
into, Laser?
Laser's an amazing athlete.
Really? Yeah?
Did you ever play
any sports in school or...
I did a little
B-ball in junior high.
That's cool.
Was that it or...
Well, the whole ""team"" thing
just got on my nerves
after a while, you know?
It was like,
""Hey, let's go kick
some ass, man! "" And...
What about you?
I play soccer,
basketball, baseball.
You know,
all the team
sort of sports.
Hey, man,
I wasn't generally
bagging on teams.
I mean, teams are great.
I'm just weird that way.
I like teams.


                                 Page 12/68

They're cool.
Cool.
So this is your
place, right?
Yeah, yeah, this is mine.
It's cool.
You know,
I've been working
on it for a while.
I also have a little
organic co-op farm just
up the street here.
Just keeping it kind
of local and organic
and simple,
American food.
That's so cool.
I'm totally into local.
- Yeah?
- You are?
Yeah, Laser.
I've been trying to get
Moms, you know,
to buy local for ages.
All right.
- We're just over here. There.
- Right. Yeah.
Okay.
Is that your bike?
Yeah, yeah.
You like motorcycles?
Yeah, I love them,
but, you know,
our moms are kind
of anti-motorcycle.
By ""kind of"" he means
that they'd kill us if
we ever rode one, so...
Oh, that's too bad.
They're a lot of fun.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Cool.
- Cool.
- Yeah.


                                 Page 13/68

It was great...
Great meeting you, yeah.
N ice to meet you, too.
Yeah. It's okay,
right? Good?
Yeah, for sure.
Hey, Laser,
really nice to meet you.
Yeah, you too.
- All right.
- All right.
So long.
Bye.
Keep in touch.
Yeah.
Okay?
Yeah.
Wow. I just never
pictured him that way,
you know?
He was so cool
and interesting.
Yeah, he's all right.
What do you mean
""all right""?
Laser, you're the one
who wanted to meet him
so bad.
I know.
Yeah, so what did
you think of him?
I think he's all right.
I mean, I think he's
a little into himself.
God.
What?
You're asking my opinion.
Whatever.
We are so not telling Moms.
Why not?
Ha, ha. Very funny.
He wants to die!
He wants to die.
Remind me not to take


                              Page 14/68

heroin in Morocco.
Or Uganda.
Yeah. I hate it
when that happens.
...it is now time to call it.
Someone took my knife.
I want my knife back!
Hey, bug, come here.
We're watching
Locked Up Abroad.
I want my knife back!
Yeah, I've seen
that one. It's good.
Where you going?
Clay's.
Don't be back late.
I know, I know, I know.
Hey, hey. Come give us
a hug before you go.
H ugs.
Come on.
No, Mom.
Hug her. That's what
she's there for.
Maybe we should
just sit him down
and ask him already.
What? ""Are you
and Clay fucking?""
""Exploring"" is
a better word.
Yeah, well, so, you know,
what if they are ""exploring""?
This is the age for that.
We should be
good with that.
We should. We should.
I just don't understand
why he's exploring
with that loser.
We don't really know
what's going on. We shouldn't
jump to conclusions.
I feel like he has


                                Page 15/68

so much potential.
He's just wasting it.
What are you
trying to say?
What do you mean,
what am I trying to say?
I just, you know,
I feel like there's
some subtext here.
What are you
talking about?
You know,
""like mother,
like son""?
Both of us wandering
in the dark, aimless,
""wasting our potential.""
Honey, you're on
a whole other tangent.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
Well, you know, maybe
it hasn't risen to the plane
of consciousness for you yet.
Yeah. Maybe.
Someone took my knife.
So what were they like?
They were
really sweet kids.
The boy was this little,
you know, kind of
sensitive jock-type kid,
and the girl was
really innocent
but just whip-smart
and super, super cute.
Sounds like you
really liked them,
like you guys connected.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I kind of did.
Wow.
So how'd you leave it?
I mean, are you


                                Page 16/68

gonna see them again?
I... Hey, Brooke.
Hey, Paul.
Check these out.
- How you doing?
- Good.
Wow, look at those
strawberries, man.
They're just...
Aren't they beautiful?
I thought you should
have the first taste.
Thank you.
""I thought you should
have the first taste""
of my pussy.
I'm sorry.
Dude, I don't even
think they smoke pot.
Dude, hold up.
Come on, let's go.
Seriously.
Oh! Dude!
God, disgusting!
Come on, let's go.
It's alive, dude!
Put it back.
Fine, fine, fine.
Sweet!
Dude, we're watching this.
You think the whole
thing's like this?
Maybe...
Maybe we should
fast forward.
Laser, you left your bike
in the driveway again.
Laser, your mom
and I accept and love
you unconditionally.
You know that, right?
Yeah.
Yeah. And you know that
you can be open with us


                             Page 17/68

about anything.
Yeah, I know.
Okay.
Laser, do you
want to talk to us
about anything?
Like what?
J ust anything.
You know, anything
on your mind.
Well, there is something.
But it's more of
a question, though.
That's okay.
We won't judge you.
Why do you guys
watch gay man porn?
Well, first I have to say
that we rarely watch
that movie.
Honey.
And, second,
I really don't
appreciate
you snooping around
our room, okay?
Was that Clay's idea?
No, Mom.
Wait a minute.
I have to say, again,
I don't like him.
I know. I know.
Okay, he seems unstable.
Honey, honey,
that's not what he asked.
Do you want to answer
his question?
Yeah, okay.
Well, sweetie, you know,
human sexuality
is complicated.
And sometimes desire can be,
you know, counterintuitive.
You know, for example,


                               Page 18/68

because women's
sexual responsiveness
is internalized,
sometimes it's exciting
for us to see responsiveness
externalized,
like with a...
Like with a penis.
Wouldn't you guys
just rather watch girls
doing it, though?
Well, you would think that.
But usually in these movies,
they hire two straight
women to pretend,
and the inauthenticity
is just unbearable.
Whoa, that's enough.
Laser, your mom
and I sense
that there's some
other stuff going on
in your life.
We just want
to be let in.
What do you mean?
Are you having a relationship
with someone?
You can tell us, honey.
We would understand
and support you.
Look, I only met him once.
What do you mean once?
- Did he find you online?
- Wait.
What?
Wait, wait, who did
you meet once?
Paul. I met him with Joni.
Paul? Who's Paul?
Why was Joni there?
She set it up.
Wait, forget the set-up.
Who's Paul?


                                Page 19/68

Our sperm donor.
Did you guys think
I was gay?
No.
No way.
Of course not.
Yeah, I mean, we understand
that you'd be curious
about your biological father.
I mean,
it's completely natural.
But why didn't you tell us?
Because we knew
you'd be upset.
We're not upset!
No, no, no.
We're not. We wish that
you'd included us in
the conversation.
That's all.
You know? But...
But you met him,
and that's cool.
And now,
we can move on.
Actually,
I want to see him again.
You do?
Yeah, I was
gonna tell you.
Well, no. Okay?
No way.
No one's seeing anyone
until we meet him.
I get it, okay?
He's their biological father
and all that crap.
But it still feels
really shitty.
Like we're not enough
or something, you know?
Of course I know.
You know, I don't...
I don't want to time-share


                                Page 20/68

our kids with anybody.
Especially when
it's Joni's last summer
at home.
No way.
Jesus, Jules!
The plumber was just here.
God, it's gross.
Look, we have to be
smart about this.
You know, if we act like
grubby bitches, we're just
gonna make it worse.
I know.
Let's just kill him
with kindness
and put it to bed.
I'm with you, honey.
We're gonna get
through this, okay?
I love you, chicken.
I love you, too, pony.
Paul. It's so great
to meet you. H i. Yeah.
Great to meet you, too.
Hey. Jules.
Hello, Jules.
I'm Nic.
Hi, Nic.
Hi.
I hope the traffic
wasn't too bad.
No, I took my motorcycle,
so I pretty much just
weave through it.
Oh, great.
I brought you this.
I don't know if
you folks drink wine.
Oh, no, are you kidding?
We love it.
Wow, a Petite Sirah.
What a treat!
'86.


                             Page 21/68

Yeah. I'll get
some glasses.
All right.
Yeah. Wow.
Beautiful house.
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks.
You guys been here
a long time?
Yeah. You know,
about 10 years.
God, has it been
that long? I mean...
That's... Yeah.
You know them, yeah.
Hey, Joni.
How you doing?
Good, how are you?
Good.
Hey, man.
Hey.
What's up, man?
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah, great.
Go easy on the wine, hon.
It's daytime.
Okay. Same goes
for the micromanaging.
Okay?
So, Paul, did you
always know that...
Yes.
...that you wanted to be
in the food services industry?
I always liked food.
Oh, yeah.
No, I was asking
because I remember when
I was reading your file,
back when we were
looking for,
you know, sperm...
Can I have the potato
salad, babe?


                                 Page 22/68

Sure.
Anyway, you said
that you were studying
international relations.
Oh, yeah. Wow, that was a...
That was a long time ago.
Yeah, I was considering it,
but then I dropped out
of school.
You dropped
out of college?
Yeah, it just
wasn't my thing.
- No? Why's that?
- I don't know.
It just seemed like
a massive waste of money
after a while, you know?
I was just sitting
on my ass listening
to people spout ideas
I could just as easily
have learned in a book.
Oh.
Okay.
I'm not saying that,
you know,
I think that higher learning
uniformly blows.
You know, I think
college is great
for some people.
Joni, I'm sure
you're gonna love it.
But just... I'm a doer.
That's how I learn.
It's just me.
I'm weird that way, I guess.
Thank you.
Which is probably why
I'm in the food services
industry.
Right.
Hey, Mom,


                               Page 23/68

you see what he did
there, right?
You said ""food
services industry,""
so then he said
""food services industry.""
Yeah. I got that,
Laser. Thanks.
So, Paul,
what about your...
What about
your social life?
My social life?
Yeah, you know,
are you married, divorced,
seeing anyone?
- Mom.
- What?
We're getting
to know Paul.
It's okay.
No, no, it's okay. I...
No, I've never been
married nor divorced.
I date sometimes,
but I'm really just
kind of focused on my
restaurant right now.
- Well, that's...
- Yeah. Makes sense.
So, cheers.
Yeah. Cheers.
Excellent wine,
by the way.
Thank you.
How old are you again?
You must be the
griller of the family.
Yeah.
No, that's okay.
I like
to be positive.
Yeah.
So how'd you two meet?


                             Page 24/68

We met at UCLA.
I was a resident,
and Jules had
an emergency.
My tongue was numb.
Really? Your tongue?
Laser.
Oh, my God.
It's not nice.
No, that's not nice.
I mean, we've heard
that story 100, 000 times.
What happened
to your tongue?
I don't know.
I mean, I lost all
the feeling in my face
and my tongue.
And then, you know, I got
really nervous 'cause
I thought that I was gonna gag
and, you know,
maybe like...
Choke? Die?
Yeah, exactly.
What'd you do to help her?
I gave her a Valium,
and I told her to relax
and tried to get her to talk,
you know,
move her tongue around.
Yeah.
Actually,
she started teasing me,
and that really helped.
I was trying
to distract you.
I know. It worked.
You were really funny.
You were really pretty.
And then, you know,
my tongue started
working again.
- Sure.


                                 Page 25/68

- God, Mom, please.
Yeah.
Wow, we've been glued
at the hip ever since.
- Yeah.
- No doubt.
Yeah. Great. Great story.
Yeah, we like it.
So, N ic, you,
you're a doctor,
I know that.
But what are
you into, Jules?
What do you do?
Well, you know,
I mean, I studied
architecture in college.
Right.
But I'm not
really an architect.
I mean, I was on my way
to becoming one,
but I quit before
the kids were born.
That happens.
And then when they got
a little bit older,
I started
a Balinese furniture
import business.
Right on.
But that didn't
really work out.
Yeah,
businesses aren't easy.
Yeah.
But I'm in the process
of starting a new business.
Great, good for you.
What's that?
Landscape design.
I mean, you know,
not gardening.
I mean, you know,


                              Page 26/68

there's a gardening
component,
but, really, the real work
is in creating unique,
eco-friendly spaces
that, you know,
the surrounding,
that blend, you know,
with the surrounding
environment.
You know what I mean?
Definitely.
Most definitely.
Yeah.
Hey, Joni, did you
tell Paul about your
graduation speech?
No, she didn't tell me.
It was so full of
wisdom and hope.
Yeah.
Hey, go get it.
You know, I bet Paul
would like to hear it.
No, Mom,
I'm sure he wouldn't.
No, no, no,
sure he would.
Go on, go get it.
No, I don't want to.
Sweetie,
don't be embarrassed.
Mom, I'm not embarrassed.
Jesus, give it a rest.
J ust let it go.
I'm gonna get
some ice cream.
I'll help.
Okay.
Honey, it's your
fourth glass.
Actually, it's my third.
But, you know,
thanks for counting.


                             Page 27/68

Hey, I was...
You know, I was thinking.
I just bought this place
last year, and it's...
I mean,
the backyard's a wreck.
Would you be interested
in maybe coming and doing
some work for me?
That's okay.
- No, seriously.
- I can't...
I don't have time
to do it myself and...
Well, I mean,
that's really sweet of you,
but you should think
about it, you know.
- No, why?
- I just did.
I mean, it's all right
if you're not up for it.
It's okay.
No, I am.
I'm up for it. Yeah.
Yeah? Yeah?
Hey...
All right.
Okay.
Great.
Excellent.
Right on.
Yeah.
I'm just saying,
the plan was to limit
his involvement.
You're unbelievable.
I mean, you're all about
me getting clients.
And then I get a client,
and you're like,
""Oh, no, not him.""
Yeah. But he's not
just a client, Jules.


                              Page 28/68

He's our sperm donor.
I mean, haven't you
heard the expression
""don't shit where you eat""?
Yes, and I think
it's disgusting.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Look, he just seemed
so self-satisfied to me.
You know?
Yeah, he was working
the ""alternative"" thing
pretty hard.
Oh, my God.
When he said
that thing about,
""Oh, I just need to get
outside and do things,
not sit on my ass and learn.
""But that's just me, you know.
I'm weird that way.""
I'd certainly clean up
a lot of this grass.
It's pretty... It's wasted.
Sure.
The lavender
is so nice.
And with the sun that
you have, that and,
like, that rosemary,
which kind of grow everywhere,
and you wouldn't even have
to think about it.
Yeah.
You could go like a whole,
like, Secret Garden,
kind of a trellis-y,
like hidden kind of thing.
Or you could, you know,
you could go like Asian-y.
Minimal. You know, like rocks
and kind of all clean and...
Whatever you think.
Well,


                                 Page 29/68

what do you think?
You know what? I'm not...
I'm not feeling minimal.
I really... I'm really
liking more is more.
You know? I mean,
let's not try to tame
this space, okay?
Let's just let it be
like lush,
overgrown, fecund.
Fecund.
Like fertile, yeah?
No, I love that word.
You just, you don't hear
people use it very often.
No, yeah.
Yeah, more is more.
Yeah, I like that.
Right on.
Let's do that.
I'm sorry.
What?
I just keep seeing
my kids' expressions
in your face.
Really?
Yeah.
Like that. Like, ""Really?""
Like, yeah. That's like Laser.
Hmm.
Well...
Do you like patios?
Yeah, patios are good. Okay.
Yeah.
We could put
a patio up there.
Where?
Let's take a look.
- Hello. Donor Dad?
- Stone cold fox.
Must you take
everything beautiful
and make it dirty?


                                 Page 30/68

Okay.
I'm just saying.
Spermster's a hottie.
Is he single?
Okay.
First of all, ew,
and second,
he's a really good person.
So I'd prefer it
if you didn't taint him
with your whore juice.
Fair enough, hairy muff.
I'm out of here.
You lovebirds can
split my letters.
Do you want
to keep playing?
Sure.
Okay.
Sometimes I feel sorry
for Sasha, you know?
Yeah.
It's like she has to sexualize
every experience, you know?
It's just sad.
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
That's sad.
Oh, come on.
Hi ya, what's the score?
Pretty close.
- Yeah?
- 20 to three. Match point.
So how'd it go today?
It was good.
We settled on a concept.
Ah. What is it?
Well, you know,
it's kind of...
It's kind of hard to explain.
You really have
to see the space.
Okay. Hey, Laser,
did you write the get-well
card for Pup-pup?


                                 Page 31/68

Laser, come on.
What do I have to do?
I bought you the card.
I put it on your desk.
All you have
to do is sign it.
Mom, just settle down,
okay? I'll do it.
Hey. You don't tell me
to settle, mister.
If it's not in the mail
by tomorrow morning,
we're not going
to the Dodger game
Saturday, okay?
Whatever. I have
other plans anyways.
What other plans?
I asked you a question.
I said I'd do something
with Paul, okay? God!
Shit!
I believe this might not
be such a good idea.
Are you filming?
Yeah.
He's not gonna make that.
You're not gonna make that,
Clay. No way.
Let's do something
different.
Will you quit being
such a choch and
run the camera?
I'm only doing this once,
so keep my shit in frame.
All right.
All right, I got it.
Shit! Dude!
Clay, are you all right?
Fuck!
Did you get it, dude?
Clay,
you all right, bro?


                              Page 32/68

Seriously, are you okay?
I'm fucking fine! Fuck!
Did you fucking
get it? God!
Yeah, I got it.
- Fuck, dude.
- Clay...
That was fucking crazy.
Where's your place,
Clay, up here?
Yeah, right here
on the right.
- This is good.
- Cool here?
Yeah.
You take care.
Later.
See you.
Let's wait till
he gets to the house.
Maybe we could
hang out together just
you and me next time.
Clay's cool. He just...
You know, he gets
a little amped sometimes.
That's not amped, man.
That's being a tool.
No, he's not a tool, okay?
That's just his way.
Yeah, I don't like the way
he was talking to you at all.
Well, you know what?
You don't know him
very well, do you?
I mean, you hung out
with him once.
You're right.
I don't know him.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Why'd you donate sperm?
It just seemed like
a lot more fun than


                                Page 33/68

donating blood.
No, I loved the idea
of helping people.
People who were in need,
you know, wanted to
have kids and couldn't.
So then you did it
to help people?
It was a long time ago.
How much did you
get paid?
Why do you want
to know that?
I'm just curious.
I got paid 60 bucks a pop.
That's it?
Well, it was, like,
a lot of money to me
at the time.
And with inflation,
it's like $90 today.
Hey.
I'm glad I did it.
Whoa.
What's this?
H i. Come here.
Come here. Sit down.
I'm sorry that
I've been so edgy lately,
you know.
I know I haven't
been my highest self.
Yeah.
And you've been
really patient with me.
And I just want you to know
that that hasn't gone
unrecognized, okay?
How's the water?
It's perfect.
You wanna come in?
In a minute.
You enjoy it first.
I forgot


                              Page 34/68

the lavender bath salts.
Oh, I don't care.
No, no, no.
I wanna get them.
I got them special.
Don't go. Don't.
Don't move.
I'll be right back.
Nic?
Hey, Nic?
Jesus!
U h-huh.
Right. No,
I understand.
I understand where
the pain is, but it doesn't
sound like a contraction.
It sounds more like gas.
I'm sorry.
Fuck!
Right. Okay.
All right, this is our plan.
I don't think
you should worry,
and I think you should
just call me back
if it continues.
You sure you don't
want any coffee?
No thanks.
It's good.
I'm all right.
But I think I'm gonna go
to the nursery tomorrow,
so I want you
to sign off on
this Bougainvillea.
Sure.
What is this?
Did you make it?
Yeah. That's some pie I made.
It's right from my garden.
It's strawberry-rhubarb.
Here. Try.


                                Page 35/68

Yeah, okay.
Twist my arm.
Oh, my God.
It's good, huh?
That's criminal.
Have some more.
No. No, please,
just take it away.
Come on.
You had one bite.
No, if I have one more,
you're gonna have to tape it
to my ass 'cause that's
where it's gonna end up.
Hey now, don't go
negative on your ass.
No reason for that.
You're good with
the plants, then?
'Cause, you know,
I can change it.
If you're not happy with it,
we can do something else.
No. No, no. I'm...
We can get whatever
you want, you know?
I'm just thinking.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
I'm good with them.
They're great.
Oh.
They're great.
Sorry.
Sometimes I mistake
silence for criticism.
I wasn't criticizing you.
No, no, I just, you know...
Sometimes Nic can be
a little critical 'cause
she's a perfectionist.
Well, I don't see why
you'd take it that way.
I think you're
really talented.


                               Page 36/68

Really?
Really.
Excuse me, seora?
Yeah?
Okay, thanks.
Same time tomorrow?
Yeah. Same time tomorrow.
Good night.
Thank you. Okay,
good night. Thank you.
Whew!
I should get going, too.
Same time tomorrow?
That's mean.
Take this.
No. U h-uh.
I don't want it.
Take it.
No.
For the kids.
No. I don't want it.
Come on.
No. God,
you are such a pusher.
Oh!
Wow. Okay.
I don't know where
that came from. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry. I...
J ules.
I'm gonna just go and...
It's okay.
No, I just...
It's okay.
It was okay.
But I shall return!
What?
So how'd it go
with Paul today?
What do you mean?
Well, did you break ground?
Did you dig in?
I don't know the terms.
We just talked,


                              Page 37/68

conceptually.
Oh, wow.
So it was
less of a ""doing"" day?
Was he okay with that?
You know, I think
we should lay off
the Paul digs a little.
Oh, okay.
And I also think
we should start
composting.
Hey, take this.
Thanks.
You got that fair skin.
You don't have
my peasant blood.
Ignore.
Who's that?
My mom, N ic.
She's driving me crazy.
Yeah? What's she doing?
She's treating me
like I'm 12.
It's like
she doesn't want to admit
that I'm an adult.
Well, that's your mom.
That's her job.
What? To smother me to death?
That's not her job.
If you want things
to be different,
you got to do that,
make that happen yourself.
That's your job.
Yeah.
Do you like peppers?
Yeah.
Thanks.
There's no way,
dude. You missed it by,
like, 20 feet.
Well,


                                Page 38/68

if Paul wasn't there,
I could have made it.
That guy creeps me out.
He's kind of a fag, dude,
trying to act like
your dad and shit.
Whatever, all right?
Hey, buddy. Hey.
I've seen this dog
around here before.
I think he's lost.
Let's pee on his head.
What? No.
Where you going?
Dude, what are you doing?
Dude, just hold him.
Dude, quit it.
""Dude, quit it.""
Go on, get out of here! Go!
Why are you such a fag?
Why are you such
a fucking dick?
That hat looks
good on you.
Thanks.
Keep it.
Thank you.
Never been on a bike?
Mmm-mmm.
Never.
You got to wear
one of these.
Okay.
You've got to hold on
tight right there.
Here we go. You ready?
I'm ready.
You sure?
Yeah.
Hey, babe, relax.
She'll be back when
she gets back.
Quit telling me
to relax. Okay?


                              Page 39/68

What the fuck?
Wow. Funny how someone
conveniently forgot to tell me
that they were driving home
on a motorcycle.
Do you know how many
people I've seen come
into the hospital paralyzed
from motorcycle accidents?
I'm a very safe driver, N ic.
Yeah, that is
so not the point that
I'm making, Paul.
Joni knows that
this is something
I'd just never allow.
Mom, I'm 18 years old.
Yeah?
I won't even be living
here in, like, a month.
Yeah, well, you're
living here now.
Yeah?
Well, why don't you
get a jump on it and
pretend like I'm not?
She's never talked
to me like that before.
You know, if you
backed off a little bit
on the restrictions,
you probably wouldn't
have so much conflict.
Oh, really?
You think so, Paul?
Is that how it works?
What's going on?
Oh, nothing. Nothing.
Paul's just giving me some
child-rearing lessons.
I'm just saying...
Listen, when you've been
a parent for 18 years,
you come and talk to me, okay?


                                 Page 40/68

I'm just making
an observation.
Yeah? Well, I need
your observations like
I need a dick in my ass!
Joni?
Honey. Look,
I was upset, okay?
You know how I feel
about motorcycles.
Yeah, I know how
you feel about them.
But I'm an adult now,
and you have to respect
that, okay?
Good night.
Good? Good?
Yeah, that's perfect.
Thanks.
Hey, Paul.
Hey, Jules.
What's up?
It's all right.
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about last night.
Hey...
I was really embarrassed.
Hey, it wasn't you.
It was her who wigged out.
I think she's, you know,
she's just having
a really hard time.
You know?
Yeah. You really don't
have to defend her.
Seriously.
And about that kiss, that's...
You know, I don't do that.
I completely
sensed that, yeah.
So...
I just wanted
to clear the air.
The air is cleared.


                                 Page 41/68

No, it's clear.
No, Paul, I can't!
Why? You don't want to?
No, I have a guy outside!
Oh, yeah.
Right, the guy.
Oh, God.
Okay, wait. Wait.
Well! Hello!
Yeah! Yeah!
Okay, not so hard.
Not so hard.
Okay.
What?
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah?
Come on.
- Excuse me?
You gotta be
fucking kidding me!
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Excuse me, seora?
I can't fucking believe it.
Okay.
You gotta go talk to him.
Are you gonna go talk to him?
Okay. Fuck.
Oh, God.
Shit.
- Excuse me, seora?
- Okay!
Hey, what's up?
Where do you
want the stones?
Stones?
Over by the fence.
What?
I was using the bathroom.
Do you need to use
the bathroom?
Okay, then.
I'll be right back.
Okay.
Take your time.


                                Page 42/68

That's H.
Yeah, I know.
All right. Lay-up.
All right.
Now you don't have
to go easy on me
because you're winning.
Nobody likes
a show-off, man.
You gotta go
behind the back.
God.
Can I ask you a question?
Would you rather
be buried or cremated?
That's your question?
I'd rather be cremated.
I think I'd...
I think I'd rather
be buried.
But why? I mean,
you're just gonna be
taking up more
space in the earth.
I don't know.
The idea of being,
you know,
torched into a chalky
white substance has got me
a little freaked out.
Why does it matter to you?
You're not even
gonna be conscious.
Okay, well, maybe,
I don't know,
I want a place
for people to come
and visit me one day.
But why?
You're gonna be dead.
You won't even
know they're there.
Okay. Take it easy.
Come on.


                             Page 43/68

So, what do you like better,
Nike or New Balance?
Nike.
Oh, God, here we go.
God, I love your
necklace! Can I see it?
Sure.
It's so beautiful.
Thank you.
Is it African?
Yes, it's Ethiopian.
Did you get it there?
No, I got it
at a flea market
in Brooklyn.
Is that where you're from?
No, I'm from here.
Cool.
Hey, guys, how you doing?
Good.
How's the food?
It's great.
Good? You're not
gonna eat your chicken?
It's so yummy.
It's good?
Yeah, it's really good.
I'm sorry, but I have
to take the lovely Tanya
away for a moment.
All right. It was lovely
talking to you, ladies.
You, too.
You, too.
Okay, I'm sorry, but
your donor daddy is
giving me the sex vibe.
No, he's not.
He wouldn't do that.
Why not?
He's not my dad.
God, Sasha,
that's totally gross!
Not everybody


                               Page 44/68

wants to have sex
with you, okay?
Especially when
you act like a slut.
Fuck you.
Well, it makes
you seem insecure
and desperate.
I'm not insecure
and desperate.
I'm just a normal,
sexual person.
Maybe you'd understand that
if you weren't so uptight.
Fuck you.
I'm not uptight.
Oh, my God,
these heirloom tomatoes
are amazing.
Oh, yeah,
they're in season.
You know, Joni brought
some home from Paul's
garden the other day.
They were huge.
So the kids have
been spending time
with him?
Yeah. Yeah, they're
spending all kinds of
quality time together.
Well, you're lucky.
You're lucky that the kids
bonded with the donor.
I mean, you hear so
many nightmare stories.
No, no, it's great.
They all just get
along famously.
Apparently, Paul
can do no wrong.
Excuse me. Could we get
another bottle of the
Seavey Cabernet?


                              Page 45/68

Thank you.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I don't need any more.
Yeah, you're alone
on this one, N icole.
Hey, so have you guys
gotten into the whole acai
smoothie craze?
Acai fruit packs.
Yeah. No, but they're
pushing them like crack
at Whole Foods.
Joel is so addicted to it.
He buys it by the case.
Here's what I do.
I throw one in the blender
with bananas, frozen
strawberries and hemp milk.
And I'll tell you what,
it is pretty sensational.
J ust fucking kill me.
Okay?
Honey.
I'm sorry, guys,
but I just can't with
the fucking hemp milk
and the organic farming.
And, you know, if I hear
one more person say that
they love heirloom tomatoes,
I'm gonna fucking
kill myself. Okay?
Oh. And do you know
that we're composting now?
Oh, yeah.
""No, don't throw that
in the trash.
""You have to put it
in the composting bin
""where all the beautiful
little worms will turn it
into this organic mulch,
""and then we'll all
feel good about


                               Page 46/68

ourselves."" You know?
I can't do it, okay?
I can't fucking do it.
Hey, babe. How about
some green tea?
You know what, J ules?
I like my wine, okay?
So fucking sue me.
And FYI, red wine
has a chemical called
resveratrol in it,
which has been proven
to significantly extend
human lifespan.
If you drink, like,
a thousand glasses a day,
yeah.
Fuck you.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
Go to her.
Whoa.
What the hell
is going on with them?
Oh, my God.
What is going on with you?
It's this whole Paul thing.
It's just driving me
crazy, all right?
I feel like
he's taking over
my family.
No. He's...
Can I get you anything?
No thanks, no.
He's not. He's not.
Okay.
Okay, I'm sorry,
all right?
I guess I'm just exhausted.
Yeah, maybe you just
need to take some
time off, recharge.
Right?


                              Page 47/68

Yeah, right.
Who's gonna pay
for that?
I mean, look,
I'm sorry,
but, you know, I feel
like I'm carrying
the whole load here.
Yeah, 'cause that's
the way you like it.
That's the way
you keep control.
What are you
talking about?
Come on,
you hated it
when I worked.
You wanted me at home
taking care of the kids.
You wanted a wife.
That is just not true.
No, you didn't like
any of the nannies,
and you sure didn't
back my career.
What are you talking about?
I just helped you start
another business.
Yeah, so you can feel
better about yourself.
No, Jules.
So you can feel better
about yourself.
Are you even attracted
to me anymore?
Would you
still like the wine?
No, thank you.
We'll just take the check
from inside, please.
Okay, no problem.
Oh, yeah. Pull my hair.
Okay. Oh, yeah.
Okay.


                              Page 48/68

Ow!
I really want a cigarette.
I haven't smoked
since Laser was born.
Do you smoke?
Do you have a cigarette?
Sometimes,
but I don't have any.
I could go run out
and get you some.
Yeah. Yeah, no, no.
No, don't go.
God.
Do you think
I'm some sad-sack,
middle-aged lesbian?
You know, I have been trying
to come up with a way to
describe you to my friends,
and now I finally have it.
Thank you so much.
Fuck you.
You want to get that?
No, no. I want
to get some of this.
Paul, it's Joni.
I just wanted to call you
and apologize for
my friend Sasha.
You know, when you put
your hands on her shoulders,
I think that
she thought that...
Hey, Joni. It's Paul.
Don't get that.
Listen, I'm really sorry
about Sasha the other night.
No, I didn't even...
No, no. No... Really,
I didn't even notice that.
I hope you didn't
feel uncomfortable.
No, not at all. I...
Not at all.


                               Page 49/68

Okay, sure.
Well, as long as...
Hold on, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.
No, just get off me.
I'm just gonna...
Give me one second.
Get off.
Jone?
Oh, is my mom there?
Your mom?
No, no. She split.
She went on
a Home Depot run.
Did you go to Home Depot?
Yeah. J ust got back.
That was fast.
Yeah, no lines.
What's that look
you're giving me?
What look?
The look that you're
giving me right now.
No. That's no look.
That's just my face.
Yeah,
I'm not gonna play
this game with you.
You know, you can
keep your judgments
to yourself.
No. I didn't give
no looks, seora.
I don't ask
why you blow your nose
all the time.
If you have a drug problem,
then that's your business.
No, I don't have
no drug problem.
I have allergies.
Then why are
you a gardener?
'Cause I love


                              Page 50/68

the flowers.
Man, this is
not gonna work.
You know, I'm gonna pay you
through the end of the day,
and then we're through. Okay?
Thank you very much.
Thanks. Thank you.
Can we talk about...
No, we can't.
- A little bit.
- You know why?
'Cause there's nothing
to talk about.
I think you know.
You know.
Look.
I know you've all
been enjoying
your time with Paul.
And I know that I haven't
been as open to him
as everybody else,
and that's caused some
friction between us.
But I'd like to try
and change that, okay?
So I was thinking
it might be nice if
we all had dinner at
his house sometime.
Now that way,
I could get to know him
a little bit better,
and I could see all
the good work that Mom's
been doing in the backyard.
What do you think? Yeah?
Sure.
- Yeah.
- Sure.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Great.


                                Page 51/68

It's not...
I'm not done yet.
You know,
I'm not, you know...
No. No, I know.
I haven't done all
the planting or anything.
But I wanna see
the process.
You know, like other colors,
other than green colors.
Well, that's okay.
I just wanna see
the process.
Great.
Hey.
- Need a hand?
- Sure.
Hold on.
Let me help you.
Ready? Okay.
Right here.
Yeah.
We can't be doing this.
I know. This is...
I'm married.
The kids.
Yeah, and I love Nic, so...
Hey.
I don't...
It was fun while it lasted.
Sorry.
I bought you
some cigarettes.
Jesus. What is
wrong with me?
I shouldn't have
fired Luis like that.
That was so wrong.
Yeah, I think you're
being hard on yourself.
You know, I mean,
things just get messed up
sometimes.


                               Page 52/68

No, no, that wasn't messy.
That was fucked up.
I am so fucked up.
I...
I think
I'm falling for you.
Oh, God, Paul.
Don't.
Tonight was
a really good night.
Yeah.
That one table had, like,
five bottles of wine.
It was crazy.
It was a big night.
You know,
Joni's really pretty.
I think she's got
some of your genes.
You think? I think
she looks more like
her mom, but thanks.
I appreciate that.
It was really cute
seeing you in Dad mode.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It made me want
to fuck you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You know, I've been
missing our sleepovers.
Yeah, we haven't
been doing that in
a while, have we?
Mmm-mmm.
You want to meet up later?
Tanya,
you're so sexy
and beautiful, but I...
I don't think
we should do
that anymore.


                             Page 53/68

You know,
what we have is
really fun and easy,
but I don't want to be that,
like, 50-year-old guy who's
just hanging out, you know?
I really do want
to have a family,
and I need to be doing that
with someone who's, like,
ready to go there with me.
Oh.
Okay.
Tanya.
Yeah? Fuck you.
It's locked.
Yeah, I mean,
obviously I have
more to do down here.
I gotta fill it in,
but this is the general idea.
No, it looks great.
Yeah?
It's so indigenous.
Really.
I am so proud of you.
Yeah, you like it?
Yeah?
I'm so proud.
I love you, honey.
I love you, too.
I'm so glad you like it.
It's incredible.
Oh, man.
And now, wait,
how's that guy Luis
working out?
Man, I had to fire him.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, he has
a drug problem.
You're kidding!
What drug?
No. I know... I...


                                Page 54/68

Blow, I think.
You're a natural, kid.
- I know.
- Good.
You're a natural.
You can never have
too much olive oil.
Big no-no.
Oh! I forgot.
N ic, I got a bitching 1998
Alma Rosa that I think
you're just gonna love.
You know what? I think
I'm gonna stick with water,
but thank you so much.
You sure?
Yeah.
Jules.
Paul, this steak
is delicious.
Thank you.
Really, it's...
What is the seasoning?
Guys, we just misted it
with a little truffle oil,
right?
Mmm-hmm.
- It's so easy.
- Wow.
What a good idea.
We ought to try that.
Right, honey?
Mmm-hmm.
And it's done
to perfection.
Yeah?
It's not too rare?
Oh, no, no.
It's juicy and tender.
Exactly what rare's
supposed to be.
Right? I mean, I got people
coming into the restaurant,
they see the slightest


                              Page 55/68

bit of red, they just
start freaking out.
Isn't that annoying?
That happens to me
all the time
when I'm grilling.
Hey, red is rare.
Hello, it's bloody.
I mean...
Hello?
Yoo-hoo.
Hello, thank you.
Yeah, I mean,
if you're in Argentina,
and you ask for rare,
they bring you a cow
still mooing on the plate.
I really want to go
to Argentina. Buenos Aires
is supposed to be...
Hey. I noticed
your record collection
over there.
Wow, it's quite an
eclectic mix, you know.
Thank you very much, N ic.
You're welcome.
You don't meet
too many straight guys
who love Joni Mitchell.
You sure don't.
You like Joni?
No, not really.
We just named our
daughter after her.
Really?
Oh, shut the front door.
Come on. Really?
You never told me you
were named after Joni M.
It's so dorky.
I don't like to
bring it up.
That is so cool.


                             Page 56/68

No, what's your
favorite Joni album?
It's not cool.
Blue.
Right? My brother
from another mother.
Oh, my God.
I mean...
Listen, I spent half
of high school in my room
crying to that album.
That record,
it kills me.
It doesn't stop.
No.
River. California.
A Case Of You.
All I Want.
- Oh, God.
- Right?
I am on a lonely road
And I am traveling,
traveling, traveling
Looking for something
What can it be
I hate you some,
I hate you some
I love you some
I love you
When I forget about me
I want to talk to you
I want to shampoo you
I want to renew you
again and again
Applause, applause
Life is our cause
When I think of your kisses
My mind see-saws
Do you see,
do you see
Do you see, do you see
Do you see how
you hurt me, baby
And I hurt you, too


                              Page 57/68

That's why we both get
so blue
Bravo.
Don't quit your
day job, Mom.
Hey. It's already
hard enough to open your
heart in this world.
Don't make it any harder.
You're right. I'm sorry.
It was a wonderful rendition.
Beautiful, thank you.
I like this guy.
Why, thank you, N ic.
Okay. Paul,
where's your bathroom?
It's just right here
around the corner.
All right. Thanks.
And you know what?
I am gonna have a glass
of the Alma Rosa, okay?
All right.
So, I think you'd
really love Argentina.
I really
wanna go there.
Buenos Aires
is literally, like,
one of the most beautiful
cities in the world.
I was in a rainstorm
in the Grand Canyon.
- Can we go?
- I'll take you.
A big rattlesnake
when I was in the desert
in Baja, Mexico.
We should.
I'll take you to Baja.
I was in the desert and...
What's it like there?
It's beautiful.
I was surfing, but then


                                Page 58/68

there was no waves,
so we climbed up
into the mountains.
And I hear a rattling,
and it was a rattlesnake.
And so I was scrambling.
I didn't know what to do,
so I reached out for
a rock, and then I threw it
at the rattlesnake...
Did you guys spend
some time up there?
Yeah, a long time ago.
Yeah. Yeah.
Beautiful, beautiful beaches.
You'd like it.
It's really nice
having you guys over.
I don't entertain here
very much.
Cheers.
- All right.
- All right.
To an unconventional family.
You and Paul
were getting along
like gang-busters.
You're sleeping
with him, aren't you?
What?
J ust be honest
with me, okay?
Don't make me feel crazier
than I feel right now.
Where is this coming from?
I don't...
Well, I found your hair
in his drain.
Because...
Because I was working,
and I got dirty,
and I took a shower.
Yeah?
Did you take a nap, too?


                                Page 59/68

Are you in love with him?
No.
Are you straight now?
No. It has nothing
to do with that!
I've just felt so far away
from you lately.
Oh, right.
So it's my fault?
No! Who said
anything about fault?
Just listen to me!
I'm listening!
What?
I just... I just...
I needed...
What? To be fucked?
No. Appreciated.
Well, it's always what
I'm not doing for you,
isn't it?
Well, okay.
Here's what
I don't do to you.
I don't work out my issues
by fucking other people!
He's not just ""other people.""
No! He's our sperm donor.
You couldn't have picked
a more painful way to hurt me.
Where are you going?
I need water!
Oh!
Shit!
Shit.
Joni.
I don't want
to talk to you.
Can we just talk
about what happened?
I said I don't
want to talk to you.
Okay. I understand.
Laser? Honey?


                                 Page 60/68

What?
I know that
you and Joni heard
what was going on,
and I wanted to tell you
that what happened
with me and Paul is over.
There's nothing
going on now.
Okay.
I know it'll probably take
you a while to process
your feelings around this,
but I just wanted to tell you
that I'm here if you ever
want to talk about anything.
Is there anything
you want to talk about?
Not really.
How's Nic?
She's a mess.
They're not talking.
I've never seen her
like that.
Is it him?
Hello?
Hey, darling.
How you doing?
You're such a phony.
Excuse me?
You act like you're
so groovy and together,
but you're not.
You're a shitty person!
Oh, no.
What happened?
With my mom?
Listen, you gotta let me
just come and talk to you,
honey, please.
What's wrong with you?
Joni, listen to me. Please...
Don't call me again.
Hey, Paul,


                                Page 61/68

look at these cukes.
Aren't they awesome?
No.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Hello?
I just talked to Joni.
What happened?
What's going on?
N ic found my hair
in your bathroom.
Fuck.
I n the drain.
The other night?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Hey, you know what?
I just say we go for it.
I mean, it's all out
in the open now.
I mean,
let's just do this thing.
Paul...
I don't care what you say,
Jules. We can...
This can work, you know.
This isn't a mistake.
Paul.
This isn't just happening
for no reason.
Let's get
the kids together.
Paul, come on.
I'm sick of this life.
Let's make this happen.
I'm ready.
I'm gay.
Fuck it. I wanna...
Jesus.
Hello?
Hey, hey.
Slow down, tiger.
You don't wanna get sick.
I'm fine.


                             Page 62/68

Are you gonna
talk to him?
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
I like the scruff.
It's sexy.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
We're in the middle
of a conversation.
That's okay.
Can I talk to you?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Green chilies, queso sauce,
blue corn tortillas.
This is a poblano pepper.
So, what's up?
Are you okay?
Fine.
I just wanted
to get another pillow.
The couch is really saggy.
Your back hurts?
Yeah. It's super achy.
Well, you should
take some Advil.
Hey, how was the party?
Fine.
Were there a lot
of people there?
I don't know.
Are you drunk, honey?
No.
Hey, did you drive
yourself home?
Yeah. What's the big deal?
I'm not drunk.
You seem drunk to me.
Yeah, well,
you should know.
What did you say to me?
- Nothing. I'm going to bed.


                               Page 63/68

- Hey, honey. I...
What do you want from me?
I did everything you wanted!
I got all A's!
I got into every
school I applied!
Now you can show everyone
what a perfect lesbian
family you have!
Don't talk to your
mom like that!
You're really gonna
tell me how to act?
Now?
You know what?
I am still your mother,
and you...
Don't touch me!
I'm so sick of
both of you!
Hey, did you remember
to pack the lamp I gave you?
Mmm-hmm.
Well, we can always
get stuff there,
you know.
I mean, if your room's
too dark, or you need
extra bedding or...
I'm not going
to Siberia, Mom.
I can't believe
it's your last dinner
at home.
Are you seriously
about to cry?
I wish you were gay.
You'd be much
more sensitive.
That's probably Sasha.
I'll get it.
How long
a drive is it?
About eight


                               Page 64/68

hours, I think.
What are you doing here?
I just needed to talk to you
before you left. Please.
There's nothing
to talk about.
I wanted to apologize again.
I can't tell you
how ashamed,
how much I regret
what happened.
So, like, everything that
happened between us,
what was that?
That was just bullshit?
No, no.
It wasn't bullshit at all.
Okay?
I know that I don't
have much credibility
right now,
but I really, really
care about you.
And I wanna know that
I'm gonna be able to see
you again someday.
I mean, I...
Do you think that
could ever happen?
I don't know.
I just wish that
you could've been...
What?
Better.
Oh.
You have got
some balls, mister.
Hold on, N ic.
No, no, no.
You hold on.
You know what
you did to my kids?
Shit.
Let me tell you something,


                               Page 65/68

man, this is not your family.
This is my family!
I know that, Nic.
No, you don't know.
You don't know,
and you know why?
Because you're
a fucking interloper.
If you want a family so much,
you go out and make your own!
I need to say something.
It's no big secret
your mom and I are
in hell right now, and...
Bottom line is,
marriage is hard.
It's really fucking hard.
Just two people
slogging through the shit,
year after year,
getting older, changing.
It's a fucking
marathon, okay?
So, sometimes, you know,
you're together so long,
that you just...
You stop seeing
the other person.
You just see
weird projections
of your own junk.
Instead of talking
to each other,
you go off the rails
and act grubby
and make stupid choices,
which is what I did.
And I feel sick about it
because I love you guys,
and I love your mom,
and that's the truth.
Sometimes you hurt
the ones you love the most.
I don't know why.


                                Page 66/68

You know, if I read more
Russian novels, then...
Anyway...
I just wanted to say
how sorry I am
for what I did.
I hope you'll
forgive me eventually.
Thank you.
Oh!
N ice, huh?
This is big.
It's bigger than
I thought it would be.
Okay.
Did you remember the lamp?
Thank God.
Here it is. Here.
Honey, where
do you want this?
Do you want it on your desk?
Do you want it next
to the bed?
Guys, I've got it.
I think the sheets
are in here.
Mom.
Guys, I can do it, okay?
No, no, I can do it.
Mom.
Is that...
Mom, I got it.
I can do it.
Thanks.
Can I just have a minute,
please? Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Great.
Hey.
Where'd you guys go?
We had to move the car.


                               Page 67/68

I thought you left.
We wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.
Give us some credit.
It's gonna be weird
not having you
around anymore.
Sorry to leave you
alone with them.
It'll be okay.
Hey, guys, come on.
Hey, it's okay.
I'll speak to you
soon, okay?
Okay.
I don't think you guys
should break up.
No? Why's that?
I think you're too old.
Thanks, Laser.

Tin Cup

1.
TINNY CHEATIN' HEART MUSIC, the dull GROAN of a TRACTOR,
CRICKETS CHIRPIN' love songs, sporadic ZAPS from BUGLIGHTS, and an
occasional random THWOCK as we -FADE

IN:
1 EXT. TEXAS - DRAMATIC ANGLE - SUNSET 1
Out west where the sun descends gloriously over desolatemountains. A sense
of timeless and incorruptible beautyif you ignore the TWANG of the MUSIC,
the SPUTTER of theTRACTOR, the ZAPS, the THWACKS... and something else...
... MEN'S VOICES. Garrulous with drink, fraternity and
amusement.

We PAN DOWN TO:
2 EXT. DRIVING RANGE - LATE DAY 2
A man, JOSE, is on the roof, wrestling with a ricketysatellite dish,
stringing wire, trying to get it to work.
(We get glimpses of him throughout the scene as hestruggles with what is
assuredly a pirate operation.)
Four of six floodlights nailed to the roof cast pools ofyellow into the
gathering darkness. ROY ""TIN CUP"" McAVOY
stands under the swarm of moths crowding the brightestlight, hitting golf
balls. THWOCK...! Launching them,
really, into the deepening night. There's a beer between
his legs. Behind him:
A group of men forms a semicircle, facing away from TinCup. These men are
the range regulars: CURT, CLINT,
EARL, and DEWEY. Each man has money in one hand and hispreferred libation
in the other. They're all lookingback and forth between the bug lights hung
on the backwall, and muttering what sounds like bets to:
ROMEO POSAR -- a smaller man, he stands at the center of
the group with a handful of cash. Romeo is a part-timebookie and full-time
driving range man. Born across the
river in Mexico, Romeo is Tin Cup's caddie, confidante,
best friend.

ROMEO :
Okay, all bets are down!
Their eyes rivet on the bug lights, edgy, hopeful,
until... ZAP! A BUG is ELECTROCUTED. And Dewey cheerstriumphantly while the
other regulars mutter curses abouthow they woulda, coulda, shoulda bet.

ROMEO :


                                 Page 2/150

Number one is the winner! Dewey
has the winner. Pays five to two!
Romeo quickly pays Dewey and more quickly takes money from
the losers. It's fast-paced, inane, time-killing
gambling. Tin Cup looks over.

TIN CUP :
Don't you shitheels ever get
bored?
The regulars flap dismissive palms and mutter in the
negative as they turn back to Romeo and the action at the
bug lights.

TIN CUP :
... 'Cuz I got a riddle.
Tin Cup leads the regulars inside.

CUT TO:
A3 INT. DRIVING RANGE - LATE DAY A3
Tin Cup holds court.

TIN CUP :
Takes about two ounces of brains
to figure it out. Anyone think
they got a brain with two ounces
of brains in it?
The regulars silently look at each other, reluctant to
reveal the heft of their brains.

TIN CUP :
For Chrissakes, boys! A little
self-confidence from the players'
gallery. We ain't talking long
division.

EARL :
(timidly)
How much we gotta lose?

TIN CUP :
You want to liven things up, Earl?
That's a hell of an idea. Say
everyone puts in twenty bucks and
the pot goes to whoever solves the


                                    Page 3/150

riddle.

DEWEY :
You going to get the riddle, Tin
Cup?
3.

TIN CUP:
(patiently)
Dewey. I'm the one asking the
riddle. I already know the
answer. I don't getta guess.
Although... We could say if I get
to five hundred bounces and no one
gets the riddle, I get the pot.
And I know what you're thinking.
It's an impossible riddle. Well,
It's not. It's an easy riddle.
And if somehow by the grace of
fluke luck I win, and you all
don't agree it was an easy
riddle, hell, I'll refund your
money.
EARL, CLINT & ALL
I'm in... We're in... Count us
in... etc...

TIN CUP:
Okay, a man's driving down the
road with his son and they get
in a crash. Two ambulances come
and take the man and his son to
different hospitals. Son goes
into the operating room, the
doctor looks at him and says, 'I
can't operate on this boy. He's
my son.' How's that possible?
(beat)
The clock's ticking boys...
Tin Cup begins bouncing a ball on the face of his wedge.

EARL:
Father didn't sneak back in,
right? He's still at the other


                                   Page 4/150

hospital?

TIN CUP:
It ain't 'Star Trek,' Earl. No
one beamed him aboard.
That eliminates the most plausible theory in their minds.
The men think harder.

EARL:
Well... if the father married the
son's daughter -

TIN CUP:
It's a family riddle, Earl. Think
clean thoughts.
4.
The regulars puzzle some more.

CLINT :
Give us a little hint.
MOLLY (O.S.)
The doctor's a woman.
All heads turn to take in the arrival of:
3 MOLLY GRISWOLD 3
Standing just inside the door -- she's a fresh-faced
beauty in her early thirties, and she's got all new
everything the sport of golf requires: new bag, new
clubs, new shoes, new clothes, new visor... she looks
like she stepped out of an ad in Golf Digest. And all
the men are asking themselves the same question: what's
she doing here? The silence invites Molly to supply the
riddle's answer.

MOLLY:
The doctor is the son's mother.
Feminists pose the riddle to
reveal how deeply our sexual
stereotypes run.
(directly to Tin Cup)
I take it you're a feminist?
Tin Cup misses the ball he's been bouncing, breaking the
spell. The regulars wait for Tin Cup's response.

TIN CUP:


                                    Page 5/150

Ma'am, I've been called a lot of
things -- but no one's ever
saddled me with that one.

MOLLY:
You might try being saddled
sometime -- the smell of leather,
the sting of a whip...
The regulars snicker, enjoying her one-upmanship.

TIN CUP :
(slightly taken
aback)
I'm just a humble golf pro...

MOLLY:
You're Roy McAvoy the golf pro? I
pictured something... different.
I have a seven o'clock lesson.

TIN CUP :
I thought I had a Doctor Griswold
5.
at seven.
They hurry out to the range, Tin Cup oblivious to hisgaffe.
And the regulars gather to look out the window -4
THEIR POV - THROUGH WINDOW 4
To the range, where Molly is stretching and Tin Cup isdiscreetly waving to
the regulars to get lost.

CUT TO:
5 EXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT 5
The lesson begins. Tin Cup can be slightly condescendingin these
situations, though she's got him a little wary.

TIN CUP :
The first thing you gotta learnabout this game, Doc, is it ain'tabout
hitting a little white ballinto some yonder hole. It's about
inner demons and self-doubt and
human frailty and overcoming allthat crap. So... what kinda
doctor'd you say you were?

MOLLY :
I'm a psychologist -- in layman'sterms call me a neo-Jungian, post-


                                    Page 6/150

modern Freudian, holistic
secularist.
Damn.

TIN CUP :
She begins unpacking one of her bags, pulling out everygolf gimmick on the
market -- swing aid straps to pullyour elbows together, a ball pendulum
that hangs fromyour hat, a metal contraption for your feet, etc.

MOLLY :
Inner demons and human frailty aremy life's work. I used to
practice in El Paso but I've movedhere now...

TIN CUP :
What're those?

MOLLY :
I ordered these from the Golf
Channel.
6.
He stares in disbelief as she tries to wriggle into some
of this stuff. He's enchanted and dismayed.

TIN CUP :
That stuff's a waste of money.

MOLLY :
I'm sure there are excesses and
repetitions here, but I believe in
the gathering of knowledge and I
figured, well, there must be some
truths about the golf swing
illustrated by these devices -and
that you'd help me sort
through it.
She stands there with contraptions coming from every
limb.

MOLLY :
I have dozens of golf videotapes,
too... And a golf watch.

TIN CUP:
(irritated, impatient)


                                    Page 7/150

Take it off. All of it. Now!
You're a smart woman, for
Chrissakes -- don't you know the
work of charlatans when you see
it?
She deposits all the golf gimmick devices in a pile.

MOLLY :
No. I can always tell when
someone is lying to himself, but
I'm quite susceptible and
frequently wrong when that person
lies to me.
(pointing to the
pile of devices)
That stuff cost me over 200
dollars -

TIN CUP :
Then it's 200 dollars of shit...
He tees a ball, hands Molly her driver and steps back.

TIN CUP :
Go ahead. Take a swing.
Molly takes a pitty-pat swing and whiffs, and mutters
under her breath with the ease of a longshoreman.
7.

MOLLY :
Aw, fuck...

TIN CUP :
Well, you talk like a golfer -
Molly unloads a mighty second swing. The club head
bounces off the mat. The ball sits untouched.

MOLLY :
Shit.

TIN CUP :
'Fuck...' 'Shit...' these are
highly technical golf terms and
you're using them on your first
lesson -- this is promising.


                                    Page 8/150

MOLLY :
Awright, wise ass, show me.
Tin Cup takes the club from Molly, motions for her to
step back, tees up a ball, and rockets a drive into the
night.

TIN CUP :
Something like that.
He hands her back the club and tees up another ball.
Molly just looks at him.

MOLLY :
Impressive. Y'know, I tend to
process things verbally. Can you
break down into words how you did
that?
Tin Cup takes a deep breath -- this is his speech.

TIN CUP :
'What is the golf swing?' -- by
Roy McAvoy.
(beat)
The golf swing is a poem.
TIN CUP (CONT'D)
Sometimes a love sonnet and
sometimes a Homerian epic -- it is
organic and of a piece, yet it
breaks down into elegant stanzas
and quatrains. The critical
opening phrase of this song is the
grip, in which the hands unite to
form a single unit by the simple
overlap of the smallest finger...
(displays grip)
... held lightly, a conductor's
8.
baton.
(starts swing)
Lowly and slowly the clubhead is
pulled back, led into position
not by the hands but the body
which turns away from the target,
shifting to the right side without


                                 Page 9/150

shifting balance. Tempo is
everything, perfection unobtainable,
as the body coils, now to the top
of the swing, in profound equilibrium.
And then a slight hesitation, a nod
to the gods...

MOLLY :
A nod to the gods?

TIN CUP :
To the gods, yes... that he is
fallible. As the weight shifts
back to the left pulled now by
powers inside the earth -- it's
alive, this swing, a living
sculpture -- and down through
contact, always down, into terra
firma, striking the ball crisply
-- with character -- a tuning
fork goes off in your heart, your
balls -- such a pure feeling is
the well-struck golf shot -- And
then the follow through to finish,
always on line -- The reverse 'C'
of the Golden Bear, the steelworker's
power and brawn of Carl Sandburg's
Arnold Palmer, the da Vinci of
Hogan, the unfinished symphony of
Roy McAvoy.

MOLLY :
What? What's unfinished?

TIN CUP :
I have a short follow through -my
swing can look unfinished.

MOLLY :
Why?

TIN CUP :
Some say it's because that's the
best way to play through the winds


                                    Page 10/150

of West Texas... and some say it's
because I never finish anything.
You can decide. The point is every
finishing position is unique as if
that is the signature left to the
artist, the warrior athlete who,
9.
finally and thereby, has asserted
his oneness with and power over the
universe by willing a golf ball to
go where he wants and how and when,
because that is what the golf swing
is about...
(finally)
It is about gaining control of
your life, and letting go at the
same time.
Molly stares back, exhausted and intrigued.

MOLLY :
Jeez Louise...

TIN CUP:
There is only one other acceptable
theory of how to hit a golf ball.

MOLLY:
I'm afraid to ask. What's the
other theory?

TIN CUP :
Grip it and rip it.

MOLLY:
While I appreciate your poetic
sensibility, Mr. McAvoy -

TIN CUP :
Call me Roy, Molly...

MOLLY :
Call me Dr. Griswold...
MOLLY (CONT'D)
Roy... but at this point I think


                                   Page 11/150

I'm more of the 'grip it and rip
it' school. Hand me the driver.
Tin Cup does. She tees it up.

TIN CUP:
Waggle it, Doc, don't forget to
waggle.
(as she stares at
him)
Waggle... the club head...
(shows her)
... it's a little relaxing
ritual...
She waggles the club head, then takes the club back.
10.

TIN CUP :
Let the Big Dog eat!
She stops, lets the club fall.

MOLLY :
What Big Dog?

TIN CUP :
The driver, the number one wood -

MOLLY :
It's metal.

TIN CUP :
Yeah, woods are metal -- don't
worry about it -- and the driver's
known as the Big Dog and I'm just
saying to turn him loose, let 'er
rip, let the Big Dog eat!

MOLLY :
Oh.
She swings. Tops the ball. It goes ten feet.

MOLLY :
This is, without a doubt, the
stupidest, silliest, most idiotic
grotesquery masquerading as a game


                                    Page 12/150

that has ever been invented.

TIN CUP :
(cheerfully)
Yes, ma'am, that's why I love it.
(beat)
And if you hit one good shot -- if
that tuning fork rings in your
loin -- you can't wait to get
back.
She cracks one dead solid perfect out into the night. It
felt great and she knows it.

MOLLY :
I think the Big Dog ate something.

TIN CUP :
Did the tuning fork ring in your
loin?

MOLLY :
I wouldn't go that far.

TIN CUP :
Always quit on a good shot. We'll
call that lesson number one...
11.
(confidentially)
... and if ya wouldn't mind paying
me in cash -- there's a little
I.R.S. situation I'm dealing with

MOLLY :
If you're such a legendary striker
of the golf ball as everyone says,
then why are you, at your age, out
here in the middle of nowhere
operating a barely solvent
establishment, ducking the I.R.S.,
collecting a few pathetic dollars
to buy your next sixpack -- when
you're capable of so much more?
Her speech is delivered without judgement or rancor, so
matter of factly that he's disarmed.


                                   Page 13/150

TIN CUP :
Perhaps I'm chocked full of inner
demons?

MOLLY :
No, you're chocked full of
bullshit -
(cheerily)
Same time next week?
She heads off to the parking lot. He stares.

TIN CUP :
What did you mean I should try
'being saddled' sometime?
TIN CUP (CONT'D)
Were you being literal or was that
some kind of Freudian type deal?
Molly? Doctor?
(beat)
What kind of saddle?

CLOSE ON MOLLY:
As she walks into the West Texas night. She smiles,
enjoying Tin Cup's confusion.
Tin Cup just stares into the night, holding his cash, until
JOSE'S VOICE ECHOES down from the roof.

JOSE :
I got it! Esta bien! The flag
is up!

CUT TO:

7 INT. DRIVING RANGE SHACK - NIGHT 7
Tin Cup enters, cash in hand, as the regulars all gather
excitedly around the TV monitor now coming in.

TIN CUP :
A class act there, boys -probably
the first actual `lady
type' female ever seen on these
premises -




                                    Page 14/150

ROMEO :
Shut up, boss -- we got the Corpus
Christi dog track on the dish -

EARL :
This is yer dead mortal cinch lock
bet with Do-reen.
Everyone's glued to the set. A greyhound race comes on
from a remote Texas track on the gulf.

TIN CUP :
Free money, boys, what does
Doreen know about the fine art of
Greyhound breeding?

ROMEO :
All she knows is she likes the
three dog 'cause his name is
Pride of Odessa 'cause she's
from Odessa.

TIN CUP :
Get ready for Oddessa-lation, boys.
How deep we in?

ROMEO :
You gave her twenty to one -

EARL :
It's only fifteen to one on the
toteboard -

TIN CUP :
Yeah, but I got every other dog
in the race. I'm just getting
even with Doreen -- I'm not
trying to clean her clock.

CLINT :
So how much you stand to lose?

ROMEO :
Twelve thousand.
13.


                                    Page 15/150

TIN CUP :
Hundred.

ROMEO :
Thousand.

TIN CUP :
(panicky)
Hundred.

ROMEO :
You said to shoot the wad.

TIN CUP :
I said get even, Pod. I didn't
say shoot the wad. We better see
that three dog rolling on his ass.
All eyes on the monitor -- the dogs break.

EARL :
Except... if he breaks slow, he
won't get creamed...
The starting box opens -- ""THERE GOES THE RABBIT"" -- the
three dog breaks slow and trails down the front stretch.

REGULARS :
Three dog's dying, T.C.... easy
money... (etc.)
The one dog veers wide, going into the escape turn,
annihilating the field. Dogs fly ass over teakettle
like bowling pins, and -

REGULARS :
Uh-oh.
The three dog clears the pileup, untouched, hugging the
rail. It has a ten length lead as it moves down the
backstretch and past the toteboard. The race is over -the
three dog wins.
Deathly silence. Somebody flips OFF the TV. Finally,
in a lame attempt to lighten the moment, Romeo speaks -

ROMEO :
So, Roy, you were saying you


                                 Page 16/150

felt a little flutter for this
doctor lady?

TIN CUP :
Yes, I was saying that... just
before I was interrupted by...
bankruptcy -- a development that
the 'Doctor Lady,' as you call her,
14.
will consider utterly predictable.

CUT TO:

Romeo doesn't realize the truth in his own response.

ROMEO :
It's a bad habit I picked upfrom knowing you so long.

TIN CUP :
Busy man, Courtenay, busy man -
As they pass the stage, even the Naked Dancer interrupts
her moment with a bunch of guys offering dollar bills -

NAKED DANCER :
Tin Cup! Hi, sweetie!

TIN CUP :
Hiya, honey -- lookin' sweet...
And backstage they go, easily waved through by another
bouncer. They come up to a dressing room door. And
knock.
A voice from inside.
VOICE (O.S.)
That better be you, Roy.
10 TIN CUP AND ROMEO 10
enter this holy of holies with complete familiarity. And
there she is -- DOREEN, 35, at least, the classic chesty,
hippie, big-wigged Texas goddess. She's older than the
other girls, and more experienced in every way. She's
smoking a cigarette and finishing up the touches on her
stripper's outfit.
Tin Cup and Romeo stand at her beckoning.

TIN CUP :
Doreen...

ROMEO:
You're looking particularly
lovely this evening -- This is
nicer than the leopard suit -

DOREEN:
Cut the horseshit, guys. So...
the one and two dogs always run

wide and the three dog always
breaks slow, so I figure there's
gonna be a big ol' pile of fur at
the turn and the three dog's
gonna tiptoe around it and walk
on home... I was right.
(smiles)
You owe me twelve thousand
dollars.

ROMEO :
We going to pay you.
16.
Tin Cup squirms as Doreen babbles a bit.

DOREEN :
I know you're going to pay me.
DOREEN (CONT'D)
(admiring her own
outfit)
Y'know I finally got rid of the
leopard suit thing -- it was so
retro, y'know... it's not easy
being a post-modern stripper...
(beat)
So... twelve big ones?
Tin Cup finally digs into his coat pocket and produces
some official-looking papers. He hands them to her.

TIN CUP :
There. With equity and inventory
it's worth twelve grand... more or
less.
Doreen leans forward to examine the papers. She looks at
Tin Cup with surprise.

DOREEN :
This is how you think you can
settle up? By deeding me your
driving range?

TIN CUP :
Only on condition you don't sell
right away, and me'n Romeo keep


                                    Page 19/150

our jobs.

DOREEN :
What in the world would I want
with your stupid driving range?

TIN CUP :
Equity, inventory, cash flow...
not to mention an enhanced stature
in the community, and prepaid
membership in the Salome Chamber
of Commerce.
For a moment, Doreen can only stare dumbly at Tin Cup,
caught off guard by this unexpected turn of fortune. Then
she starts to consider the idea more seriously.

DOREEN :
What are your labor costs?
(off no response
from Tin Cup)
Payroll, Roy. What do you pay
17.
your help?

TIN CUP :
Let's see... the tractor kid getsfive bucks an hour. Romeo, he
gets ten cash -DOREEN
What do you pay yourself?
Myself?

TIN CUP :
Doreen nods in a way Tin Cup finds threatening.

DOREEN :
To hit golf balls all day... whenyou're not breaking for beers orcorn dogs
or to gather the guysand lay bets on which crow fliesoff the fence next.

TIN CUP :
You're referring to my managerialsalary?

DOREEN :
I'm referring to every nickel yousnatch out of the till and everybag of
beer nuts you lift from therack, is what I'm referring to.

SIMMS:

Well, you tell him I'm in town for

tournament, and I got a spot for

ROMEO :
You got a spot for Tin Cup? I
thought you hated him.

SIMMS :
Romeo! You wound me. I'm fond
of the guy, going way back to our
days at University of Houston,
when we won all those titles
together.

ROMEO :
He says he carried you on his
back.
Simms won't be drawn into this adolescent competition -he's
too comfortable with himself and his success.

SIMMS :
I didn't have much craft back

ability. Roy's a great ball-
striker....

ROMEO :
Why you here?

SIMMS :
I want to win my own tournament,
and he can help me if we can
manage to behave like grownups
together. Tell him that.
Tin Cup suddenly appears in the doorway.

TIN CUP :
What's the catch?

SIMMS :
There is no catch. I put together
a tournament with an elite field
and a half-million dollar purse,
and I'm tired of seeing all the
money head out of town.

TIN CUP :
Then make more birdies.
20.

SIMMS :
I need you on my team.

TIN CUP :
You ain't that friendly a guy...

fairway, every subtle break on

SIMMS :
Me an' you -- like the old days.
Tin Cup can't quite believe this offer from his old
nemesis but there aren't many options out there. He
grabs Simms's hand and starts pumping it, gushing
with enthusiasm.

TIN CUP :
... Well, put 'er there, partner!
These two homeboys are gonna show
the world what golf in West Texas
is all about!

SIMMS :
No, Roy. I didn't mean I want you
to play with me. I just want you
to caddie for me, read my putts,
club me, that kinda stuff.
Tin Cup wilts like a time-lapsing daisy. His hand falls
free of Simms's. Words fail him.

ROMEO :
You son of a bitch.

TIN CUP :
(to himself, blankly)
Caddie? Me?

SIMMS :
I can't bring a guy in off the
street to play in my tournament.
It's a big-time event, corporate
sponsors, thirty dollar tickets...
I got a network to cover -

This guy off the street, he could
kick your ass on that golf course.
Like he kicked your ass in junior
golf. Like he kicked your ass in
college. Like -

SIMMS :
I'll pay you a hundred for the
loop, five percent of any
earnings -

ROMEO :
Get the hell outta here! Take
your goddamn color coordinated
corporate sponsored soul and get
outta here.

SIMMS :
Okay, okay, just thought I'd offer
you some work...
Simms heads to his car.

Simms!

SIMMS :
(stops)
What?

TIN CUP :
I'll take the job.

ROMEO :
We'll take the job.
Simms nods in agreement, and exits. Tin Cup stands there
with Romeo, feeling humiliated.
POV SHOT - SIMMS
drives away down the road.
TIN CUP (O.S.)
That man stands for everything I
hate in life.
ROMEO (O.S.)
You mean like... success?

A leader board reads: SIMMS/STADLER -10, MICKELSON/
MCCORD -8.
A giant gallery lines the fairway and rings the distant
green which is fronted by a lake, as:
STADLER hits a three wood toward the green -- the BALL
PLUNKS in the middle of the lake. The GALLERY GROANS.
Stadler just shrugs to Simms, as if to say, ""I thought I
had enough club.""

SIMMS:
Like I told you, it was more'n
you had in the bag.

STADLER:
Yeah, well... I had to go for it
after your caddy said he could
get home from here.
Simms swivels his head around to look at Tin Cup.

TIN CUP :
I could.
Simms looks away, at the shot he's facing: a two hundred
fifteen yard carry over water. He looks back at Tin Cup,
shaking his head.

SIMMS:
I gotta hand it to you, Roy. For
fifteen holes you've seemed to
grasp the concept here: I'm
trying to win and your job is to
help me.

TIN CUP :
Five percent of your earnings does
numb the gag reflex.

SIMMS :
Give me the seven iron. I'm
laying up.

TIN CUP :
You can make that shot.

SIMMS :
The smart play's to lay up.

TIN CUP :
These fans didn't pay thirty bucks
to watch a tour star lay up on a
short par five.

SIMMS :
I'm sitting on a two shot lead
with three to go, and my partner's
in his pocket. Suddenly, par's a
good number. Gimme the seven
Iron.

TIN CUP :
No way. You're going for the
green. These fans paid good money
to see golf shots they can't hit,
not golf shots they feel shitty
about themselves for having to
hit.
Simms reaches for the seven iron. Tin Cup clamps a hand
over the club.

TIN CUP :
Thirteen years on tour and you're
still a pussy. Hit the fucking
one iron, Dave.

SIMMS :


                                    Page 27/150

Thirteen years in a driving range
and you still think this game's
about your testosterone count.
Simms removes Tin Cup's hand from the seven iron and
grabs the club, stepping up to address the ball. Tin Cup
mutters to the gallery.

TIN CUP :
Two-fifteen to carry, and the tour
star's laying up.
And the remark summons gallery voices suddenly urging
Simms to go for the green. Simms motions for Tin Cup, as

SIMMS :
But if you're gonna editorialize,
do it on the other side of the
ropes. I got no qualms about
firing your ass right here, right
now.

TIN CUP :
Fire me? Hell, I should fire you.
Simms steps back to his ball with the seven iron, and:

Stadler's still standing back where he hit the shot into 16
the lake. MICKELSON and GARY McCORD, the other team in
the pairing, are there with him. Romeo, Stadler's caddie,
stands just behind them.
McCORD
(to Mickelson)
I know you could knock it on from
here, I'm just saying that caddie's
been drinking muddy water if he
thinks he can.

ROMEO :
He can.
All the players look at Romeo as:
Simms dumps his seven iron shot safely down in front of
the water to a smattering of polite applause.
Simms tosses the club back to his bag as Tin Cup
retrieves the divot. And:


                                    Page 28/150

STADLER :
Hey, Dave! We in a hurry?
Simms looks several yards back where Stadler is still
standing with McCord and Mickelson.

STADLER :
'Cause I just bet McCord and
Mickelson that your caddie could
knock it on from here.

SIMMS :
We're trying to win a tournament,
pardo.

STADLER :
I know. But I'm getting five to

The ANNOUNCER from the GOLF CHANNEL looks at the monitor
where a hand-held camera is picking up Stadler motioning
Tin Cup over.

18 BACK TO COURSE 18
Stadler, McCord, and Mickelson are smiling at the bet.
This is golf. But Simms snarls at being challenged.
Stadler drops a ball in the rough for Tin Cup to hit.

STADLER :
Here ya go. Take a hack at it.

SIMMS :
Balls versus brains, Roy. You
hit that shot, just keep walking,
'cuz your ass is fired.
Tin Cup mulls over the warning, as:
STADLER, McCORD, MICKELSON
Come on, Roy! Your fans are
calling!


                                    Page 29/150

Stadler waves his arms to summon a cheer from the gallery.
Tin Cup puts down Simms's golf bag.

TIN CUP :
How you gonna fire me in front of
all these people? Especially when
I knock it on the green.
And he heads over to where Stadler and the others stand
waiting.

TIN CUP :
You can't fire me. How can youfire me? I just knocked it stifffrom two

Tin Cup reaches for the bag. The guy holds onto it.
They wrestle briefly, as Simms sighs with fatigue andlooks for a marshal.

SIMMS :
Security!
Tin Cup gives up wrestling when he sees a couple marshalsapproaching. He
turns his anger on Simms.

TIN CUP :
What about my money?

SIMMS :
You just hit the shot that tookyou out of the money. Welcome to
life on the tour.
Tin Cup goes after the bag again. The guy still hangs
on. The marshals arrive, and begin to wrestle with TinCup. He goes
berserk... a WWF battle royal.

Romeo scoops balls into wire buckets from the garbage canof water where the
balls are washing. Tin Cup sits on abench, alternately swigging cheap
whiskey and Maalox.

TIN CUP :
If I had it all to do over, I'd
still hit that shot.

ROMEO :
(nods with neither
rancor nor irony)
The look comes over your face, you
would bury yourself alive to prove
you can handle a shovel.
Tin Cup looks over at Romeo for signs of an implied
pejorative. But Romeo's just washing and scooping
balls... and looking badly in need of perspective.

TIN CUP :
You know why I'd still hit that
shot?
Now Romeo looks over... and he decides that Tin Cup is
the one in need of perspective.

ROMEO :
'Cuz it's the only way you can
beat David Simms. 'Cuz you never
got over that he is on tour and
you are not. 'Cuz you get that
look on your face...

TIN CUP :
No...
(pauses, adding
weight to his
thoughts)
I'd hit it again because that shot
was a defining moment. And when a
defining moment comes along you
define the moment or the moment
defines you. I did not shrink
from the challenge. I rose to it.


                                   Page 32/150

Romeo nods, holding his peace.

ROMEO :

That's why most people, in theirwhole lives, never ever reach for
the brass ring, never know when todig deep and try for theimpossible
shot...

She dances away from him, not exactly sold on the idea.
She dances back to him, reclines a leg on the partition,
and moves her face opposite his.

DOREEN :
Roy, I'm not as dumb as my hair

She twirls off. He chases her, beer and entries in hand.

TIN CUP :
Now wait, Doreen. You gotta do
the math, and you gotta look at
how good I'm playing. I hit the

TIN CUP :
Quit trying to wring that club's

He moves around behind her to reposition her shoulders.

TIN CUP :
Remember, this game's about trust
and touch and letting go. So
while I'm subtly enhancing your
technical prospects, why don't you
tell me all about your personal

Romeo ponders Tin Cup's dilemma from the couch.

ROMEO :
Man, you are having a bad week.

TIN CUP :
She must think I'm such a nothing,
such a loser... a lousy drivingrange pro living in a Winnebago,
making five bucks an hour pluslessons.

ROMEO :
She don't know you live in aWinnebago.


                                  Page 37/150

TIN CUP :
Well, she sure as hell knows I
ain't taking her to no Doral formassages and mimosas all weekend.
I gotta do something with my life.
He reflects deeply while Romeo shrugs.

TIN CUP :
I gotta rise to a level worthy ofthe women that think I'm a joke.

ROMEO :
Well... you could go out and winThe Open.

TIN CUP :
(pausing, asif jarred)
Romeo, that idea has promise.
I was joking.

ROMEO :
I ain't.

TIN CUP:
34.

ROMEO :
We talking about the same
tournament? The U.S. Open? The
Biggest golf tournament in the
world?

TIN CUP :
Not just the biggest golf
Tournament in the world; the most
democratic.

ROMEO :
What do you mean?

TIN CUP :
I mean it's open. Anyone's got a
shot at it. You just gotta get
past a local and a sectional
qualifier, and unlike Doral or
Colonial or the A.T.T., they can't


                                    Page 38/150

keep you out. They can't ask you
if you're a garbageman or a bean-
picker or a driving range pro
whose check is signed by a
stripper. You qualify, you're in.

ROMEO :
And then you pay out of your own
pocket to go there and get all
nervous and intimidated -

TIN CUP :
Who's intimidated? I just told
you I'm gonna win the damn thing!

ROMEO :
You don't got the game.

TIN CUP :
I got every shot in the book.

ROMEO :
I said you don't got the game.
The mental game. The head game.

TIN CUP :
You suggesting I err on the side
of excess?

ROMEO :
You always go out to shoot zero.
Sometimes you pull it off. But
you can't play like that at the
Open. You win by taking what the
course gives you. You win by
being humble, which you aren't,
and patient, which you never will

be.
Tin Cup comes over to the couch, sits down, and puts an
arm around Romeo.

TIN CUP :
Well, since you're the authority,


                                    Page 39/150

How'd you like to teach me how to
be what I ain't and never will be?

ROMEO :
You don't ever listen to me.

TIN CUP :
This time'll be different. I
promise.

ROMEO :
I don't know, man. Right now you
don't even got the money to get
your clubs out of hock.

TIN CUP :
Yeah, well... my sticks may be in
a pawn shop, but I got a rake and
a hoe at the range.

The trunk opens. A set of expensive golf clubs is

turns to face Tin Cup and Romeo who is reaching into
the trunk of Roy's Cadillac.

BOONE :
Let me get this straight -- you're
going to play me for four hundred
dollars with those?
Romeo removes an old golf bag from the trunk. It
contains a rake, a hoe, a baseball bat, and assorted
garden tools.

TIN CUP :
And I'll give ya two a side... I
got the title to my car as
collateral.

BOONE :

That's cuz you think of it astransportation, Boone. Think of
it as bragging rights. Think of
yourself sitting around the barcrowing to your buddies about theCadillac

They'll forget all about theWinnebago you lost to me.

Boone addresses the ball on the first tee.

BOONE :

he rips a drive down the fairway.

BOONE :

Tin Cup selects the baseball bat from his golf bag.
Romeo hands him a pink ball and Tin Cup shows it toBoone.

TIN CUP :
I'll be playing a Pink Lady today.

BOONE :
That little pink fag ball supposedto rattle me?
Tin Cup moves over to the tee markers.

TIN CUP :
Not unless I knock it by you.
And he tosses up the Pink Lady and fungoes it long andstraight down the
fairway.

Hell on the toe.
Boone knocks an iron onto the edge of the green.

BOONE :
Drive for show, putt for dough, big
shot.

TIN CUP :
Did you hear that, Romeo? Boone
was being profound! He has
revealed to me the essential
mystery of golf! Drive for show,
putt for dough...
(holds out
a palm)
Louisville Slugger, please.
Boone's a little rattled by Tin Cup's insouciance.

ROMEO :
You got Boone shakin' already -(

approach)

Front left bunker -- plugged lie.
He tosses up the ball and fungoes a lazy fly ball.

CUT TO:
35 EXT. MESQUITE 1ST GREEN AND SAND TRAP - DAY 35
Boone gazes with malicious delight at Tin Cup's ball,
buried in the front left bunker. He watches Tin Cup take
the hoe from Romeo and move down into the trap.

BOONE :
I want to see a legitimate swing.
No scooping.
Tin Cup holds up a hand like a gallery marshal requesting
silence.

TIN CUP :
Stand, please. Gallery, please,

stand.
38.
He addresses the ball, choking down on the hoe,
positioning the blade at an odd angle. He hacks at the
ball with an unorthodox chopping motion. The ball pops
up in the air, lands on the green, releases and rolls up
a foot from the hole.
Boone's jaw drops. Tin Cup hit an impossible shot with
utter ease and facility.

TIN CUP :
I'll finish.
Tin Cup trades Romeo the shovel for the rake, takes the
pin out of the hole, and pool cues the putt home. Par.
Boone looks at his own sixty-foot putt and he knows he's
just been had... utterly, embarrassingly, and thoroughly.
Without a word he counts four hundred dollars from his
roll and drops it on the green.

BOONE :
Get the hell off my course.
38 EXT. PAWN SHOP - DAY 38
Tin Cup and Romeo emerge, Romeo carrying T.C.'s sticks.

TIN CUP:
Listen, swami, your job is to
teach me patience and humility,
not to advise me on my love life.

ROMEO:
No. My job is to get your head
straight so you can qualify for
The Open, much less win it. To
get your head straight you got to
forget about the doctor lady.
They head up the street under a collonade toward Tin
Cup's waiting Caddy.

TIN CUP:
Not all my thinking occurs below
the belt. I actually stand for a
few things beside where my next
romantic interlude is coming from.




                                    Page 43/150

ROMEO:
Then you got no problem telling
the doctor lady you can't teach
her no more till after the Open.
Tin Cup blinks silently a moment, feeling slightly cornered.
39.

TIN CUP :
That would make an issue of
something that ain't an issue.
Besides, I'm focused.
Romeo responds with a Spanish curse.

TIN CUP :
I mean, this is my quest!

ROMEO :
Ahhh... your quest... chingaso...

TIN CUP :
This is where I stand up for all
the little guys everywhere who've
had their fill of soulless robots
like David Simms -

ROMEO :
He may be a soulless robot but
he's a rich, happy soulless robot
with a beautiful doctor lady
girlfriend who's got you by the
huevos -
(beat)
Besides, how is getting into the
U.S. Open gonna change what she
thinks about you?

TIN CUP :
It'll prove to her that I'm not
who she thinks I am.

ROMEO :
But you are who she thinks you
are! Look, I don't bet on a
horse with a hard-on.

I don't feel nothing! Here!

Hey, hey... shit... cool it...

Suddenly a convertible passes -- Simms and Molly, 39
laughing, carefree, enjoying each other. The couple in
the car doesn't see Tin Cup grabbing his crotch making
a fool of himself on the sidewalk -- but Tin Cup and
Romeo see them.

The car disappears down the street. Tin Cup cools off,
chilled, really -- and full of chagrin.

TIN CUP :
Okay, okay... maybe I got a semi.

Maybe you should treat her morelike a lady.

She did that after you let herdump you. It wouldn't kill youjust once to

TIN CUP:
Great, Romeo, just great... just
when I need you to be my friend
and coach, you go get all gooey
about one of my ex-girlfriends
who just happens to be our boss.

ROMEO :
Anybody comes to me for help on
their love life about women is
already too far gone.

TIN CUP :
I don't recall asking you for
advice.

Women are tougher to figure out
than a feathered one iron from a
tight lie -
Suddenly a golf image relaxes them into their comfort
zone.

ROMEO :
Actually if you open the club face
a hair and play it off your back
foot -

TIN CUP :
Shut up, Romeo... I wasn't really
seeking golf tips...

ROMEO :
It's all I'm good for -- but you
can count on me for that, at
least.

TIN CUP :
How far off the back foot?

ROMEO :
'Bout three balls...
Silence. Golf is so much easier than life.

TIN CUP :
I'm ready to charge forth in
pursuit of my mythic destiny and I
can't get time off work to do it.

ROMEO :
I'm no expert, but it seems to me
that the `pursuit of a person's
mythic destiny' is not the sort of
thing that a person needs to get
off a five dollar an hour job in
order to do...

TIN CUP :
I'm stuck. Buried. My life's a

I need help. I need advice. I
need counsel...

I need a shrink.

ROMEO :
You don't know no shrinks.

TIN CUP :
I know one.

ROMEO :
Not the doctor lady?

TIN CUP :
Why not?

ROMEO :
You can't ask advice about the
woman you're trying to hose from
the woman you're trying to hose!

TIN CUP :
Hose?! Hose?! Get your mouth
outta the gutter! This is a
matter of the heart!

CUT TO:
A42 EXT. MAIN STREET (SALOME) - DAY A42
Tin Cup's Caddy pulls up and he gets out, goes to the
front of a store that is now a health services office.
He looks around warily -- as if someone might see him
entering such a place -- and ducks inside.
43.

CUT TO:
B42 INT. SMALL ROOM - DAY B42
It's the exit, ""cool down"" room, not the waiting room.
Tin Cup sits nervously, he's slightly overdressed forthe occasion. He looks


                                   Page 48/150

childlike.
The door to the inner office opens -- a woman comes outand sits down across
from him. She's weepinguncontrollably. He stares. He fidgets. He's nervous,

out of place.
Finally Molly enters through the same door because shehears the crying. She
sees Tin cup -- an awkward moment,
then -TIN

CUP :
I didn't do anything!

MOLLY :
I know... I know... wait in there.
Tin Cup slips into the main office while Molly consolesthe weeping woman.

CUT TO:
42 INT. MOLLY'S OFFICE - FEW BEATS LATER - DAY 42
Tin Cup is dutifully lying on the couch because heheard that's what you do.
He stares at the ceiling.
Molly enters and sits down.

MOLLY :
Roy... are you okay?

TIN CUP :
I need therapy.
Obviously.

MOLLY :

TIN CUP :
What do I do? I mean... to do it
... therapy... I mean, how do Istart doing... it.

MOLLY :
In parlance you might understand,
just kick back and let the Big Dog
eat.
He sighs and plunges in.

TIN CUP:
Okay, okay, let 'er rip...


                                 Page 49/150

(deep breath)
Suppose there's this guy. He's
standing on the shore of a big,
wide river. And the river's fulla
all manner of disaster, like
alligators and piranhas and
currents and eddies, and most
people won't even go down there to
dip a toe. But on the other side
of the river's a million dollars,
and on this side of the river
there's a rowboat. I guess my

question's this:
possess the guy on shore to swim
for it?

MOLLY :
He's an idiot.

TIN CUP :
No. He's a hell of a swimmer,
see. His problem's more like...
why's he always gotta rise to the
challenge?

MOLLY :
He's a juvenile idiot.

TIN CUP :
You don't understand what I mean
by the river.

MOLLY :
We're talking about you and what
you like to call your inner
demons, Roy, that human frailty
you like to blather about, not
some mytho-poetic metaphor you
come up with in a feeble and
transparent effort to do yourself
credit.

TIN CUP :


                                    Page 50/150

Y'mean you're gonna make me feel
lousy? I came here to feel better
-- what kinda therapy is this?

MOLLY :
You don't have any inner demons.
What you have is inner crapola,
inner debris -- garbage, loose
wires, horseshit in staggering
amounts.
45.

TIN CUP :
I ain't just some jerk driving-
range pro who drinks too much
booze and eats too few vegetables.

MOLLY :
You're being defensive -- cut to
the chase and tell me why you're
here.

TIN CUP :
Well... I'm smitten with a woman.

MOLLY :
That's good. Is she smitten with
you?

TIN CUP :
Not yet.

MOLLY :
Have you asked her out?

TIN CUP :
She's seeing a guy. I don't know
how serious it is, but the guy's a
real horse's ass, in my opinion...

MOLLY :
If you shared your heart with this
woman -- maybe asked her out to
dinner -- then it would force


                                    Page 51/150

these issues out in the open.

TIN CUP :
I'm afraid she'll say no.

MOLLY :
Ahh... so what you're saying is
that all your speeches about
swimming across the shark infested
waters are really just about your
golf game -- not about your
personal life.

TIN CUP :
Christ, I didn't know we were
gonna get into my personal life!

MOLLY :
This is therapy!

TIN CUP :
Well, jeez, I know, but I didn't
think it was that kind of
therapy...
46.

MOLLY :
What were you expecting? Ann
Landers?

TIN CUP :
Yeah.

MOLLY :
Look, it's rather simple. Those
risks that you love to take on the
golf course, the risks you talk so
passionately and poetically about
-- you need to apply those risks
to your personal life with the
same passion.

TIN CUP :
I should ask this woman out.


                                   Page 52/150

MOLLY :
Yes!

TIN CUP :
I should risk coming right over
the top and snap-hooking it out of
bounds left.

MOLLY :
Yes!

TIN CUP :
Risk hitting it a little thin
and -

MOLLY :
For Godsakes, Roy, that's enough!

TIN CUP :
Right. Sorry.

MOLLY :
S'okay...
(beat)
Look, just walk up to this woman,
wherever she is, look her in the
eye with those big beautiful green
eyes of yours, let down your guard
and don't try to be smooth or cool
or whatever -- just be honest and
take the risk -- you can do it!
Tin Cup rises with new confidence. He does several deep
breathing exercises, trying to work up the courage. She
stares at him. And he walks right up to her.

TIN CUP :
Dr. Griswold -- I think I'm in

love with you.
Molly is stunned.

MOLLY :
What?!


                                    Page 53/150

TIN CUP :
From the moment I first saw you I
knew I was through with bar girls
and strippers and motorcycle
chicks, and when you started
talking I was smitten and I'm
smitten more every day I think
about you -- and the fact that
you know I'm full of crapola
only makes you more attractive
to me because usually I can
bullshit people but I can't
bullshit you and in addition, most
women I'm thinking about how to get
into their pants from Day One but
with you I'm just thinking about
how to get into your heart -
Molly was clue-less. She just stares.

MOLLY :
My God...

TIN CUP :
(optimistically,
proudly)
Stunned, eh? So what about dinner
and we can talk about `us' and if
we have a future and how to drop
that horse's ass boyfriend of
yours -

MOLLY :
Roy, slow down -

TIN CUP :
Hey! I just hit a eight degree
driver off a cart path here, I'm
staring eagle in the face -

MOLLY :
This is a terrible mistake!
Tin Cup is knocked off his horse. Into deep rough.




                                    Page 54/150

TIN CUP :
I'm acting from the heart so I
can't make a mistake?! Right?
48.

MOLLY :
Wrong. Aw, shit...
(beat)
I am one horrible shrink...
jeez... I didn't know you were
talking about me.

TIN CUP :
Would your advice have been
different?
She's frustrated and at a loss for words.

MOLLY :
Session's over. You better leave.
Crushed, Tin Cup heads to the door, stops and turns.

TIN CUP :
I'm gonna qualify for the U.S.
Open and kick your boyfriend's
ass.

MOLLY :
Please leave.

TIN CUP :
Whatever you think of me, you
should know that your boyfriend
hates old people, children, and
dogs.
He exits. She just sits there.

CUT TO:
43 EXT. DRIVING RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT 43
The lone figure of Tin Cup stands on a tee, arching SEVEN
IRONS -- THWOCK! -- into the night, serenaded by CRICKETS
and the occasional BUG-LIGHT ZAPPING a fly.
Romeo and the regulars stand behind Tin Cup observing
approvingly. Tin Cup mutters something with every swing.
It sounds like he's saying -


                                  Page 55/150

TIN CUP :
(just before
swinging)
Dollar bills...
Tin Cup hits another shot, totally focused.

TIN CUP :
Dollar bills...
49.

ROMEO :
How'd it go with the doctor lady,
boss?

TIN CUP :
If she was a par three, I'd'a made
a nine.

ROMEO :
Stroke and distance, eh?

TIN CUP :
(nods, deep in
concentration)
Dollar bills...
Romeo backs off to let the man practice, and Clint asks:

CLINT :
What's he saying?

ROMEO :
Dollar bills. His divots got to
look like dollar bills. 'Course
Moe Norman hits divots like bacon
strips 'cuz he come over the top,
but that's gettin' too technical
for you.
Clint turns and nods approvingly to the rest of the
regulars.

CLINT :
See that, boys? He's hitting
dollar bills. Tightening his


                                    Page 56/150

game.
They murmur approval, but Earl catches Clint's eye and
jerks his head at Tin Cup, indicating Clint isn't doing
his job as group spokesman. Clint takes a step forward.

CLINT :
Uh, something us shitheels want
you to know, Tin Cup, is uh, well,
we been to see Doreen, and we told
her we'd stage a customer's strike
if she didn't give you time off to
win the Open.
This remark penetrates Tin Cup's concentration. He turns
with a smile to the regulars.

TIN CUP :
You perverts did that for me?

JOSE :
We believe in you, man.
50.

EARL:
And if you get past the local
qualifier, we gonna sponsor you.
Tin Cup looks at the beaming faces of the regulars and
smiles broadly.

TIN CUP:
Thanks, boys -- a man couldn't
have better friends. Now move the
hell back and shut the fuck up.
You're messing up my
concentration.
And with big smiles, they move each other back so as not
to mess up Tin Cup's concentration. And he pulls out
another ball, mutters dollar bills, and hits another
perfect shot.

DISSOLVE TO:
44 EXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT (LATER) 44
Everyone's gone home except Tin Cup, who keeps drilling
beautiful shots into the Texas night.

CUT TO:
45 EXT. ADJACENT HIGHWAY - NIGHT 45
A car is parked unnoticed. A figure sits alone, watching
Tin Cup from a distance. Molly.
MOLLY'S POV - SOLITARY FIGURE OF TIN CUP
With his elegant swing, as graceful as he is crude, a Zen
ritual. Finally, weary at last, Tin Cup tosses his club
in his bag and drags it toward his ever-present
Winnebago, which we see him enter.

CUT TO:
46 INT. WINNEBAGO - NIGHT 46
He drops his clubs on the couch. The place is a wreck,
and he collapses in a chair, CRACKING a CAN of cheap
BEER.
A KNOCK at the door. He's startled.

TIN CUP :
Debt collection? Process server?
51.
Ex-flame? Jesus, I'm clean.
(disguises his
voice)
Who is it?
The door opens -- Molly enters. He's surprised but well-
settled into his bath of cynicism.

MOLLY:
God, you've got a beautiful
swing -

TIN CUP:
-- And big, beautiful green eyes
-- I'm a beautiful guy.

MOLLY :
I came here to apologize.

TIN CUP :
For what?

MOLLY:
Well, I counseled you, you did
exactly what I said, and I just...


                                   Page 58/150

poured cold water over your
effort.
(quickly)
I didn't get it. I'm a terrible
shrink, probably... I should've
never got out of real estate -
actually I should never have
left Ohio for that cowboy in
Armarillo -- have you ever been
to Amarillo?

TIN CUP :
A cowboy?

MOLLY:
It's not as romantic when you're
actually with one -- a wrangler,
y'know -- so of course the oil
man in Dallas looked great after
that -- I don't know what I was
thinking... That's when I went to
the gulf and ended up in, well,
trailer sales and then all those
condos in Corpus Christi -- the
bottom fell outta the market and
I needed a new gig -

TIN CUP :
A new gig?

MOLLY :
Therapy. I took all the classes.
52.
I'm licensed, y'know.
(suddenly dejected)
Oh God...
(reaching into her
purse)
Mind if I smoke?
(lights up)
Anyway, I'm flattered you asked me
out. I can't accept because I am
involved with David and I haven't
seen any evidence that he treats


                                    Page 59/150

old people, kids or dogs badly.

TIN CUP :
I got a little carried away, I
guess. I shoulda just layed up,
made my par, and moved on.

MOLLY :
Look, I want to propose something
-- as long as you understand this
is professional -- we're not going
out together -

TIN CUP :
Tee it up.

MOLLY :
I can help you with the mental
aspects of the game. You've got
Romeo to be your swing doctor, I
can be your head doctor.

TIN CUP :
But you said you were a lousy shrink?

MOLLY :
Well, yeah... I'll improve.

TIN CUP :
I got no money to pay for you.

MOLLY :
I'll trade my services for golf
lessons and help you through the
qualifying. If you get into the
Open, well, you're on your own.

TIN CUP :
You'll be with David.

MOLLY :
Yeah...
Silence. A deal. It's the best they can do.

The regulars applaud and whistle and shout way too many
""You the man's!"" as Tin Cup steps onto the first tee,
followed by his Sancho Panza, Romeo. Tin Cup is feeling
on top of the world, at his cocky best.

to Molly.

ROMEO :
(softly)
Looks like we partners, Dr. Molly

MOLLY :
I just have to help him keep his
head on straight -

ROMEO :
If you can, you be the first.

MOLLY :
He does have the occasional
tendency towards self-destruction
it seems.

ROMEO :
It ain't occasional and it ain't
no tendency -- it's a fact of life
that he gonna blow sky high, it's
just a matter of when and how
fast can the pieces be put back
together.

Behind that twinkle in his eyes is
nitroglycerin.
Tin Cup waves and motions to his team.

TIN CUP :
Quiet in the gallery! A man's
trying to do his job.
And Tin Cup uncoils a mighty drive with an elegant
stroke, fully confident and smooth. The gallery
applauds.

Molly leans to Romeo just before they all head down the
fairway and confides -

I find him mildly attractive when
he's obnoxious and arrogant like
this -

Tin Cup's on a roll and needs no help. So far...
A couple of the regulars shout out encouragement.

nothing bugs me -- except
insufficient applause.
(surveying the
fairway)
Gimme the lumber.
But Romeo is handing him a two iron.

ROMEO :
I think two iron's safer.

TIN CUP :
I said I want the Big Dog.
Romeo looks warily down the fairway of a tight dogleg
left par five.

ROMEO :
Tight par five, out of bounds
left... you don't want to hit
driver.

TIN CUP :
I'm not going left of those trees.
I'm going over those trees... with

a little draw. That way I get
home in two. That way I'm putting
for eagle.

ROMEO :
You don't need eagle to qualify!
You need to get used to playing
smart --no mistakes wins the
Open.

TIN CUP :
Qualify? I want the course
record! Now gimme the lumber!
Tin Cup reaches for the driver. Romeo shifts the golf
bag beyond Tin Cup's reach.

ROMEO :
You not going to listen to me?
You don't care I'm trying to help?
You think I'm full of shit?

TIN CUP :
I think I'm gonna get penalized
for slow play if you don't give me
that fucking driver.

were, always will be.

Then let's ask the head doctor.
Dr. Griswold?

Dr. Griswold, should I hit the Big
Dog or the two?
Suddenly an OFFICIAL steps forward.

Soliciting shot selection advice

TIN CUP :
(to Romeo)
Ha! Gimme the driver and shut up.
Romeo pulls out the driver and he snaps it in half over
his knee. He tosses the two halves on the ground near
Tin Cup.

ROMEO :
... Go ahead. Hit the driver.
Tin Cup looks at the two halves of his driver, curbing
his anger, not giving Romeo the satisfaction of a
reaction.

TIN CUP :
I changed my mind. Gimme the
three wood.

ROMEO :
You can't clear the dogleg with a
three wood.

TIN CUP :
Wanna bet?
Romeo pulls out the three wood, snaps it over his knee,
and tosses the halves on the ground next to the driver
halves. Tin Cup turns with amusement to his playing
partners, lest they think management has lost the upper
hand with labor.

TIN CUP :
Guess I'm going with the safe
shot, boys.
Tin Cup reaches for the two iron, studies it a moment,
frowns, and then:
He snaps it over his knee. He dumps these halves on the
ground with the halves of the driver and three wood.
58.
Romeo stares, aghast. Tin Cup merely shrugs.

TIN CUP :
Sometimes I fan that two iron.
Better gimme the three.
Romeo warily hands Tin Cup the three iron. Tin Cup looks


                                    Page 66/150

at it, frowns, then:
He snaps it over his knee and tosses it on the ground.
Molly leans over to the regulars.

MOLLY :
Is this normal behavior for him?

EARL :
The word 'normal' and him don't
collide in the same sentence too
often.
She watches in amazement as -

TIN CUP :
Sometimes I catch that three a
little thin...
He drops the three iron halves with the other halves, and
steps past Romeo and sequentially yanks all but the seven
iron from his bag.
He snaps them over his knee, one by one, citing the
crimes of each club with mounting absurdity and ire.

TIN CUP :
And I've hooked my four iron...

... and hit flyers with the
five...

... and shanked the six...

Then, he reaches for the last club in his bag, the seveniron. The regulars
hold their breath, thinking this isthe end of Tin Cup's Open bid. But...
Tin Cup smiles and caresses the seven ironaffectionately.

TIN CUP :
But the seven iron, I never miss
the seven iron. It's the onlytruly safe club in my bag.
He moves to the tee, drops a ball, and hits it down themiddle with the
seven iron.

TIN CUP :
You happy, Romeo?

ROMEO :
No, boss, I'm tired... my life'stoo short to spend it watching youfall
apart. I done it too manytimes.
Romeo turns and starts walking away.

19TH HOLE WAITRESS
Beer for everybody.

CLINT :
You the man, Tin Cup!
A toast is raised to their king, and Tin Cup eats it up.

TIN CUP :
Thanks, boys, what'ya think was mybest shot -- the seven iron on
twelve, the seven iron on
fourteen, or maybe it was thebunker shot on eighteen which, tomy
recollection was a -- seven iron?
Much laughter. This is the Tin Cup they love.

EARL :
You definitely the man!

TIN CUP :
How'd I do, Doc?

MOLLY :
(cheerfully)
You failed miserably.

TIN CUP:
What?! I parred the back nine
with a seven iron, I qualified for
the regionals, I -

MOLLY :
Your job is not just to qualify
for the Open, it's to prepare for
the Open. My job is to help you
prepare.

TIN CUP:
You said to 'trust my feelings'!

MOLLY :
I didn't know you felt like
breaking all the clubs in your
bag.

CLINT :
He didn't break the seven!

EARL :
He smoked that seven, brother -

MOLLY :
From what I understand, the U.S.
Open is the most difficult golf
tournament in the world played
under the most difficult
circumstances with the greatest
players -- winning it means
controlling yourself, managing
your emotions, staying cool, not
getting in a pissing contest with
your caddie who, incidentally,
quit.

TIN CUP :
He always quits, he always comes
back.

MOLLY :
Nonetheless, from the mental
aspect -- which is my domain -you
have regressed and are
fumbling somewhere between
delusion and denial.




                                    Page 70/150

TIN CUP :
'Regression, delusion, denial'?
You gotta use all this
psychological language?

MOLLY :
I'm a psychologist.

Tin Cup turns to the regulars for support.
VOICE (O.S.)
Have a bad day, Roy?
Everyone turns to see David Simms enter the conversation.

MOLLY :
Hi, honey...

TIN CUP :
I shot 65 -- parred the backside
with a seven iron.

SIMMS :
(intrigued)
Why?

MOLLY :
That's the question -- why?
Silence.

CLINT :
'Cause he broke all his other
clubs.

EARL :
Snapped 'em in two -- even the
putter.

SIMMS :
Jesus, Roy, I'm on your side here.
We go way back... I hope you get
into the Open, but if you don't
play under control, you'll get
slaughtered. Good players shoot
82 in the Open. You can't always
go for it.

TIN CUP :
Swear to God, Doc, this guy is
not who you think.

CLINT :
It's a well-known fact that if a
camera's not on him, he treats old
people and children like dirt.

EARL :
And dogs.

TIN CUP :
Yeah, don't forget the dogs.

MOLLY :
I think we should go, David.
63.

SIMMS :
I think so...
Tin Cup's worst characteristics flare up, he won't let
go.

TIN CUP :
You ever shoot par with a seven
iron?

SIMMS :
It never occurred to me to try.
(to Molly)
C'mon, let's go. The car's over
here....

TIN CUP :
I'll bet you a thousand dollars
against my car that I can beat you
in any game -- any game, you name
it -- with a seven iron.

SIMMS :
This is ridiculous.




                                  Page 72/150

TIN CUP :
You a coward? You gonna lay up
the way you did at the Masters
last year?

REGULARS :
(taunting, like
children)
Chickie, chickie, chickie...
Simms is a little drawn in, not so much by the challenge
as the desire to shut up Tin Cup.

SIMMS :
Any game, I name it?

MOLLY :
Oh, come on, David -

SIMMS :
I just want to teach him a lesson.

MOLLY :
Why do men insist on measuring
their dicks?
Tin Cup takes her literally and rises, starting to
unbuckle his belt.

TIN CUP :
Awright, awright! Let's measure,
64.
right now!

MOLLY :
For God sakes, I wasn't being
literal!
(beat)
David, let's go.

SIMMS :
Molly, trust me on this one. Call
it part of his mental preparation
for the Open, where the rough is
deep, the greens are slick, and
the nerves are shattered.

(to Tin Cup)
I'll take the bet.

MOLLY :
Oh, jeez...
The Regulars cheer -- this is what they live for. Simms
hands a roll of cash to Molly. Tin Cup hands her his car
keys.

TIN CUP :
Awright! What's the game?

SIMMS :
One swing each. Who can hit the
longest seven iron -

TIN CUP :
It's a lock! I hit the seven like
John Daly hits a three!
The Regulars whoop it up. Their man's a cinch. Tin Cup
pulls a ball from his pocket, drops it right on the
ground in the middle of the patio.

TIN CUP :
From right here, okay?

SIMMS :
Fine with me.

MOLLY :
You guys are really being
childish -

SIMMS :
Molly, leave this one to me.

TIN CUP :
Dr. Griswold, I know what I'm
doing.
Tin Cup takes a couple of swings to limber up, aiming out

TIN CUP :
(to himself)
Dollar bills...
He takes a full back-swing, opens beautifully, and
launches a seven iron like a rocket out toward some
driving range markers... to ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" from his
faithful.
The ball lands at a 170 yard marker and bounces further.

CLINT :
Them signs are at least thirty
yards farther -- that ball musta
gone 220...

TIN CUP :
That ball's about 2-2-7... toed it
a bit... but it'll do...

REGULARS :
Nearly 230 with a seven! Pureed
it, baby, he pureed it!
Tin Cup hands Simms the seven iron.

TIN CUP :
Take a minute to limber up, fine
with me -

SIMMS :
Don't need to.
Simms is still in a sport jacket, slacks, no golf shoes.

TIN CUP :
Take your jacket off?

SIMMS :
No, no, I'm fine.
Simms drops a ball about where Tin Cup's sat. He stands
above the ball and addresses it.

TIN CUP:
(cockily)
You're gonna need to muscle up,
big guy -- give it the old steroid
jerk...


                                   Page 75/150

Simms is cool as ice. He smiles, then moves around to
the other side of the ball, suddenly facing away from the
course. This baffles everyone.

REGULARS :

Guys pull out singles and larger bills around the runway,

placing them on the railing for the gyrating stripper.

SAMMANTHA :
(to Tin Cup)
Hey, honey...
67.
Tin Cup tosses some money onstage with a lackluster
wave, he's depressed -- or something.

TIN CUP :
Hey, honey...

DOREEN :
I heard you qualified for the
Regionals -- why you so down?

TIN CUP :
I broke my clubs -- don't ask why,
my caddie's pissed off at me, I
lost my wheels in a sucker bet,
and my shrink thinks I'm a fool -'
cause I probably am...

DOREEN :
You're seeing a therapist?!

TIN CUP :
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

DOREEN :
Only way you'd ever go into
therapy was if the shrink was a
doll and you were trying to get
her into the rack -

TIN CUP :
You're so shallow. The Good
Doctor and I are dealing with my
regression and denial -

DOREEN :
Oh, Tin Cup, what a crock. You
got a hard-on.
A GUY from the next table leans over, interrupting.


                                   Page 77/150

GUY :
You `Tin Cup'? Won the Local with
a seven iron?

TIN CUP :
That's me.

GUY :
McAvoy? The Tin Cup McAvoy?

DOREEN :
There's only one -- thank God...

TIN CUP :
Yeah. You looking for a game?
68.

GUY :
No, but I'd sure like to show you
my grip...
Doreen can't keep his attention. Neither can Sammantha,
who writhes only a few feet away.

DOREEN :
How long have you been seeing this
`Good Doctor'?

TIN CUP :
Excuse me, Dor', the man's having
trouble with his grip -
The Guy slides over to Tin Cup, quickly joined by his
buddies.

GUY :
See, I used to play a real weak
grip. But you look at Couples,
he's got a left hand way over
here...
Tin Cup glances at the guy's grip.

TIN CUP :
No, grip it like this, so you're
holding on with the last two


                                    Page 78/150

fingers of your left hand.
The Guy nudges the COWBOY next to him.

GUY :
See that? Tin Cup McAvoy says you
grip a golf club like this, with
these two fingers.

DOREEN :
Roy?
(off no response)
Roy? Tin Cup? Hello?

TIN CUP :
The grip and address are about 90
percent of the golf swing, so pay
attention here...

COWBOY :
When you're done with him, can I
ask you about my club position at
address?
Sammantha can't keep their attention, either, even though
she's down to a G-string, inches away. At the height of
the MUSIC, she stops dancing and looks down at Doreen -
69.

SAMMANTHA :
Am I doing something wrong?

DOREEN :
No, honey, you ain't -- but ahealthy woman's only got twochoices in this
world of ours...
(beat)
Either fall in love with another
woman -- or take up golf.
And Doreen heads to the dressing room, disgusted, but notat all surprised.
She knows Tin Cup -- she knows men.

TIN CUP :
... Now the stronger right-handgrip can help ya draw the ball,
which I plan to do at theRegionals next week in Tulsa...
just shift the hand over a littlebit... blah, blah, blah...
... And naked women dance before them, unnoticed.

She can't travel to Arizona for

as spiffy as all them big-name
pros.

TIN CUP :
But I got the shanks -

DOREEN :
Yeah, and you obviously still have
a hard-on for the doctor chick -your
face is all screwed up and
tight like you haven't been laid
in awhile -

TIN CUP :
Is it really that obvious?

DOREEN :
It's not a good look for you.
Roy, your heart is not the only
organ you wear on your sleeve.
There's a certain, vulgar appeal
to your transparency.
Tin Cup shrugs. She always has him outflanked.

CLINT :
C'mon, Tin Cup, we're trying to
make you a presentation -

TIN CUP :
Awright, awright...
She unwraps a tour golf bag -- Big gold and red lettering
advertises ""The Golden Tassel."" Pastie tassels hang from
all over the bag. Doreen sets it down proudly.

DOREEN :
I got the Golden Tassel to sponsor
you at the Open.

TIN CUP :
You expect me to pack that around?

ROMEO :
I'm carrying the bag.

DOREEN :
It's worth four hundred dollars
endorsement money to you -
Earl steps forward with a golf shirt bedecked with sewn
on patches and logos.
81.

EARL :
See, Dewey got you First State
Banking of Salome, and Clint got
you Short-Haul Trucking and I got
you Brink and Brown sanitation -

TIN CUP :
I'm being sponsored by a sewage
disposal system?

EARL :
We call it human resources
management, Roy, please...
Jose steps forward with a golf cap, also emblazoned.

JOSE :


                                    Page 92/150

I've got Wally's Smokehouse for ya
-- kind of a nice sign...

DEWEY :
And since I couldn't get the post
office to come aboard, me and my
girl friend Muriel's gonna buy a
fan club patch you can put anywhere
you want.
Doreen and the regulars look at Tin Cup proudly.

TIN CUP :
I'm supposed to wear this shit?

JOSE :
This shit is us, man. You can't
win without us.

DOREEN :
You're the pride of Salome!

TIN CUP :
Hell, I won't even make the cut!

DOREEN :
What happened to your confidence?

ROMEO :
He's shanking his love life so
he's shanking the golf ball.

DOREEN :
Must be true love.

ROMEO :
He's a goner.
Tin Cup surveys all the bizarre sponsorship loot, and
starts loosening up. These are his people, after all,
82.
and they're behind him all the way.

TIN CUP :
Look, everybody, this is great.
I'm sorry I'm acting so pathetic


                                    Page 93/150

but my swing's never abandoned me
before. I just need a little time
to work it out.

EARL :
Anything you want -

CLINT :
Give him some room, boys -

TIN CUP :
(to anyone who'll
listen)
Maybe it's my grip... maybe I'm
opening up too soon... too late...
coming over the top... no,
dropping underneath...
(beat)
Oh, sweet Jesus, why have you
abandoned me?

DOREEN:
(to the regulars)
He's trying to talk to God. It's
time for us to go.
Doreen and the regulars quietly slip away to leave Tin
Cup with his newly sponsored gifts and, more importantly,
his newly lost grip, swing, and confidence.

ROMEO :
You want me to stay, boss?

TIN CUP :
I need to be alone.

ROMEO :
You got it.
And Romeo herds the rest of them out to their cars in the
lot. And as they drive away, Tin Cup sits down, his head
in his hands.

She gets out, goes to
She knocks.
Roy?

MOLLY :
Anybody home?
There's no answer so she tries the door, and walks in on:

CUT TO:
82 INT. WINNEBAGO - MORNING 82
Tin Cup stands there caught, like a deer in theheadlights, like a man
caught cross dressing, a privateconfession made public -- he can't run and
he can'thide...
Roy ""Tin Cup"" McAvoy is wearing every gimmick that Mollyfirst arrived with
-- plus many more. He wears a
pendulum cap, his arms are strapped together, a curioustriangular coat
hanger type contraption connects hiselbows, there's a neck brace, an ankle
anchor, an arrow
attachment to his left hand, a bucket for right foot, heswings a
collapsible club... and a BEGINNERS GOLF VIDEOPROJECTS loudly from his VCR,
so loudly that he neverheard her knocking.
My God...

MOLLY :
Aarghh...

TIN CUP :
Roy...

MOLLY :

TIN CUP :
Dr. Griswold...
A moment of pathetic silence, then:
Molly starts laughing -- He is destroyed.

TIN CUP :
The therapist laughs at herpatient? Is that how it works? A
man is laid bare before God and


                                 Page 95/150

he's the butt of the cosmic joke?

MOLLY :
I'm sorry, I just...

TIN CUP :
Some of this shit might actually

work, y'know... I mean I think
there's something to this hat
with the pendulum golf ball
thing... may be on to something
here...

MOLLY :
Oh, Roy, Jesus... Quoting yourself,
'It is the paraphernalia for lost
and desperate souls.'
Tin Cup lets down. The wind goes out of his sails and he
loses his defensiveness.

TIN CUP :
Well, God damn... a lost and
desperate soul stands before you.
(beat)
I assume I have the
confidentiality of doctor-client
privilege in regards to this
outfit?

MOLLY :
Of course you do. What happened?

TIN CUP :
I got the shanks.

MOLLY :
Are you taking penicillin?

TIN CUP :
It can't be treated! It's much
worse than whatever you thought it
was.
(beat)


                                    Page 96/150

There's a glitch in my swing.

MOLLY :
So it's in Romeo's department?

TIN CUP :
He thinks it's your department -says
it's a head thing.

MOLLY :
Oh. Well. I just came over to
congratulate you on the regionals
and return your car -- David says
he doesn't want it, just wanted to
make a point with you -
(beat)
But I suppose we could have a
therapy session right here and now
85.

TIN CUP :
I don't want therapy. I want you.

MOLLY :
Roy... I gotta get some air -

TIN CUP :
Look at me -(
considering what
that means)
Well, not right at the moment -but
listen to me. You're with the
wrong guy. I'm the right guy.
Everyone tells me my face is all
screwed up tight as a drum 'cause
I've been crazy about you from
the day you showed up wearing
this stupid stuff and the whole
damn thing has both inspired
me to get here on the verge of
greatness yet it's also caused
me to get the shanks which
could humiliate me in front of
a zillion people.


                                    Page 97/150

(beat)
Such is life. So dump that phony
bastard and come to the Open in my
corner -- you can delay your
romantic urges, which I know are
lurking in there among the excess
of brain cells you possess -until
the appropriate time...
(beat)
Tell me you're not at least
moderately attracted to me.
Tin Cup stands there with the ball still dangling from
his hat, the leather straps, the bucket, the arrows -for
the moment he's forgotten how stupid he looks.

MOLLY :
You have moments.

TIN CUP :
Tell me which ones are my moments
and I'll try to duplicate them.

MOLLY :
This is a moment. You look great.

TIN CUP :
Now?!

MOLLY :
Utterly exposed, completely
vulnerable, the inner child trying
to get out.
86.

TIN CUP :
My inner child needs spanking.

MOLLY :
You always liked that part about
saddling up, the smell of leather

TIN CUP :
C'mon, let's have a drink. Call
it therapy. Charge me 75 an hour.


                                    Page 98/150

Little Cuervo, little Freud...
She's thinking about it.

MOLLY :
Naw... I gotta go.
(turns to leave)
Oh, I don't have a car, I
need a ride.

CUT TO:
83 EXT. ALONG RIVER BACK TO TOWN - DAY 83
Tin Cup and Molly in his convertible. He works on her
without pushing too hard.

TIN CUP :
I know a spot along the river's
great to watch the sunset?

MOLLY :
Not tonight.

TIN CUP :
'Not tonight' means maybe some
other night?

MOLLY :
I didn't mean it like that.

TIN CUP :
Consciously you didn't mean it
like that -- but how about
unconsciously, you're the expert,
did you mean it unconsciously?

MOLLY :
Unconsciously, Roy, I don't have a
clue what I'm talking about.

TIN CUP :
I feel we're making progress.
87.

MOLLY :
I do too. But I have no idea what


                                    Page 99/150

it's progress towards...
A84 EXT. MOLLY'S OFFICE - DUSK A84
The Caddy pulls up in front of her office at the newmall. She gets out.

MOLLY :
Good luck in the Open, Roy.

TIN CUP :
Put your money on me, Doc, theodds are fabulous and God knows
I'm overdue...
He drives away, and we stay:

CLOSE ON MOLLY :
Watching Tin Cup careen away in his Caddy.

Romeo

ROMEO :
You got to relax, boss -TIN

CUP :
Goin' to the U.S. Open with theshanks. Gonna be chili dipping myway around
the course on worldwidetelevision... sure, relax.

ROMEO :
I'm gonna get rid of them shanksfor ya. No hay problema.

TIN CUP :
Molly and I are circling eachother... I can feel it...

ROMEO :
She the enemy, boss.
Naw...

TIN CUP:

ROMEO :
Well she wakin' up with the enemy
-- same thing.


                                Page 100/150

TIN CUP :
Tell me something, Romes -- the
absolute truth -- you think I can
go 72 holes without falling apart.
Romeo keeps driving, pretends not to hear.

TIN CUP :
You heard me! I don't want no
bullshit... do you think I can do
it?

ROMEO :
I don't know, boss, I just don't
know.
And Tin Cup puts on his Walkman, and stares out the
window endlessly at a thousand miles of passing scenery,
to the MUSIC of GEORGE JONES...

DISSOLVE TO:
86 EXT. DESERT - DAY 86
The WINNEBAGO RUMBLES out of the country heading east,

The Winnebago passes through a ""tunnel"" of tall, old
pines into a cathedral environment of old money and
old golf.
90 INT. WINNEBAGO - DAY 90
Romeo and Tin Cup stare out into the trees, the lushness
-- a couple of wide-eyed kids.

TIN CUP :
I bet this is the first Winnebago
they ever saw here...
89.

ROMEO :


                                Page 101/150

Yeah... and the first Mexican...
The Winnebago pulls up to a guard gate -- A SECURITY
GUARD comes to the window. A banner hangs above the
entrance a few paces past the security gate, proclaiming:
""Old Pines -- U.S. Open Championship.""

SECURITY GUARD :
Yes?

ROMEO :
Como esta, amigo. I have with me
one of the legendary ball strikers
in the history of golf -
The Security Guard strains to see in.

SECURITY GUARD :
Who's that? Mr. Crenshaw? That you?
Mr. Price, Mr. Norman? No?
Tin Cup leans across Romeo to introduce himself.

TIN CUP :
Roy 'Tin Cup' McAvoy.
Representing the great American
Southwest.
The Guard backs off quickly, turns to his SECOND.

SECURITY GUARD :
Do we have a... McCormack... on
the list.

ROMEO :
McAvoy --Roy McAvoy -- he's a
legend!

SECURITY GUARD :
We got over 150 legends in this
tournament. Sorry.
Romeo starts cursing in Spanish. The Guard is unphased.

SECURITY GUARD :
Call the police.

ROMEO :
Police?


                                  Page 102/150

The police quickly appear to take over the situation.
Tin Cup leaps out of the Winnebago to argue his point.

TIN CUP :
There's a mistake here, fellas!
90.
A COP grabs Tin Cup and Roy is ready to fight. It's
getting ugly real fast.

COP :
We'll throw your ass in jail right
now, pal -- there's a lotta
lunatics here and we don't take
chances...
At that moment David Simms pulls in, driving a convertible
sponsor's car. He sees the scuffle, gets
out.

SIMMS :
What's the problem here?

SECURITY GUARD :
This clown says he's in the
Open...
Simms spots Tin Cup -- a delicious moment for him. Tin
Cup wants to hide but he just gamely covers his face.

TIN CUP :
Hiya, David... nice sweater.

SECURITY GUARD :
He's not on the list.
Simms takes the clipboard with the list.

SIMMS :
Hiya, Roy... welcome to the big
leagues...
(checks the list)
Here ya go, Charlie, his name's
right here.
(to Tin Cup)
They spelled your name wrong -easy
mistake with a total unknown.




                                Page 103/150

SECURITY GUARD :
(to Cop)
Let him in.
Simms smiles at Tin Cup, the easy smile of a man on top.
Tin Cup doesn't respond, just asks the Guard:

TIN CUP :
Which way to the practice range?
As Tin Cup tries to regain some dignity, and climbs back
into the Winnebago -
91.

SECURITY GUARD :
(to Simms)
He said he was a 'legend'?

SIMMS:
Oh he is... he's a very big name
at a driving range in Salome,
Texas...
They all have a good laugh, and -

CUT TO:
91 EXT. PRACTICE RANGE - DAY 91
Lots of the big names are there. Romeo is like a kid at
the ballpark.

ROMEO:
Look! Right there! Fred
Couples... and Ray Floyd!
Romeo notices that Tin Cup is staring at the pile of
practice balls lying there on the tee.

TIN CUP:
Look at these balls. Brand new
Titleists. Lookit 'em, every one
a brand new Titleist.
(lowers his voice)
Sneak a few in the bag when you
get a chance. We swipe enough
free shit we might even pay for
this fiasco.
Tin Cup limbers up, trying not to be in awe of the real
legends who line the practice range, hitting beautiful


                                Page 104/150

shot after beautiful shot with graceful ease.

ROMEO:
You think it would be
inappropriate to ask Ray Floyd for
an autograph?

TIN CUP:
I think it's a dead giveaway,
Romes... but if I still got the
shanks we're gonna be found out
real fast...
Tin Cup nudges a ball from the pile into address
position. Romeo hands him a different club.

ROMEO:
Hit the seven iron. You never
miss the seven...
92.

TIN CUP :
Good thought, Pods...
Tin Cup waggles, shakes, limbers, addresses...

TIN CUP :
Dollar bills...
And he swings.
THWOCK! A hideous shank squirrels across line, almost
hitting a group of U.S. Open officials. Heads turn.

TIN CUP :
(to anyone who'll
listen)
Who hit that shot? Anybody see?
He addresses another one. And swings.
THWOCK! A disaster. He crumbles.

ROMEO :
A little thin, Boss.

TIN CUP :
A little fucking thin?! I still
got the shanks! Everybody's
watching! Christ, Simms is here...


                                Page 105/150

Simms has arrived and is watching Tin Cup with delight as
he loosens up.

ROMEO :
Maybe we should work on putting.
Ya can't shank a putt.
Tin Cup pretends to limber a little more before daring to
strike another ball.

TIN CUP :
If you're the Mexican Mac O'Grady,
Romes, you gotta figure out why
I'm still shanking the ball.
(beat)
What's the problem? I'm catching
it on the hosel, right? Moving my
head? I'm laying off it, I'm
pronating, I'm supinating, I'm
clearing too early, I'm clearing
too late, I'm off plane, I ain't
dropping in -- oh, God, my swing
feels like an unfolding lawn chair.

ROMEO :
You got a virus in your brain. I

got to kill the brain to kill the
virus.

TIN CUP :
Anything. Kill me now!

ROMEO :
Put all your change in your right
pocket.
Tin Cup follows orders, not questioning the logic.

ROMEO :
Very good. Now tie your left
shoelace in a double knot.
Again, Tin Cup dutifully follows orders.

ROMEO :
Esta bueno. Now, turn your hat


                                 Page 106/150

around backwards and put a blue
tee behind your right ear...

TIN CUP :
I'll look like a fool.

ROMEO :
What you think you look like
hitting those squirrelly chili
peppers up Freddy Couples' ass,
eh? Do what I say or I quit.

TIN CUP :
Okay, okay...

ROMEO :
Perfect... now hit a seven iron
into that tree over there. You're
ready.
Tin Cup hits a perfect seven iron into the trees.

TIN CUP :
How'd I do that?

ROMEO :
You ain't thinking about shanking,
you ain't thinking about the
doctor lady, you ain't thinking
period. You just lookin' like a
fool and hittin' it pure -- your
natural state.

TIN CUP :
Fuck you.
94.

ROMEO :
You cured.

TIN CUP :
That's it?

ROMEO :
That's it. Your brain was getting


                                  Page 107/150

in the way.

TIN CUP :
That's rarely been a problem.
What now?

ROMEO :
Well, I should recommend you go
work on your short game but I
think it's better if you go get
drunk instead.

TIN CUP :
Get drunk?

ROMEO :
Yeah. You always play better when
you're wasted.
Tin Cups stares at the swami, and -

CUT TO:
92 INT. WINNEBAGO (IN PARKING LOT) - NIGHT 92
Again to GEORGE JONES on the CASSETTE PLAYER, Tin Cup is
doing a slow dance with his driver.
Romeo sits on the couch, stone cold sober, pouring drink
after drink for Tin Cup, who's thoroughly plastered.

TIN CUP :
It's three in the morning, Romes,
what time I tee off?

ROMEO :
Seven-o-five... first group off...
Keep drinking, keep dancing...

TIN CUP :
That's four hours from now?

ROMEO :
You're drinking till five...
c'mon, c'mon, have another -
(a tough coach)
Get you in shape -
95.


                                  Page 108/150

Tin Cup tosses down yet another drink, and staggersaround the room with his
driver until, finally, hecollapses in a heap on the floor. Romeo looks down

at him coolly, like horse trainer Wayne Lukas sizingup his Derby entry.

ROMEO :
Nothing like the sight of afinely-tuned athlete on the vergeof greatness...

Romeo tosses a blanket over Tin Cup lying on the floor.

With the honor in the 7:08

Mr. Roy McAvoy.
A half-dozen people clap, and -Tin
Cup and Romeo stagger to the tee, barely making it ontime. Tin Cup is
massively hung-over and unshaven.

TIN CUP :
No time for a bucket, eh?

ROMEO :
Almost missed the starting timetrying to get you off the floor,
boss. You don't handle the hooch
like you used to...
Tin Cup tries to get warm quickly, taking a few hurriedpractice swings. The
early tee times are strictly forthe longest of long shots, and almost
nobody is around.
Tin Cup's hand shakes as he closes the Velcro flap on hisglove. He's
wearing the hat and shirt with the sew-onpatches, as he stares down the
first fairway.
Romeo hands him a driver.
96.

ROMEO :


                                Page 109/150

I seen this hole on TV. Hit the
big dog down the chute --

TIN CUP :
No, I've learned my lesson. Gonna
play it safe, smart, conservative.
Fairways and greens. Hand me the
two iron.

ROMEO :
You sure?

Thought of the day is -- `be
humble.'
And Tin Cup launches a two iron down the first fairway.

Tin Cup stares, shell-shocked, as his score is posted.

ROMEO :
Eighty-three. Well, you humble
now.

TIN CUP :
Eleven bogeys and seven pars. I
didn't make a three. I didn't
make one goddam three all day.

ROMEO :
You weren't trying to make threes.
You were trying to avoid making
thirteen.

TIN CUP :
I was hungover!

ROMEO :
Maybe that was a coaching error on
my part.

David Simms is interviewed.
SIMMS (V.O.)
(on the television)
I'm the last person who expected
me to come out of the blocks with
a sixty-seven and lead the Open...
It's been a long time since I
played this game with the fire and
determination you need to win...

TIN CUP :
The Anti-Christ shoots 67, you
believe it?

ROMEO :
Ol' Anti-Christ got a hot
putter...
SIMMS (V.O.)
(on television)
... you see, this game is all
about integrity and tradition and
honor...

What? It's about cheating and
racism and bullshit!

ROMEO :
Easy, boss...

SIMMS:
(live on mike)
So tomorrow I'll just go out there
and try to make some good swings
and, Lord willing, maybe I can put
up another good number. Thank
you.

NANTZ :
Thank you, David Simms, a
brilliant opening round 67 to take
the lead.
Simms walks away, now off-camera. FANS call out -
98.

FANS:
David! David! Over here!

SIMMS :
Gotta go.
Simms cuts down behind the tent toward the clubhouse,
away from the galleries. The marshals open a rope
allowing him to avoid the crowds, but -
An ELDERLY COUPLE with a young child are there. The lady
has a tiny dog in her arms.

OLD MAN :
Excuse me, Mr. Simms!
(off no response)
Can you sign an autograph for our
grandson?

SIMMS:
(snaps)
Can't you see I'm busy?! I'm
working! This is my office! Do I
come to your office and ask you
for an autograph?! Jesus...
He practically stiff-arms them as he passes, heading up
to the clubhouse. They stand there in shock.

SIMMS :

Who the fuck these people think
they are...
CAMERA PANS OVER TO the edge of the tent. Molly, trying
to get to David, has seen the whole thing.

She speaks to herself.

MOLLY :
Old people, children, and dogs...

CUT TO:

Simms enters to numerous congratulations from officials,
caddies, other PLAYERS. Instantly, in public, he feigns
humility with convincing flair.
PLAYER #1
Helluva round, Dave!

SIMMS :
Got lucky out there...
PLAYER #2
Great start, Simmsy...
Simms stops when he sees Tin Cup and Romeo drowning their
sorrows.

SIMMS :
Hey, Tin Cup -- heard you put a
monster number up there...

TIN CUP :
Coulda been worse...
A small bar crowd is enjoying Simms' taunts.

SIMMS :
I played in the Pro-Am with some
asshole movie star shot 82 here
once... how did a great ball-
striker like you, a `legend,'
manage to shoot an 83?

TIN CUP :


                                   Page 113/150

I missed a four foot putt on the
eighteen for an 82, that's how...

SIMMS :
It ain't like playing some muni
track in Brownsville, is it?
A voice interrupts.

MOLLY :
Does, `integrity, tradition, and
honor' include kicking a man when
he's down?

SIMMS :
Oh, Mol', this is just guy stuff,
bar talk, part of the game -- no
offense, right, Cup?
No answer. Tin Cup's about as low as one can go.

SOME GUY AT THE BAR
(to Tin Cup)
You the guy shot 83?!

MOLLY :
David, I'll bet you a hundred
dollars right now that Roy here
can hit a ball -
(looks around)
-- from right here to... through
that door to the patio...
She points to a double door, forty feet away across, the
bar, about an 8 x 8 foot opening.

TIN CUP :
Molly, please...

MOLLY:
(to bartender)
And give me a vodka tonic with a
twist -

SIMMS :
Molly, really, this isn't...
dignified...

MOLLY :
Roy?

TIN CUP :
I wanta go back to Texas...

MOLLY :
What about the river, the piranha,
the immortality? All that
bullshit? You gonna drag your ass
home with an 83?
(looks around)
In fact, two hundred says he can
hit it through that door, over the
patio, into the river, and make
that pelican fly off that post.
Everyone strains to look -
POV - ABOUT 170 YARDS AWAY
A pelican sits on a piling in the river. Impossible.

BACK TO SCENE:

SIMMS :
This is ridiculous...
But Romeo's sizing it up.

ROMEO :
You got that shot, Pods, hood the
seven, turn it over, start it low,
right to left...
Molly takes a swig of her drink and slaps some money on

MOLLY :
I'm not leaving till one of you
men starts acting in a manly
fashion.
Simms puts a hundred dollar bill on the counter.

SIMMS :
Let's just get this over with.
One ball, one swing, one gull.

MOLLY :
Roy?
Tin Cup still sits, head half buried at the bar. He's
never passed up such an opportunity, but he's pretty low.

ROMEO :
You the man.
He turns from his bar stool, glances at the situation.

TIN CUP :
One swing? Four to one odds.

SIMMS :
I'll make it ten to one. Stick it
up your ass. I'm leading the
Open.

MOLLY :
Now we're talking! Manly men!
Whoas! From the barside gallery. Tin Cup rises and
someone hands him a club. Suddenly there's a crowd,
including Gary McCord who's been watching from the far
end of the bar. He grabs a seltzer hose as if it's a
mike and begins announcing.
McCORD
... He's looking at thirty yards
of bar and grill, an opening
through the French doors, forty
yards of patio umbrellas, a

hundred yards of water, and a
lonely pelican sitting out there

in a 15 mile an hour breeze, south
by southwest...
(beat)
He'll probably try to shut down a
four iron -- no, he's selected his
trusty seven iron...
Tin Cup steps up to a ball lying on the carpet.

TIN CUP :
Kind of a thin lie...

SIMMS:
Beats all that deep rough you were
in today...

ROMEO:
Fore in the grill! Fore on the
patio! You're the legend, boss...
Tin Cup suddenly backs off the swing and turns to Molly.

TIN CUP :
What is this all about?

MOLLY :
Shut up and hit the ball.
McCORD
(on ""mike"")
The Ledge still has to be thinking
about that brutal, ego-sapping,
manhood-robbing eighty-three he
buried himself under yesterday. I
mean, that's just an avalanche of
golf swings, a landslide, a
pyroclastic flow -

TIN CUP :
Dollar bills...
98
And he swings -- the ball rockets through the hall and 98
clears the open door...
The bettors pile from the bar and grill and race to the
patio to watch the flight of the ball, as -
It's carrying, it's hooking, it's carrying, then:
THWACK! -- It hits the piling! The SEAGULL lifts off,


                                Page 117/150

SCREECHING angrily.

ROMEO :
Stiff, baby, stiff!

SIMMS :
I'm outta here. You're all nuts.

MOLLY :
I musta been blind thinking youwere worth a shit, Simmsy!
(raucously)
Drinks on me, boys! Helluva shot,
Roy!

We hear Ben Wright's voice as Tin Cup marks his ball onthe green. A small
gallery has begun to follow him.
WRIGHT (V.O.)
If anyone was ever to make a runat what is the most storied number
in Open history, Miller's sixty-
three, it would be today when therain has softened the greens,
enabling the players to take deadaim at the flags. Still, the
unswerving courage of an unknowndriving range pro from Salome hasraised
that humble journeyman fromthe ashes of an ignominiouseighty-three to wave
a mighty fistat the pantheon of golf'simmortals. This man, this RoyMcAvoy
has laid siege to therecord book by birdieing the firstseven holes. A brave
par from thewater at eight, and a gloriousbirdie three at the
dauntingtwelfth, another at thirteen...
Tin Cup gets his read, and steps up to putt.

Tin Cup looks at the iron Romeo proffers. He looks back
at the shot, throws some grass in the air, testing the
wind. He looks at the gallery, the lake, the green, the
whole grand setting... and then:
He locates Molly behind the gallery ropes, watching. She
makes a little charging gesture with her fist. And:
Tin Cup reaches defiantly past Romeo and pulls out the
three wood.

water he could make seven or eight.
And he still has to think about
making the cut.

Laughter from the reporters. Reporter #1 follows up.

If you had to do it again, would

It's a water hazard. You go up

save par like you did yesterday.
Tin Cup's eyes blink with thought as Romeo's words get

TIN CUP :
You're right. What the hell was I
thinking?

A ball rolls past them and into a hole. Tin Cup looks
over and sees Simms.

SIMMS :
Sorry, Roy, can't believe I didn't
see you with all that high-priced
endorsement crap you're flaunting.

TIN CUP :
That's always been your problem,
Dave. You don't think about
winning; you just want to look
good.

Thing is, this ain't a beauty
pageant.

And Tin Cup moves to the tee.
His hand shakes worse than it did the first day as hetees his ball.
Stepping back to line up his shot, hepeers down the fairway through a
narrow corridor offaces. A daunting sight. He edges over to Romeo andtautly
whispers:

TIN CUP :
Do me a favor. Bet me a buck I

Okay, good.

Wright looks at the monitor where Tin Cup stands among
some trees.

BEN WRIGHT :
This is disaster for McAvoy.
After losing three shots to par inthe first four holes, he should
have just taken iron off the teeto get the ball in play. Does he
have any shot at all, Gary McCord?
132 EXT. FIFTH HOLE - DAY 132
Tin Cup's ball lies on dirt next to the trunk of a tree.
He surveys his options. Behind him, wearing a headset,
McCord analyzes the situation for the TV viewers.
120.
McCORD
This is definite jail. This is


                                Page 135/150

life without parole. His only
chance to stage a jail-break is go
at the ball left-handed and hope
he can somehow snake it back into
the fairway, and save par from
there.
Tin Cup glares balefully back at McCord. Then he walks
over to a nearby tree, and surveys the line to the green
from it. He walks back for his ball, turns to McCord...
and we see that familiar fierceness aflame in Tin Cup's
eyes.

TIN CUP:
Fifty bucks says I knock it on...
with a seven iron.
And he selects the seven iron, addresses the ball right- handed,

and:
He swings -- the ball rockets low off his club, and...
... it ricochets off the trunk of a nearby tree, and...
... it bounces up the fairway, skitters past a trap, and
trickles onto the green, stopping ten feet from the pin.
The gallery goes crazy as Tin Cup steps from the woods
collecting his money from McCord while jabbing a taunting
finger at Simms.
133 INT. TELEVISION TOWER 133
Nantz and Wright stare at the monitors.

NANTZ :
That took balls...
134 EXT. GOLF COURSE 134
Simms ignores Tin Cup's taunt, and lines up his shot.

SIMMS:
(to himself)
That's just Roy being Roy. Just
wait him out, Dave. Just make
pars. Let him make the mistakes.
And he hits his iron to the fat part of the green, and -
TIN CUP (O.S.)
Beauty, Dave. Par written all
over it.
121.
135 EXT. LEADER BOARD 135


                                Page 136/150

The scorer posts a -5 next to Tin Cup's name. Simms is
still at -7, and -

CUT TO:
136 EXT. GOLF COURSE - NINTH GREEN 136
Tin Cup intently follows the flight of his iron shot, as:
The ball lands near the front of the green, bounces, then
rolls, following the contour of the green. It finally
stops five feet from the pin.
A SWELLING, DEAFENING ROAR from the GALLERY accompanies
the unfolding shot, and -
137 EXT. TENTH TEE 137
Jacobsen looks toward the roar at the ninth green.

JACOBSEN :
He's making his run.
138 EXT. LEADER BOARD 138
The scorer posts a -6 next to Tin Cup's name. Simms is
still at -7.

CUT TO:
139 EXT. TENTH GREEN - DAY 139
Molly and Doreen watch Tin Cup drain a putt.

MOLLY :
(still watching
Tin Cup)
So why'd you leave him?

DOREEN:
You ever dated a guy who actually
believes in soul mates?

MOLLY :
Actually, no.

DOREEN:
He thinks he's a tough guy, but
he's a hopeless romantic.
122.
And as the gallery falls silent, she turns to watch Tin
Cup.

CUT TO:


                                Page 137/150

140 EXT. ELEVENTH GREEN - DAY 140
Tin Cup's firmly-struck putt spins out of the hole. The
GALLERY GROANS, sharing his agony, and -
141 EXT. TWELFTH TEE 141
Jacobsen, pausing to watch, sighs with relief before
starting down the fairway.

CUT TO:
142 EXT. THIRTEENTH HOLE - DAY 142
Tin Cup follows the flight of his approach, and up ahead

on:
143 EXT. FOURTEENTH TEE - DAY 143
Peter Jacobsen hears the GALLERY ROAR. He turns to his
caddie, incredulous.

JACOBSEN:
He's throwing darts back there.
We gotta make birdies, Squeaky, or
we are playing for second.
And he snatches his driver from the bag, determined to
make birdies.

CUT TO:
144 EXT. LEADER BOARD 144
The scorer posts -7 next to Tin Cup's name. Simms is
still at -7, as is Jacobsen. And...
145 EXT. FOURTEENTH GREEN - DAY 145
Jacobsen rolls a long putt into the hole, and as the
GALLERY CHEERS, he points a finger of challenge back at -
Tin Cup waiting in the fairway. Tin Cup seems to enjoy
the taunt.

TIN CUP:
That's right, Peter. You'n me.
That's all there is.
123.
And he selects a club, and...

CUT TO:
146 INT. DRIVING RANGE (SALOME) - DAY
Tin Cup's fans, deeply into the beer by now, contort withbody-english and
holler at the TV screen.




                                 Page 138/150

FANS :
Get in there! Come on! Go down!
146
They explode with cheers. Some twirl with glee. Others
exchange high fives.

EARL :
He's tied for the lead again! And
they're running outta holes!

CUT TO:
147 EXT. TELEVISION TOWER - DAY 147
The leader board is superimposed on the monitor.
-8, Jacobsen -8, Simms -7.
McAvoy

NANTZ :
So it's come down to the seventy-
second hole of this greatchampionship, and the skill andcourage of three
Texans who havedueled throughout the day for thechance to be crowned
OpenChampion... Peter Jacobsen is onthe fairway at 8 under, McAvoy atthe
18th tee is tied at minus 8,
and David Simms trails by one...
148 EXT. EIGHTEENTH TEE 148
Tin Cup and Romeo watch Jacobsen hit his shot.

TIN CUP :
Jacobsen's laying up.
(turning to Simms)
You ain't gonna have that luxury,
Dave. Not if you play to win.
He moves to the tee, and...

CUT TO:
124.
149 EXT. TELEVISION TOWER 149
The monitor shows Tin Cup's drive bounding down themiddle of the fairway.

NANTZ :
McAvoy's hit a perfect drive, Ken.

VENTURI :
I'm not sure that's good news forMcAvoy. With his inexperience,
the last thing he needs is anexcuse to fool with that water


                                Page 139/150

again today.
150 BACK TO TEE 150
Tin Cup whispers to Romeo as Simms tees up.

TIN CUP :
I didn't catch it all.

ROMEO :
Then you got to lay up.
Simms rips a drive down the middle, the ball landinga little short of
Roy's.
151 EXT. EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY - DAY 151
Tin Cup in the fairway, studying his shot.

TIN CUP :
So birdie wins it.
He looks at Simms, ten yards across the fairway from him.

TIN CUP :
You or me, Dave?
Simms points to himself. He has a wood in his hands, but
he puts the club back and reaches for an iron. Tin Cupedges closer to
Romeo.

TIN CUP :
(whispering)
He's laying up. Birdie to tie,
eagle to win, and that gutlesswonder's laying up.

ROMEO :
(whispering)
Par to tie, birdie to win... youlay up too, Roy. You can make
birdie laying up.
125.
They watch Simms lay up. Then Romeo offers Tin Cup an
iron, hoping he'll take it.

TIN CUP :
You know something, Romeo? Eagle
puts me ten under. No one's ever
finished an Open ten under, not
even Nicklaus.

ROMEO :


                                   Page 140/150

You don't need an eagle. Birdie
wins, par ties.
(firmly)
Hit the lay up. Hole a wedge for
goddamn eagle.
Tin Cup throws some grass in the air, looks back at the
green, the gallery, the whole grand setting... and he
seeks out Molly's face in the crowd. He moves over so
she can hear him.

TIN CUP :
This is everything, ain't it?
This is the choice it comes down
to. This is our immortality...

ROMEO :
No time to be thinkin'
'immortality,' Cup... time to be
thinkin' 7 iron.
Molly stands with Doreen, hearing Tin Cup's words.
Thrilled and terrified and spellbound, she finds herself
nodding. Doreen, on the other is turning ash-white.

DOREEN :
Oh no. This is what always
happens. He's going for it.

MOLLY :
Go for it!

DOREEN :
No! He just needs par to tie!
Tell him to lay up! He listens to
you!

MOLLY :
Go for it, Roy! Knock it on!

DOREEN :
This is why we split up -- he
always went for it...

MOLLY :
My problem is I've never been with


                                   Page 141/150

126.
a man who went for it...

DOREEN :
Well, honey, he's your guy.
BACK TO TIN CUP
He selects the three wood. Romeo sighs.
152 EXT. TELEVISION TOWER - DAY 152

NANTZ :
Good Lord, he's going for the
green.

VENTURI :
This could be tragic.
153 EXT. EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY 153
Tin Cup's eyes focus with the look of eagles as headdresses the shot.

TIN CUP :
One swing, Roy. One good swing.
Dollar bills...
He swings -- the ball explodes off his club.
holds the pose...

TIN CUP :
We're home...
Tin Cup
Suddenly a gust of wind blows, out of nowhere, and TinCup's cap blows off,
provoking immediate concern.

TIN CUP :
... little gust there, Romes...
154 TELEVISION MONITOR 154
Picking up the flight of the ball approaching the green,
carried it seems by the swelling roar of the gallery.
The ball clears the water...
... and lands at the top of the slope fronting theelevated green. It pops
up in the air, lands just pastwhere it hit, and comes momentarily to rest.
The gallery

roars. And then:
The ball starts trickling back down the slope, gainingspeed, moving towards
the water, even as the galleryscreams for it to stop...
127.


                                Page 142/150

... until finally it disappears into the water withscarcely a ripple.
155 BACK TO TIN CUP 155
He stares first with betrayal, then with anger, andlooks at Romeo, who just
shrugs, then at Molly.

MOLLY :
You can still make par from upthere -ROMEO
She's right, Pods, a drop and astroke, up and down par -- we'llwin it in
sudden death.
But Tin Cup still has the look of eagles. He's staringat the shot he just
made, still holding the three wood.

TIN CUP :
I nutted that thing. Little gustfrom the gods cost me...

ROMEO :
Helluva move you put on thatsucker, now let's get up there,
take the drop, and make our par,
tie Peter...

TIN CUP :
I can make this shot.
Not now.

ROMEO :
Now.

TIN CUP :
Tin Cup throws another ball on the ground.

TIN CUP :
I'm playing it from here.

MOLLY :
Take your drop and make your par!
Tin Cup addresses the ball.

CUT TO:
156 EXT. TELEVISION TOWER 156
Venturi nearly comes out of seat watching Tin Cup take a
128.
drop from his original lie.

VENTURI :


                                Page 143/150

I don't believe this. He just
took himself out of the tournament
with that drop. He could have
walked up to the hazard line,
saved par with a wedge and forced
a playoff with Jacobsen. Now he
needs a miracle shot.
McCORD (V.O.)
Ken, I'm right behind McAvoy here.
And all he said to his caddie was:
I can make it across.
157
EXT. EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY - DAY 157
Tin Cup swings again -- The ball sails long and true once
again, and once again...
158
... it lands into the hill, bounces once, and trickles 158
back into the water.
VENTURI (V.O.)
Oh, my. This is tragic.
159
BACK TO TIN CUP 159
Holding his hand out to Romeo, as the gallery murmurs
uncomfortably.

TIN CUP :
Gimme another ball.
BACK TO DOREEN AND MOLLY
watching behind the ropes.

MOLLY :
I can't believe he's doing this.

DOREEN :
(unfazed)
I can, honey...

MOLLY :
He can blow the whole tournament!

DOREEN :
It's a miracle he lasted this
long...
129.

waiting at the green, amidst the rest of the gallery
who's in shock about Tin Cup's decisions to keep going
for it, keep trying to prove a point.

CLINT :
He done blew a gasket, boys...

EARL :
The wheels is definitely falling
off now...

JOSE :
It was a miracle while it
lasted...
REGULARS' POV
Tin Cup swings a third time.

CUT TO:
161
EXT. EIGHTEENTH GREEN - DAY 161
A BALL lands SPLOOSH! in the WATER, and...
162
BACK UP FAIRWAY 162
Tin Cup holds out his hand for yet another ball, saying
nothing.
Romeo hands him another ball.
Tin Cup unloads another 3-wood. Another splash.
Tin Cup holds out his hand again.

ROMEO :
This is your last ball, man. If
this gets wet, you disqualified.

TIN CUP :
I can make it across.
Tin Cup snatches the ball from Romeo's hand.
163
EXT. TELEVISION TOWER 163
Venturi and Nantz can barely look at the monitor.
130.


                                   Page 145/150

VENTURI :
This is the most painful thing
I've ever watched.
McCORD (V.O.)
Jim, this is the last ball he has
in his bag. If he doesn't finish
the hole with it, he can't turn in
a card. He'll be disqualified.
Venturi and Nantz cover their eyes.
Tin Cup unloads another three wood -- another splash.
164
BACK TO TIN CUP 164
He looks at Molly.

CLOSE ON MOLLY :
She's just laughing.
Romeo tosses down another ball -- Tin Cup launches
his fifth attempt to clear the pond. Splash.

MOLLY :
You're right, Roy, what the hell!
Let 'er rip!

DOREEN:
You two are made for each other.
BACK TO TIN CUP
This is still all business to him. He sets his jaw,
addresses the shot, and:

TIN CUP :
Dollar bills...
He swings -- another perfect shot... but this time the
wind relents a knot, and:
165 BALL 165
clears the water, clears the slope, hits the front of the
green, rolls up toward the pin, and drops in the hole.
The gallery goes berserk!
166 BACK TO TIN CUP 166
Raising his three wood aloft in triumph, he looks over at
Molly and finally cracks a smile.
131.

166 CONTINUED:


                                Page 146/150

And when she smiles back, he takes his hat off and walks
to the green, to as great an ovation as the game has ever
heard.

CUT TO:
167 BACK IN TELEVISION TOWER 167
Venturi and Nantz slump, drained, over their monitors.

CUT TO:
168 INT. SCORER'S TENT - DAY 168
Tin Cup and Simms sign their cards and get up to leave in
unison. Simms turns to Tin Cup and has to shake his
head.

SIMMS :
I gotta hand it to you, Roy. When
you go down, you go down in
flames.

TIN CUP :
Someday you can tell your
grandchildren you finished second
in the U.S. Open...
(beat)
-- just don't tell 'em how.
And he moves brusquely past Simms and out of the tent,
congratulating Tubbs, the winner, as he passes.

TIN CUP :
Good job, Tubbsy... you won it.
And out of the scorer's tent...
169 EXT. SCORER'S TENT 169
A roar goes up from the milling fans as Tin Cup emerges.
He tries to smile, but it's all dawning on him.

TIN CUP :
My God... I just gave away the
Open...
And then McCord is there, shoving a mike in Tin Cup's
face.
132.
McCORD
Ledge, I know it's tough to talk
right now, but -


                                Page 147/150

TIN CUP:
It's not difficult to talk... it's
difficult to explain... I coulda
laid up and still won. I made a
twelve on the last hole of the U.S.
Open. You know how much money
that cost me?
McCORD
Cost you a bundle...

TIN CUP :
I gotta get outta here.
McCORD
It was the greatest 12 I ever saw.
Back to you, Jim...
Tin Cup exits the scorers' tent and runs into the
regulars -- They're beaming, undyingly loyal.

CLINT AND EARL:
Greatest 12 I ever saw... you
crunched that dog, baby...
gorgeous shot, etc...
He looks up and there's Molly -- He stops short. They
embrace.

TIN CUP:
Molly, I'm an idiot. I gave away
the Open. The one time in my life
I know the play is to hit the lay
up -- my whole life and future
and career on the line, and I
still can't make myself do it. I
am a twisted human being and a
cautionary tale. And I guess I'm
a fool?

MOLLY :
Yes. A magnificent fool...

Romeo and Doreen eye each other -- locked in a stareof longing and mystery.
TANGO MUSIC comes from a

CUT TO:
170 EXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT 170
Tin Cup and Molly are sitting, feet up, a couple LoneStar beers beside
them, just taking in the warm Texasnight. Her head rests on his shoulder.
The world at
peace.

TIN CUP :
Some people don't like West Texasbut I think it's the most
beautiful place on earth...

MOLLY :
It has its charms...
(beat)
Y'know, by finishing in the top 15at the Open you qualified to be init next
year -TIN

CUP :
Damn, I didn't know that...

MOLLY :
I'm thinking with your game youshould go back to the QualifyingSchool, try
to get out on tour...

TIN CUP :
Then I wouldn't see you...

MOLLY :
Actually, I picked up a wholebunch of new clients at the Open.
Lotta guys on the tour said if Icould do that much for you,
imagine what I could do forthem...

TIN CUP :
There's a lotta head cases out
there, you could make a bundle...




                                Page 149/150

MOLLY :
And sleep in the Winnebago atnight...
134.
Silence.

TIN CUP :
Y'know... a man goes through what
I've gone through, he's supposed
to learn something.
(beat)
I'm trying to figure out what I
learned. Did I learn anything?

MOLLY :
You're learning some discipline and
self-control...

TIN CUP :
And that there's a time in life to
play it safe...

MOLLY :
That's great, Roy... and I'm learning
how to listen to the tuning fork,
throw caution to the wind, and take
crazy risks I never thought were
possible...

TIN CUP :
C'mon, Molly, when did you ever take
a crazy risk?

MOLLY :
I fell for you...

A desolate driving range outside of Salome, Texas. Bugs,

I was still eating smushed peas and        *
bananas when Mom died. I have no           *
idea what her Bo-Ssam tasted like.         *

          LARA JEAN                        *
Come on, Kitty. Do it for dad.             *

          KITTY                            *
Maybe if we didn’t all pretend we          *
loved his attempts at Korean food          *
so much we wouldn’t have to eat it         *
on every special occasion. What’s a        *
girl gotta do to get a                     *
cheeseburger?                              *

          MARGOT                           *
He doesn’t want us to lose touch           *
with our roots. It’s sweet.                *

          JOSH                             *
I love your dad’s cooking.                 *

           LARA JEAN                       *
Your opinion doesn’t count. I once         *
saw you eat a hot dog out of a             *
trash can.                                 *

          MARGOT                           *
Is that true?                              *

          JOSH                             *
It was from the tray on top of a           *
trash can and it was Lara Jean’s           *
leftovers. Not some stranger’s.            *

          LARA JEAN                        *
Still. It’d crossed into the               *
threshold of trash.                        *

          MARGOT                           *
Gross.                                     *

          JOSH                             *
    (to Lara Jean)                         *
Way to sell me out, by the way.            *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                  3.


Lara Jean smiles, shrugs and goes back to her book.              *

                    DR. COVEY (O.C.)                             *
          We’re ready!                                           *

The sisters give each other “here we go” looks.                  *


INT. COVEY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - SAME                            *

Everyone sits around the table. DR. COVEY, 50’s, white, an OB-   *
GYN, trying his best to raise three daughters on his own,        *
serves a VERY BURNT (and not in the right way) PORK SHOULDER.    *
He struggles to cut it.                                          *

                    LARA JEAN                                    *
              (whispers to Margot)                               *
          It’s suppose to fall off the bone.                     *
          That’s like a rubber chicken.                          *

                    MARGOT                                       *
          Shh.                                                   *

                    DR. COVEY                                    *
          I ran out of time to make the kim-                     *
          chi so that’s store bought, sorry                      *
          girls.                                                 *

The girls secretly smile. Dr. Covey passes a plate to Margot.    *

                    DR. COVEY (CONT’D)                           *
          I can’t believe this is your last                      *
          night at home, kiddo. We’re just                       *
          gonna miss you so damn much.                           *

Josh squeezes Margot’s hand.                                     *

                    JOSH                                         *
          We sure are.                                           *

Margot politely pulls her hand away.                             *

                    KITTY                                        *
          I can’t believe we’re not gonna see                    *
          you until Thanksgiving.                                *

                    MARGOT                                       *
          Christmas, actually. Scotland is                       *
          too far to come back for                               *
          Thanksgiving.                                          *

                    LARA JEAN                                    *
          Wait. Are you kidding? We won’t see                    *
          you til Christmas! That’s so long!                     *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                  4.

              (gentle ribbing)                                  *
          It’ll fly by. Also with three                         *
          months to practice maybe you’ll be                    *
          a passable driver by the time I get                   *
          home.                                                 *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Rude. I’m passable now. Ish.                          *

                    KITTY                                       *
          Yeah, right. I’m gonna start                          *
          wearing my bike helmet to school                      *
          now that you’re the one driving me.                   *

          Not a bad idea.                                       *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Hey!                                                  *

                    JOSH                                        *
          Speaking of Thanksgiving -                            *

                    KITTY                                       *
          Thanksgiving was two topics ago.                      *
          Now we’re talking about what a bad                    *
          driver Lara Jean is -                                 *

                    JOSH                                        *
              (pushing forward)                                 *
          I have a surprise.                                    *

He pulls a PRINT-OUT of an AIRLINE TICKET CONFIRMATION out of   *
his pocket, hands it to Margot.                                 *

                    JOSH (CONT’D)                               *
          Since you can’t come home. I                          *
          thought I’d bring a little bit of                     *
          home to you.                                          *

Margot stares at the print out. She’s not saying anything.      *

                     JOSH (CONT’D)                              *
          It’s a plane ticket! I’m coming to                    *
          Scotland!!                                            *

                    DR. COVEY                                   *
          Wow! So cool. Margot isn’t that                       *
          great?                                                *

                    MARGOT                                      *
          You already paid for this?                            *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                     5.


                    JOSH                                         *
          Well, yeah. I booked it early so I                     *
          could get a good rate.                                 *

                    MARGOT                                       *
          You really should have talked to me                    *
          before doing this.                                     *

                    JOSH                                         *
          I wanted it to be a surprise.                          *
          What’s the matter? You want me to                      *
          come, don’t you?                                       *

                    MARGOT                                       *
              (intense)                                          *
          I. I don’t know. You can’t just                        *
          spring this on me!                                     *

The family is shocked. No one is used to seeing Margot lose      *
her cool. Josh is visibly wounded.                               *

                    JOSH                                         *
              (softly)                                           *
          I guess I thought you’d be happy.                      *

Awkward beat. Everyone silently stares at their plates. Lara     *
Jean looks at Margot, trying to gauge what’s going on.           *

In an attempt to break the tension, Kitty takes a huge bite      *
of pork and yells -                                              *

                    KITTY                                        *
          Mmmmm, just like Mom’s!                                *

As everyone turns to look at Kitty, Josh gets up from the        *
table and leaves.                                                *


INT. LARA JEAN’S BEDROOM - LATER

Lara Jean stares out her window. She’s spying on Margot and
Josh who are arguing in the space between their two houses.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          I guess I should back up and tell
          you a little about Josh. He lives
          next door to us and he and Margot
          have been a couple for the past two
          years. But before Margot even knew
          or cared that he existed. He was my
          first boy friend.

FLASHBACK -

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                   6.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Middle school versions of Lara Jean and Josh ride bikes
around the neighborhood. Lara Jean has braces.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          Space between the words. Boy who
          was a friend. We used to ride our
          bikes everywhere.

They jump over puddles and race down the street.


INT. MOVIE THEATER - EVENING

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          We liked all the same gory horror
          movies.

Josh and Lara Jean both scream and their popcorn goes flying
into the air.


EXT. SCHOOL BLEACHERS - DAY                                    *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          And we’d talk about everything.
          Even weird stuff.

They eat their lunch on the empty bleachers at school -        *

                    LARA JEAN
          Would you rather only drink water
          for the rest of your life? Or, be
          allowed to drink anything you want
          but it all has a drop of pee in it?

                    JOSH
          Is it clean pee?

                    LARA JEAN
          Yes. It’s just one drop of clean,
          disease free pee.

                    JOSH
              (seriously considering)
          Clear or Yellow?

                    LARA JEAN
          Gotta be at least a little yellow.

                    JOSH
          Pee. Definitely pee.
              (explaining)
                    (MORE)

                       Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 7.

                    JOSH (CONT'D)
          I don’t think I can give up
          Mountain Dew. Plus side, it’s
          yellow anyway so you wouldn’t even
          notice.

                    LARA JEAN
          Haha, Sicko.

                    JOSH
          Come on you know you choose pee
          too.

                     LARA JEAN
          Oh yeah, definitely. Pee’s the only
          way to go.

They both laugh.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          It’s not that we stopped being
          friends when Josh and Margot got
          together. It was just different.


INT. MARGOT’S CAR

Margot drives. Josh is in front and Lara Jean is in the back.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          Margot had her license so we didn’t
          need to ride our bikes anymore.


EXT. BLEACHERS -                                                *

Margot, Josh and Lara Jean eat their lunch on the bleachers.    *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          And Josh was different too...

                    MARGOT
              (grossed out)
          Water. Definitely water.

                    JOSH
          Yeah, me too. Definitely.


INT. MOVIE THEATER -

          They didn’t want me to feel left
          out so they invited me everywhere,
          even on dates.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                     8.


Lara Jean looks around the movie theater, all the other
teenage couples are sucking face hard.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          They tried to make it as normal as
          possible...

She looks over at Josh and Margot who, in contrast to the
others, are very politely watching the screen.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          But I still felt like a third
          wheel.

She looks down and sees they are HOLDING HANDS.                  *


INT. LARA JEAN’S BEDROOM - LAST SUMMER                           *

We see Lara Jean spying on Margot and Josh out her bedroom       *
window. They are MAKING OUT.                                     *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)                             *
          It’s not that I wasn’t happy for                       *
          them or wanted them to break-up or                     *
          anything. But I missed my friend.                      *
          And so...I did this thing I do,                        *
          where when I’m trying to figure out                    *
          what my feelings for someone, I                        *
          write them a letter.                                   *
              (small beat)                                       *
          I guess you could call it a love                       *
          letter.                                                *

She goes over to her desk and we see her writing, “DEAR          *
JOSH...”                                                         *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)                             *
          It wasn’t a letter to send. It was                     *
          just for me. To understand why I                       *
          felt the way I did. How could you                      *
          miss someone you saw all the time?                     *
          And sometimes...                                       *

We see the words as she writes them: “I WONDER WHAT IT WOULD     *
HAVE BEEN LIKE...                                                *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)                             *
          ...I wondered what it would have                       *
          been like if I’d realized how I                        *
          felt about him sooner.                                 *

BACK TO PRESENT -                                                *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                  9.


INT. LARA JEAN’S BEDROOM                                        *

Lara Jean watches Josh and Margot from her window. They are     *
standing in the same spot between their houses where we saw     *
them making out in the flashback. But this time, they are       *
definitely not making out. In fact, Josh might be crying.       *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)                            *
          But that’s all ancient history.                       *

Lara Jean walks over to her closet. She takes a LARGE, TEAL     *
HAT BOX down from the top shelf. She opens it. We see FIVE      *
ENVELOPES. She FLIPS THROUGH THEM.                              *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)                            *
          I have five letters total. Each to                    *
          a different boy. I keep them in a                     *
          vintage hat box my mom gave me                        *
          before she died. No one knows about                   *
          them. But sometimes, alone in my                      *
          room, I like to re-read them. The                     *
          letters remind me how powerful my                     *
          emotions can be. How all consuming.                   *
          Margot would say I’m being                            *
          dramatic. But I think drama can be                    *
          fun. Just so long as no one else                      *
          knows about it.                                       *

                    MARGOT (O.C.)                               *
          What are you doing?                                   *

Lara Jean jumps and hides the hat box in her closet.            *

                     LARA JEAN                                  *
          Nothing.                                              *

Margot comes into Lara Jean’s room, lays down on her bed. She   *
looks exhausted.                                                *

                    MARGOT                                      *
          Your room is a mess.                                  *

Lara Jean looks around. It is in fact a mess.                   *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Are you okay?                                         *

                    MARGOT                                      *
          Yes. No. I don’t know. I just broke                   *
          up with Josh.                                         *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          You did what?? Why?                                   *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 10.


Margot looks over to a framed photo of herself (age 10), Lara   *
Jean (age 8) and Kitty (almost 3) with their MOTHER, EVE SONG   *
COVEY, before she died.                                         *

                    MARGOT                                      *
          Mom told me that you should never                     *
          go to college with a boyfriend.                       *

Lara Jean goes and gets in bed with Margot. Margot leans her    *
head on Lara Jean’s shoulder.                                   *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          But you love Josh.                                    *

                    MARGOT                                      *
          I know.                                               *

                     LARA JEAN                                  *
          So, do you think you might change                     *
          your mind?                                            *

                    MARGOT                                      *
          No. It’s over.                                        *

Margot gets up. Like she’s decided that’s enough and they       *
don’t need to talk about her and Josh anymore.                  *

                    MARGOT (CONT’D)                             *
          When I was packing for college I                      *
          made a pile of stuff I don’t need                     *
          anymore and asked Daddy to take it                    *
          to Goodwill. You should make a pile                   *
          too. It really is a mess in here.                     *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          I don’t think there’s anything I                      *
          can really part with right now.                       *

Margot picks up a BROKEN, PLASTIC POT HOLDER LOOM.              *

                    MARGOT                                      *
          So you’re currently using this                        *
          broken pot-holder loom from fourth                    *
          grade?                                                *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          I was thinking of getting into                        *
          making wall hangings.                                 *

          I’m leaving tomorrow. Lara Jean.                      *
          That means you’re gonna be the                        *
          biggest sister.                                       *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                  11.

                    MARGOT (CONT'D)
          You need to set a good example for                   *
          Kitty.                                               *
              (small beat)                                     *
          Tell you what? How bout I go get                     *
          those boxes and help you? Fresh                      *
          start to the year.                                   *
              (re: loom)                                       *
          We can start with this.                              *

Margot exits with the loom. Lara Jean calls after her.         *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          I was planning on making you a wall                  *
          hanging for your dorm, you know!                     *

                    MARGOT                                     *
              (over her shoulder)                              *
          I think I’ll survive.                                *


INT. COVEY HOUSE - FOYER - MORNING                             *

We see a BIG PILE OF BOXES by the door marked GOODWILL. Next   *
to two perfectly packed suitcases that say, MARGOT COLLEGE.    *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)                           *
          Margot says that when something is                   *
          no longer useful, you either donate                  *
          it, recycle it or throw it away.                     *


EXT. COVEY HOUSE - SAME                                        *

Dr. Covey loads the boxes and Margot’s suitcases into the      *
trunk of his Volvo.                                            *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)                           *
          I always knew she felt that way                      *
          about objects.                                       *

We see Josh watching the family from his window.               *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)                           *
          But I didn’t think she could feel                    *
          that way about a person too.                         *

Lara Jean looks up at him. He disappears behind the curtain.   *


EXT. AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING - MORNING                          *

We see Dr. Covey’s Volvo pulls up in front of the DEPARTURES   *
GATE.                                                          *

INT. AIRPORT - SAME                                             *

Dr. Covey and Kitty both hug Margot. Lara Jean hugs her last.   *
Dr. Covey senses they need a moment.                            *

                    DR. COVEY                                   *
          Come on, Kitty. Let’s go buy Margot                   *
          a magazine for the plane.                             *

They walk off.                                                  *

                    MARGOT                                      *
          Are you gonna be okay? School?                        *
          Taking care of things around the                      *
          house? Driving?                                       *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Don’t worry about me. I got this.                     *

Lara Jean smiles a BIG FAKE SMILE.                              *

                    MARGOT                                      *
          Do you really have this or are you                    *
          doing that thing you do where you                     *
          pretend you’re okay when you’re                       *
          not.                                                  *

          You can lie to your father and you                    *
          can lie to your friends. But you                      *
          can’t -                                               *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          - lie to you sister. I know. It’s                     *
          super annoying.                                       *

Margot looks at Lara Jean. She hasn’t answered her question.    *

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)                          *
          I will be okay.                                       *

                    MARGOT                                      *
          Do me a favor. Try and hang out                       *
          with more than just Christine this                    *
          year. Okay?                                           *

          What are you talking about?                           *

             Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)        13.


          MARGOT                            *
    (not sure how to say it)                *
Sometimes I worry you don’t have            *
enough people in your life.                 *

          LARA JEAN                         *
That’s crazy. I have tons of                *
people.                                     *

          MARGOT                            *
Me, Daddy, Kitty, Christine. That’s         *
it.                                         *

            LARA JEAN                       *
And Josh.                                   *

          MARGOT                            *
Do you really think you’ll still be         *
hanging out with my ex-boyfriend            *
after I leave for college?                  *

          LARA JEAN                         *
I ate lunch with the two of you             *
everyday last year. What am I               *
supposed to do? Eat lunch alone.            *

          MARGOT                            *
That’s what I’m talking about. Even         *
if we add Josh that’s still only            *
what - six people? And I won’t even         *
be here.                                    *

          LARA JEAN                         *
    (losing it a little)                    *
Exactly. You know what happens when         *
you let people into your life. They         *
either leave or they die.                   *
    (small beat then softer)                *
So excuse me for not wanting to put         *
myself through more of that.                *

          MARGOT                            *
    (quietly, an apology)                   *
I have to go to college, Lara Jean.         *

          LARA JEAN                         *
    (what’s really wrong)                   *
I know. It’s just. It’s gonna be so         *
weird not having you around this            *
year. Did you have to pick the              *
farthest college you could possibly         *
think of?                                   *

                        Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)               14.

          Hey. If you need me, I’m only a                      *
          skype away.                                          *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          Til you start going to pubs and                      *
          eating haggis with your new                          *
          Scottish friends and forget about                    *
          us.                                                  *

                    MARGOT                                     *
          I can promise you...I will never                     *
          eat haggis.                                          *

They both smile. They really love one another. Dr. Covey and   *
Kitty come back holding a HUGE STACK OF MAGAZINE.              *

                    KITTY                                      *
          We couldn’t decide so we got you                     *
          all of them.                                         *


INT. AIRPORT - LATER

Dr. Covey puts his arms around Lara Jean and Kitty as they
watch Margot walk up the stairs to go through security,        *
holding the huge pile of magazines.                            *

                    KITTY
          Think she’ll turn back around??

                       LARA JEAN
          No.

They keep watching as she confidently shows her passport and
ticket. She doesn’t turn around.

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
          That’s not Margot.                                   *


EXT. COVEY HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY - MORNING                      *

Dr. Covey takes a photo of Lara Jean and Kitty in front of     *
the house.                                                     *

                    DR. COVEY                                  *
          Fourth grade and Junior year! I                      *
          can’t believe it. Smile!                             *

The girls humor their father and smile.                        *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          You ready to go, Kitty?                              *

                        Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                15.


                       KITTY                                    *
          One sec.                                              *

Kitty runs into the house and returns wearing her bike          *
helmet.                                                         *

                       KITTY (CONT’D)                           *
          All set.                                              *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Very funny.                                           *

                    KITTY                                       *
          Very necessary.                                       *


INT. ADLER HIGHSCHOOL - HALLWAYS                                *

Lara Jean walks down the center of the hallway, alone. On       *
either side of her we see students hugging, asking each other   *
about their summers, comparing course schedules.                *

Across the hall, Lara Jean sees Josh putting his books in his   *
locker. She waves. He waves back. Both unsure what their        *
relationship is supposed to look like now that Margot is        *
gone.                                                           *

Blushing but not sure why, Lara Jean turns and not looking      *
where she’s going she walks directly into GEN, 16, blonde,      *
intimidatingly pretty. The kind of girl who gets off on
people being afraid of her.

                    GEN
          Ow! Watch where you’re going much?

                    LARA JEAN
          Oh my god, Gen! I’m so sorry. I
          wasn’t paying attention...

                       GEN
          Obviously.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          Gen. Genevieve. Someone who treated
          me like an old pot holder loom and
          recycled our friendship as soon as
          we left middle school and I stopped
          being cool enough for her.

Genevieve holds her foot, pouting. Her boyfriend, PETER         *
KAVINSKY, 17, so confidant you want to hate him but can’t
because he’s so cute, walks up. He’s that guy from high         *
school.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 16.


                    PETER
              (to Gen)
           Sup with your foot?

                    GEN
              (to Peter)
          I think she broke my toe with those
          witch shoes.

She looks down at Lara Jean’s VINTAGE BOOTIES.

                    GEN (CONT’D)
              (to Lara Jean)
          Where’d you get those anyway,
          Halloween adventure?

                    LARA JEAN
          They’re vintage. I found them on
          Etsy.

                    GEN
          They’re ridiculous.

CHRISTINE, 17, cool, over high school and doesn’t give a shit   *
what anyone thinks of her, walks up. She puts her arm around    *
Lara Jean.                                                      *

                    CHRISTINE
          Actually, they’re amazing.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          Christine. Chris. Gen’s cousin. My
          best friend. My only friend,                          *
          really.                                               *

                    CHRISTINE
              (to Gen)
          But shoes so dope are really hard
          to pull off. Lara Jean can rock em,
          natch, but for you Cuz...Well,
          let’s just say it’s probably a good
          thing you’re playing it safe with
          those Uggs.

That was clearly not a compliment and Gen knows it.

                    GEN
              (to Peter)
          Do you smell that?                                    *

                    PETER                                       *
          No. I don’t smell anything.                           *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 17.


                     GEN                                        *
          You do. It’s like, an old person                      *
          foot smell. It’s making me wanna                      *
          vom.                                                  *
               (to Lara Jean re: shoes)                         *
          You know you can catch toenail                        *
          fungus from used shoes, right?                        *
          Better be careful. Athlete’s foot                     *
          is no joke. Come on, Peter.                           *

Peter and Gen walk off.

                    CHRIS                                       *
          Ignore her. You can’t catch toenail                   *
          fungus from Etsy. And if anything                     *
          smelled it was his Axe Body Spray.                    *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Thanks but be honest, do they                         *
          really look like I got them at
          Halloween adventure?

                    CHRISTINE
          Kind of. But in a hot way. Like
          Kendall Jenner meets Morticia
          Adams.

                    LARA JEAN
          That’s what I think! Ugh. Your
          cousin is such a bitch.

                    CHRISTINE
          And you’re just realizing this now?                   *

Lara Jean smiles. The bell rings.                               *


INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH TIME                                     *

Lara Jean walks into the cafeteria and looks around the room.   *
Gen and Peter are holding court at their table. Last year she   *
would have been sitting with Josh and Margot. She texts         *
Chris. We see their exchange.                                   *

LJ: WHERE R U??                                                 *

CHRIS: SUBWAY!! SWEET ONION CHX TERIYAKI TIME YO! KYLE PICKED   *
ME UP. C U IN GYM.                                              *

LJ: Who’s Kyle?                                                 *

No response.                                                    *

                        Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)               18.


INT. LIBRARY - A FEW MINUTES LATER                               *

Lara Jean walks into the library. She sees a group of            *
students sitting at a long table silently eating their           *
lunches and studying. She sits down, takes out her ROMANCE       *
NOVEL and starts reading. A boy doing calculus eyes her book -   *

                    CALCULUS BOY                                 *
          Is that for a class?                                   *

                    LARA JEAN                                    *
          No.                                                    *

                    CALCULUS BOY                                 *
              (judgemental)                                      *
          Yeah. I didn’t think so.                               *

Lara Jean sighs. Maybe she doesn’t belong here either. She       *
bites into a carrot. It crunches. All the studying students      *
glare at her. Someone points to a sign that says: SOFT FOODS     *
ONLY. She picks up her things and leaves.                        *


EXT. BLEACHERS - SAME                                            *

Lara Jean sees Josh eating alone, reading a SCI-FI NOVEL on      *
the empty bleachers. She timidly walks up to him.                *

                    LARA JEAN                                    *
          This seat taken?                                       *

                    JOSH                                         *
          Yep. By you.                                           *

She sits down. Neither is really sure what they are supposed     *
to talk about.                                                   *

                    LARA JEAN                                    *
          It’s kind of weird without Margot,                     *
          huh?                                                   *

                    JOSH                                         *
          Yeah. A little.                                        *

                    LARA JEAN                                    *
          Should we maybe just...                                *
              (she eyes his book)                                *
          ...read?                                               *

                    JOSH                                         *
          Okay.                                                  *

Josh and Lara Jean both pick up their books and read next to     *
one-another. She silently passes him a carrot stick.             *

He takes it. It crunches. He passes her a chip, she takes it.   *
It crunches. Whatever this is - it’s working for now.           *


INT. LARA JEAN’S CAR - AFTERNOON                                *

Lara Jean drives Kitty home from swim practice. Kitty sits in
the front seat in her bathing suit and helmet. Lara Jean is     *
very focused on the road. She grips the wheel like an eighty-   *
year-old woman.                                                 *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          First day was good?                                   *

                    KITTY                                       *
          Great. Alison wanted to sit next to                   *
          me at lunch but so did Brianna and                    *
          so did Katy and Megan so I ended up                   *
          rotating so everyone had time to                      *
          sit next to me. You know?                             *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Yeah. Totally know what’s that’s                      *
          like. And how was swim practice?                      *

                    KITTY                                       *
          That was amazing too. Did you see                     *
          how fast I was going?                                 *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Uh-huh.                                               *

                    KITTY                                       *
          That was like Michael Phelps fast,                    *
          right?                                                *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Um. Maybe not quite Phelps fast...                    *

                    KITTY                                       *
          No. You didn’t see the first match.                   *
          I was totally Phelpsing it.                           *

Lara Jean smiles at her little sister.                          *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Sorry I missed that.                                  *

                    KITTY                                       *
          And I was definitely swimming                         *
          faster than you’re driving right                      *
          now. You know it’s illegal to go                      *
          too slow right?                                       *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 20.


                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          I’m not going too slow. I’m going                    *
          like 5 miles below the speed limit.                  *
          And can you take off that helmet?                    *
          You’re making me nervous.                            *

                    KITTY                                      *
          I’ll take off the helmet if you                      *
          speed up.                                            *

Lara Jean speeds up but, distracted, she misses a stop sign.   *
Before she knows what’s happening she HITS A CAR in the        *
intersection.                                                  *


EXT. SUBURBAN INTERSECTION - SAME

An OLD MAN gets out of his BUICK.                              *

                    LARA JEAN
              (to Kitty, freaking out)
          Oh my god. Are you okay?

Kitty is fine. She’s laughing.

                    KITTY
          Good thing I’m wearing the helmet!                   *

Lara Jean runs up to the old man whose Buick she hit.

                    LARA JEAN
          Sir. I am SO SORRY.

                    OLD MAN
          What the hell were you doing,
          catching pok-e-mon?? Didn’t you see
          me there?

                    LARA JEAN
          Should we call the police?

                    OLD MAN
          The po-po?! I can’t have my whole
          day wrapped up in this crap. I’m
          calling numbers at the VFW in an
          hour. My car is fine. Be more
          careful!

The old man gets back in his car and speeds off.               *

                    KITTY                                      *
          Your contribution to the stereotype                  *
          that Asian women are bad at driving
          is so not cool.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 21.


                    LARA JEAN
          You’re not helping.

                    PETER (O.C.)
          Lara Jean, are you okay?

Lara Jean looks up. Sees Peter.                                 *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          Of course. At moments of highest
          embarrassment you always run into
          the people you want to see least. I
          failed to mention before that Peter
          Kavinsky, Gen’s Peter, also happens
          to be the non-recipient of one of
          my love letters.


INT. PETER KAVINSKY’S BASEMENT - FLASHBACK

Peter, Lara Jean, Gen and some other seventh graders sit in a
circle playing spin the bottle.                                 *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          Seventh Grade. My first real
          boy/girl party.                                       *

Lara Jean picks up the bottle to spin it.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          Everyone knew that Peter and Gen,
          who at this time was still my BFF,
          only wanted to kiss each other.

Lara Jean spins the bottle. It lands on Peter.                  *

                    LARA JEAN
              (to Gen)
          I can spin it again.

The group starts chanting: Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!                    *

                    PETER
          Can’t cheat the bottle.

Peter gets up and kisses Lara Jean. Gen glares at them. Lara
Jean blushes uncontrollably. She stares into Peter’s eyes.      *

BACK TO PRESENT -                                               *

Lara Jean is staring into Peter’s eyes again, but this is the
hot, seventeen year old Peter. The one who’s Gen’s boyfriend.
The one who hasn’t spoken to her in years. Everything is
still fuzzy from the accident. Lara Jean blinks.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)               22.


                    LARA JEAN
          What?

                    PETER
          I said are you okay? Do you want me
          to call triple A for you?

                    LARA JEAN
          Call triple A! Of course. Such an
          idiot.

                    PETER
          Did you just call me an idiot?

                    LARA JEAN
          Did I say that out loud?

                    PETER
          Yes.

                    LARA JEAN
          I was talking to myself.

                    KITTY
              (whispered to Lara Jean)
          Jesus. Be cool woman.

                    PETER
          So, do you want me to call them?                  *

                    LARA JEAN                               *
          No. I can do it. Thanks.                          *

                    PETER
          You sure? You seem pretty shaken
          up. I could wait with you guys til
          they get here.

Kitty stares at Lara Jean and Peter, clocking their
interaction.

                    LARA JEAN
              (embarrassed ramblings)
          We’re fine. Really. You should go.
          Move on down the road. Seriously.                 *

                    PETER
          Okay. But you know you need to move
          the car out of the intersection,
          right? It’s blocking traffic.

Lara Jean looks terrified.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 23.


                    LARA JEAN
          I have to get back in that thing???

                    PETER
          You know what. Here -

He gets in her car and moves it to the side of the road. When   *
he gets out, he tosses Kitty the keys.

                    PETER (CONT’D)
              (to Kitty)
          You’re in charge.

Peter gets in his Audi and drives off.

                    KITTY
          Who was that?                                         *

          The mechanic said it wasn’t a bad                     *
          accident, he just has to order a                      *

          lunch and got whatever random guy                     *

INT. COVEY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME                          *

Lara Jean and Kitty sit on the couch eating raw cookie dough
and watching a Golden Girls marathon.                          *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          What do you think she’s doing                        *
          tonight?                                             *

                    KITTY                                      *
          Crack.                                               *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          Kitty! Why would you say that??                      *

                    KITTY                                      *
          It’s how Scottish people say fun.                    *
          Like “you’re good crack”. I looked                   *
          it up.                                               *

                    LARA JEAN
          Oh. It’s weird not having her here.                  *

                    KITTY
          It’s weird not having Josh here
          too. You don’t think he’ll stop
          coming over now, do you?

                    LARA JEAN
          I mean probably. Why would he want
          to hang out with us now that
          Margot’s gone?

                        Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)            25.


                    KITTY
          I miss his Blanch impression.

They eat cookie dough and look back at the screen.

                    KITTY (CONT’D)
          Lara Jean, have you ever been in
          love?

                    LARA JEAN
              (taken aback)
          Where’d that come from?                          *

                    KITTY
          I was just thinking that since
          Margot’s gone and Josh isn’t coming              *
          over as much and you’re such a                   *
          shitty driver...if you had a
          boyfriend, we’d still have someone
          to take us places. Like, what about
          that guy from the accident?                      *

Lara Jean practically spits out her cookie dough.

                    LARA JEAN
          Do you mean Peter Kavinsky?                      *

                       KITTY
          Yeah. Him.

                    LARA JEAN
          He’s dating Gen.

                       KITTY
          So?

                    LARA JEAN
          So, someone liking me over Gen
          would be like someone liking Rose
          over Blanche.

                    KITTY
          I’ve always preferred Rose. She’s
          got hidden depths.

                    LARA JEAN                              *
          Look, Kitty. We don’t need some guy
          to drive us around. As soon as the
          car is fixed I’m gonna get better
          at driving, okay? I promise.

                    KITTY
          It’s not just that.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                  26.


Kitty pauses. How’s she gonna say this?

                    KITTY (CONT’D)
          Don’t you think it’s kind of
          depressing that it’s the first                        *
          Saturday night of the new school                      *
          year and you’re spending it                           *
          watching a Golden Girls marathon
          with your little sister?

                    LARA JEAN
          No. I love the Golden Girls. And I
          love you.

Lara Jean tries to tickle Kitty. But Kitty is serious.

                    KITTY
          Okay, I’m not telling you this to
          make you feel bad but, Lara Jean,                     *
          I’m nine and I cancelled plans to
          be here tonight. You’re sixteen and
          well, I don’t think you had
          anything else going on...am I
          right?

                    LARA JEAN
          That’s cold, Kitty. That’s sups
          cold.


INT. COVEY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Lara Jean snores on the couch, totally passed out. Kitty
pinches her nose to make sure she’s really asleep. Convinced    *
she’s out, Kitty sneaks away.


INT. LARA JEAN’S BEDROOM - SAME

Kitty moves a chair over to Lara Jean’s closet. She stands on
it and takes something down, we can’t see what.

                    KITTY
          This is for your own good.                            *


EXT. ATHLETIC FIELDS - MONDAY MORNING                           *

Christine and Lara Jean run laps during gym class.              *

                    CHRISTINE                                   *
          What’d you do this weekend?                           *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 27.


                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          I finished my book. It was so good.                  *

                    CHRISTINE                                  *
          Another bodice ripper, you little                    *
          perv?                                                *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          I enjoy them for their camp.                         *

                    CHRISTINE                                  *
          Pssh. Yeah right. Don’t worry,                       *
          girl. No Judgement.                                  *

Lara Jean rolls her eyes and smiles. The girls keep running.   *
Peter Kavinsky runs up next to them. He stares at Lara Jean.

                    PETER
              (to Lara Jean)
          We need to talk.

                    LARA JEAN
              (confused)
          We do?

                    CHRISTINE
          Hey, PK, I heard my cousin dumped
          you for a college dude, is that
          true?

                    PETER
          Hey, Chris, I heard you have a                       *
          tail. Is that true?                                  *

                    CHRISTINE                                  *
          Yep. Curly cue. Like a little                        *
          piggy.                                               *

                    PETER                                      *
          Sick. I need to talk to Lara Jean.                   *
          Alone.

Christine gives Lara Jean a look that says: What does Peter
Kavinsky need to talk to you about? Lara Jean gives a look
back that says: Damned if I know.

                    CHRISTINE                                  *
          If you need me I’ll be pretending                    *
          to have cramps and reading                           *
          magazines in the nurse’s office.                     *

Christine runs off the field.                                  *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 28.


                    PHYS ED TEACHER
              (to Christine)
          Hey! Where do you think you’re
          going?

                    CHRISTINE
              (screaming back)
          I HAVE MY PERIOD!

The coach blushes as moves on.

                    PETER
          Does she really have a tail?                          *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          No. Obviously not.                                    *

                     PETER                                      *
          It’s so weird to me that you guys
          are friends. You have like, nothing
          in common.

                    LARA JEAN
          Is that what you came over here to
          talk to me about?

                    PETER
          No. I want you to know that I’m
          flattered but things with Gen and
          me are still up in the air and
          well, sorry, but - it’s not gonna
          happen.

                    LARA JEAN
              (genuinely confused)
          I’m sorry. What?

Peter pulls LARA JEAN’S LOVE LETTER out of his pocket. As
soon as she sees it she FAINTS on the field. PASSES OUT COLD.


EXT. ATHLETIC FIELDS - A FEW MINUTES LATER

                    PETER
          Lara Jean! Lara Jean. Are you okay?

Lara Jean fuzzily comes to. She’s laying on the field. Peter
is crouching over her.

                    LARA JEAN
          What just happened?

                    PETER
          You just passed out.

                        Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                  29.


Lara Jean looks around. She sees that Josh is walking towards
her.                                                             *

QUICK CUTS as we show three increasing CU shots of LARA          *
JEAN’s LOVE LETTER in Josh’s hand.                               *

                    LARA JEAN
          OH. MY. GOD.

                       PETER
          What?

Josh is getting closer and closer. Lara Jean has no idea what    *
to do. Without thinking she pulls Peter down onto the ground     *
with her and starts furiously making out with him. The coach     *
blows a whistle.

                    COACH
              (to Lara Jean and Peter)
          Hey! Stop that! Don’t make me pull
          the hose on you two!

Lara Jean looks up. Everyone on the field is watching her.

Josh looks extremely confused. He looks down at his own          *
letter then back at Lara Jean and Peter.                         *

                    PETER
              (confused but impressed)                           *
          Damn. That was unexpected.                             *

Lara Jean is dumbfounded. What the hell did she just do?!?!?     *

                    LARA JEAN
          OH. MY. GOD.

                    PETER
          Yeah. I’ll say.

                    LARA JEAN
          Ohmygod. Ohmygod. Ohmygod.

She jumps up and sprints off the field. She doesn’t stop
sprinting until she’s in the -


INT. GIRL’S BATHROOM

Lara Jean runs into a stall, slamming the door behind her.
She’s sweating. WTF is happening?? She presses her fingers
into her temples, praying this is all a dream, knowing that
it’s not. She hears a small tap on the stall door.

                       Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                30.


                    LUCAS (O.C.)
          Lara Jean? Are you in there?

Lara Jean opens the door to see LUCAS, 16, black, too
handsome for high school with the one exception that he’s
still a little scrawny. He holds a LOVE LETTER in his hand.     *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          Oh god. Lucas James. Letter number
          three.

FLASHBACK -


INT. SCHOOL GYM - HOMECOMING - FRESHMAN YEAR

The school gym is decorated. Freshman versions of Gen and
Peter dance in the midst of a huge crowd of people. Over by     *
the punch bowl Lucas stands by himself, bopping his head to
the music. He wears a CRAVAT.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          Homecoming. Freshman year. Lucas
          and I both went alone and we both
          still had braces.

Freshman Lara Jean walks up to freshman Lucas. Both of their
braces are OUT OF CONTROL. This is not invisaline.

                      LARA JEAN
          Hi Lucas.

                    LUCAS
          Oh, hi Lara Jean. Who are you here
          with?

                    LARA JEAN
          Well I drove with my sister and
          Josh if that’s what you mean-

She motions to Margot and Josh who are slow dancing together.

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
          But I don’t have a date or
          anything.

                    LUCAS
          Yeah, me neither.

                    LARA JEAN
          Is that an ascot?

                                                         31.


                    LUCAS
              (touching his chest self-
               consciously)
          It’s a cravat.

                    LARA JEAN
          It looks really cool on you. I
          don’t think anybody else here would
          be able to pull it off.

                    LUCAS
          Thanks. I like your braid crown.

                    LARA JEAN
              (touching her head in the
               same way)
          My little sister did it for me.

The music changes to something obscure for high school. PULP -
Disco 2000, something like that.

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
          I love this song.

                    LUCAS
              (surprised)
          You do?

                    LARA JEAN
          Yeah. I found it my mom’s old
          record collection.

                    LUCAS
          I love it too. I went thru a huge
          new wave phase last summer.

They both bop their heads silently for a couple beats.

                    LARA JEAN
          Hey, do you think maybe, since
          neither of us came with any one...

                    LUCAS
              (jumping on the invite)
          Oh my god. I thought you’d never
          ask! Come on, braid crown! Let’s
          hit it.

He does a large, almost choreographed dance move and drags
Lara Jean onto the dance floor. She laughs and they dance
like crazy, totally having more fun than any one else.

BACK TO PRESENT -

                                                         32.


Lara Jean stares at Lucas.

                    LARA JEAN
          This is the girl’s bathroom.

                     LUCAS
          I know. I just came in here
          because...
              (holding the letter)
          I thought you might want this back.
          It seemed pretty personal.

She shyly takes the letter.

                    LARA JEAN
          Thanks.
              (small beat)
          Lucas, please know I wrote that
          letter years ago -

                    LUCAS
          After freshman homecoming. Right?

Lara Jean’s cheeks start to burn but then -

                    LUCAS (CONT’D)
              (smiling)
          I had a lot of fun that night too.
              (small beat)
          I feel like I should tell you
          though...
              (lowering his voice)
          You know that I’m gay right?

                       LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          I did not.

                    LARA JEAN
          Oh. Of course. Right. Yeah.

                    LUCAS
          But don’t like tell anyone if
          that’s okay. I’m out, I’m not
          ashamed or anything. My mom knows.
          My dad “kind of” knows. It’s just -

          LARA JEAN                              LUCAS
High school.                      High school.

                    LUCAS (CONT’D)
              (after a beat)
          You wanna talk about why you’re
          hiding out in the toilet?

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 33.


                    LARA JEAN
          Oh, just wondering whether I should
          Anna Karenina or Sylvia Plath it...

                    LUCAS
          Sorry, I’m not taking AP Lit.

                    LARA JEAN
          No, I mean, should I jump in front
          of a train or put my head in the
          oven to kill myself.

                    LUCAS
          Oh is that all? And here you had me                 *
          worried.

They both smile, it’s clear they are going to be friends.


INT. COVEY HOUSE - FOYER - LATER                              *

Lara Jean walks into her house after school with Kitty. Her
dad is in the kitchen cooking.

                    DR. COVEY
          How were my favorite girls’ first                   *
          day back?

                    LARA JEAN
              (too intense)
          Have you seen my hat box?

                    DR. COVEY
          Whoa. No hi dad. No, how nice you
          took the afternoon off to greet us?

                    LARA JEAN
          I need to know where my hat box is,
          it was Mom’s and it was very
          important to me and I NEED IT!

                    DR. COVEY
          Gosh, I dunno. Sweetie. Is there
          any way it could have ended up in
          one of the Good Will boxes?                         *

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
              (a loud whine)                                  *
          The Good Will Boxes?!?! No!                         *

                    DR. COVEY                                 *
          By the way you got some mail.                       *

                       Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                   34.


Lara Jean sees A LOVE LETTER by the front door marked RETURN     *
TO SENDER. She grabs the letter, screams and runs up to her      *
room. Dr. Covey looks at Kitty. He’s totally at a loss.          *

                    DR. COVEY (CONT’D)
          What’s the matter with her?

                      KITTY
          Moon day?

                    DR. COVEY
          How do you know what a moon day is?

                    KITTY
          Daddy. I’m nine. In three years
          I’ll have a moon day of my own.

Dr. Covey gulps. Being a single father of girls is hard.         *


INT. COVEY HOUSE - LARA JEAN’S BEDROOM

Lara Jean, paces, talking to herself like a crazy person.        *

                    LARA JEAN
          Oh my god. Ohmygod. Ohmygod.                           *
          Ohmygod. Okay. Okay. The box is
          gone. The letters are out.                             *

She looks at the returned letter.                                *

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)                           *
          Silver lining: at least Kenny from                     *
          Camp will never found out how hard                     *
          you were crushing after that game                      *
          of Chubby Bunny.                                       *

Kitty knocks on the door...                                      *

                    KITTY                                        *
          Lara Jean? Are you okay? You’re                        *
          acting like a total spazz. Dad’s                       *
          worried.                                               *

                    LARA JEAN                                    *
          I’m fine. It’s just. Something kind                    *
          of bad happened today.                                 *

                    KITTY                                        *
          You ran over a dog?                                    *

                      LARA JEAN                                  *
          What? No!                                              *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)         35.


                    KITTY                             *
              (smiling)                               *
          No dead dogs. How bad could it be?          *

                    LARA JEAN                         *
          Bad.                                        *

                    KITTY                             *
          Can you talk to Margot about it?            *
          She can fix anything.                       *

                    LARA JEAN                         *
          It’s too late to call Scotland.             *

Kitty looks at the clock, skeptically.                *

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)                *
          Or, she’s probably busy like,               *
          buying a kilt or something.                 *

                    KITTY                             *
          What?                                       *

                     LARA JEAN                        *
          Sorry, Kitty. I just need some time         *
          by myself.                                  *

                    KITTY                             *
          Well, whatever it is... maybe see           *
          if there’s a way you could try and          *
          think of it as a good thing?                *

                    LARA JEAN                         *
          There’s no way to think that.               *

Kitty exits.                                          *

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)                *
              (talking to herself)                    *
          Think. Think. Think. It’s fine.             *
          It’s fine. All you have to do is            *
          avoid Josh for the rest of your             *
          life. Easy.                                 *

                    DR. COVEY (O.S.)
              (calling up the stairs)
          Lara Jean! Josh is here.                    *

                    LARA JEAN
          Shit. Not so easy.                          *

She looks at her open window.                         *

                         Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)              36.


EXT. COVEY HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER                     *

We see Lara Jean climb down the side of the house. Once on      *
the ground she grabs KITTY’S BIKE and takes off down the        *
street. When she’s safely out of sight, she takes out her       *
phone and texts her dad -

TEXT: STUDY GROUP AT THE DINER. BE HOME LATER.


INT. COVEY HOUSE - SAME

Mr. Covey looks at his phone and then at Josh.

                    DR. COVEY
          Huh. Guess you just missed her.                       *


EXT. DINER - ESTABLISHING - EVENING                             *

We are outside the MOONSTAR DINER - a local teen hang out.      *
Lara Jean used to come here with Margot and Josh. Now - she’s   *
here alone. We see Kitty’s bike locked up outside.              *


INT. DINER - SAME                                               *

Lara Jean sits in a booth. She’s picking up straw-fulls of      *
soda and letting them pour back into her cup. An ALGEBRA
TEXTBOOK is sitting next to her, unopened. A waitress, JOAN,    *
60’s, walks up to her.

                     JOAN
          You okay, honey? You seem a little
          out of it.

                    LARA JEAN
          I’m great, thanks. Just doing my
          homework.

Joan looks at the closed text book skeptically, walks away.     *

We hear the little bell on the door jingle. Lara Jean looks
up. It’s Peter. Holy shit. She came here to avoid Josh and
now she runs into Peter. This day couldn’t get worse. She
tries to look away but he’s already sliding into her booth.     *

                       PETER
          Lara Jean.

Before she can speak -

                       Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)         37.


                    PETER (CONT’D)
              (to Joan)
          Can I get a chocolate shake?                 *

                    LARA JEAN
          What are you doing here?

                    PETER
          Your dad said you’d be here.                 *

                    LARA JEAN                          *
          You talked to my dad?? Why?                  *

                    PETER                              *
          Nice “study group” turn out by the           *
          way.                                         *

                    LARA JEAN
          I am studying. If you’ll excuse me -         *

She opens the book.

                    PETER
          Whoa, whoa, whoa. You think you can
          kiss me like that then play hard to
          get? I don’t think so, Covey.

                      LARA JEAN
          Oh god.

She puts her head on the table.

                    PETER
              (misunderstanding her
               humiliation)
          Hey, don’t be embarrassed. I told
          you I’m flattered. You’re cute, in
          a quirky kind of way and the kiss
          was surprisingly hot. But Gen and I
          just broke up so I’m not really in
          the place to -

                    LARA JEAN
              (looking up)
          Hold up. Are you trying to reject
          me right now?

                    PETER
          Well, yeah cuz it didn’t seem like
          it really took the first time.

                    LARA JEAN
          I am not trying to date you, Peter           *
          Kavinsky.                                    *

                        Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)               38.


                    PETER
          Your mouth is saying one thing but
          your mouth said another.

                       LARA JEAN
          What?

                    PETER
          Like, you’re talking but then the
          kiss. I guess they’re both your
          mouth. Yeah, that’s confusing.

Joan comes back and puts Peter’s shake on the table.          *

                    PETER (CONT’D)                            *
          Thanks, Joan.                                       *

He winks at Joan. She blushes.                                *

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
          Do you have to flirt with everyone?                 *
          She’s like sixty.                                   *

                    PETER                                     *
          Aw, don’t be jealous of Joan. She                   *
          doesn’t have what we have.                          *

He laughs, unwraps a straws and sticks them in the shake.     *

                       PETER (CONT’D)                         *
          Want some?                                          *

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
          No. And to be clear about what                      *
          happened today, you should know                     *
          that I don’t actually like you. I                   *
          just needed to make it look like I                  *
          liked you so someone else wouldn’t
          think I like them. Get it?                          *

                     PETER                                    *
          Sounds pretty convoluted. I think
          you love me and this whole “other
          guy” story’s just to throw me off
          the scent.

                    LARA JEAN
          You’re so full of yourself.

                    PETER
          That may be, but until you tell me
          mystery stud’s name, I’ll remain
          convinced you have a secret tattoo
          of my face on your ass.

              Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)       39.


          LARA JEAN
Gross. Fine. It’s Josh Sanderson.

          PETER
Sanderson? Wait. Hold up. Doesn’t
that guy like, date your sister?

          LARA JEAN
Yeah. Well, used to.

          PETER
And you like him? Sick.

          LARA JEAN
I told you. I don’t like him. But I
guess I used to. And he got a
letter too. And he’s my best
friend. Or was. And yes. Also my
sister’s ex-boyfriend. So you can
see how complicated and                     *
embarrassing it would be if he
thought, you know...                        *

           PETER
So wait...
    (realizing)
I’m not the only one who got a
letter?
    (sarcastic but also kind
     of disappointed)
Man, you think you’re special then
you find out she sent love letter
to two guys...

             LARA JEAN
Five.

             PETER
Excuse me?

          LARA JEAN
There were five letters total so
don’t go feeling too special.

          PETER
Five?! Jesus. Who else?

          LARA JEAN
I don’t wanna talk about this.

          PETER
Come on, Juliet. Who else got a
letter?

                       Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 40.


                    LARA JEAN
          If I tell you will you leave me
          alone?

                     PETER
          Maybe.

                    LARA JEAN
          Lucas James.

                    PETER
          Lucas James?!? That guy is gay.

                    LARA JEAN
          You don’t know that.

                    PETER
          Everyone knows that. Who else?

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          This guy I went to camp with and                     *
          someone from Model UN last year.                     *

Peter is staring at Lara Jean like he’s really noticing her    *
for the first time. Like he’s trying to figure her out. He’s   *
about to say something, but then -

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
          And for the record. I’m really
          sorry I kissed you. It was stupid.                   *
          And gross. And I can promise you it
          will never happen again. So...are                    *
          we good here?

                    PETER
              (caught off guard)
          Yeah. We’re good.


EXT. DINER -   A FEW MINUTES LATER

                    PETER
          Where are you parked?

                    LARA JEAN
          My car’s still in the shop. I rode
          my bike.

Peter sees the BRIGHT PINK HUFFY WITH GLITTER HANDLES.

                    PETER
          That’s your bike?

                        Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)               41.


                    LARA JEAN
          Well, it’s my little sister’s.

                    PETER
          No. As long as anyone in this town
          thinks you’re my girlfriend, even
          if it is just Sanderson, I can’t
          let you ride that thing home. Come
          on, I’ll give you a lift.

Lara Jean feels a little weird but gets into Peter’s Audi. He
puts Kitty’s bike in the trunk and they’re off.


EXT. COVEY HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

Peter pulls up in front of Lara Jean’s house.

                    LARA JEAN
          So, um, thanks for the ride. Sorry
          again about the jumping you thing.

                    PETER
          Meh. Coulda been worse.
              (small beat)
          So...what are you planning on
          telling Sanderson when he finds out
          we’re not actually dating?

                     LARA JEAN
          I guess I’ll just have to tell him
          the truth.

                    PETER
          But what’s the truth? That you like
          him or that you don’t?

Beat. She looks down. Not wanting to answer the question.       *

                    LARA JEAN
          It’s not your problem, Peter. Sorry
          again for dragging you into it.

She starts to open the door.                                    *

                    PETER                                       *
          So, what if you didn’t tell him?                      *

Lara Jean stops. Looks at Peter. Where is he going with this?   *

                       LARA JEAN                                *
          Excuse me?                                            *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 42.


                    PETER                                      *
          What if we kept it up for awhile.                    *
          Let people think we’re a couple.                     *
          Not just Sanderson. Everybody.                       *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          Why would you want that?                             *

                    PETER                                      *
          I’m just thinking. When Gen saw you                  *
          kiss me, she went nuts.                              *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          Ah. Of course it’s about Gen.                        *

                    PETER                                      *
          What does that mean?                                 *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          You’re obsessed with her.                            *

                    PETER                                      *
          No! See. That’s the whole point!                     *
          She thinks she owns me. I want her                   *
          to know she doesn’t.                                 *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          So I’m a pawn.                                       *

                    PETER                                      *
          Hey. You made me a pawn first when                   *
          you jumped me.                                       *
              (small beat)                                     *
          You don’t have to answer now. Just                   *
          think about it. Okay?                                *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          Don’t get your hopes up.                             *

She gets out of the car, grabs her bike out of the trunk and   *
walks into her house.

Peter starts up his car then sees Josh walking his dog down    *
the street. They make eye contact.

                    PETER
          Hey. Sanderson, right?

                    JOSH
          Yeah. Hi. Are you dropping Lara                      *
          Jean off?

                    PETER
          Looks like it.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 43.


                    JOSH
          Sorry. How long have you guys been                    *
          dating?                                               *

                    PETER
              (devilish smile)                                  *
          Not long. But I really like her!                      *

Peter drives off quickly. Josh stares after him, confused       *


INT. LARA JEAN’S BEDROOM - LATER                                *

Lara Jean lies in bed. She stares at her phone, trying to       *
figure out what to text Josh. She’s talking to herself, which   *
she’s been doing kind of a lot lately...                        *

                     LARA JEAN                                  *
          Josh. I lied. Peter’s not my                          *
          boyfriend. But that still doesn’t                     *
          mean I like you because that would                    *
          be disgusting. And please never                       *
          tell Margot about the letter or the                   *
          shame and embarrassment will make                     *
          me vom until I die of dehydration.                    *
              (beat)                                            *
          Too dramatic?                                         *
              (beat)                                            *
          Not dramatic enough?                                  *

Lara Jean goes to her bedside table and looks at the photo of   *
her and her sisters with their mom. CU on Margot. Lara Jean     *
turns the photo upside down. She can’t have Margot looking at   *
her right now.                                                  *

We hear little taps against the window. Lara Jean walks over    *
to it and looks down. Josh is standing at the bottom throwing
rocks up at it. She goes to hide behind the curtain -

                    JOSH
              (loud whisper)
          We just made eye contact! You can’t
          pretend like you don’t see me.                        *

She sighs and goes to the window.

                    LARA JEAN
          I’ll be right down.


EXT. COVEY HOUSE / SANDERSON HOUSE - SAME

Lara Jean stands with Josh in the same place he stood with      *
Margot just over a week ago. It’s awkward. After a pause -      *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 44.


                     JOSH                                     *
          Why now?                                            *

                     LARA JEAN                                *
          What?                                               *

                    JOSH                                      *
          Why would you send me that now?                     *

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
          I didn’t send it. I lost it.                        *

                    JOSH                                      *
          You lost it?                                        *

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
          I never meant for you to see it.                    *

Josh looks down. He clearly has very complicated feelings     *
about what’s going on.                                        *

                    JOSH                                      *
          And Kavinsky?                                       *

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
          What about him.                                     *

                    JOSH                                      *
          You’re dating?                                      *

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
          Is it so unbelievable?                              *

                     JOSH                                     *
          Yes.                                                *

                     LARA JEAN                                *
          Why?                                                *

                    JOSH
          Because, you’re like this sweet,                    *
          innocence girl and he’s a dick.                     *

                    LARA JEAN
          You make me sound so boring. I’m
          not that innocent.

                    JOSH
          Okay, Britney Spears.

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
          And how would you like it if I
          called someone you were dating a
          dick?

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)         45.


                    JOSH
          Well, you wouldn’t because the only
          person I’ve ever dated is Margot
          who’s the exact opposite of a dick.
          I mean, come on Lara Jean. Don’t
          tell me Peter’s the kind of guy you
          wanna be with?                              *

                    LARA JEAN                         *
          What if he is? What’s it to you?            *

                    JOSH                              *
          Did you mean what you wrote in the          *
          letter?                                     *

                    LARA JEAN                         *
          No. I don’t know. It was a long             *
          time ago.                                   *

                    JOSH                              *
          Why didn’t you ever tell me? You            *
          talked about stuff that happened            *
          before Margot and I ever -                  *

                    LARA JEAN                         *
          I can’t talk to you about this.             *

                    JOSH                              *
          I’m just trying to understand.              *

                    LARA JEAN                         *
          There’s nothing to understand. If I         *
          could go back in time. I never              *
          would have written that letter. It          *
          grosses me out that I ever did.             *

                     JOSH                             *
              (hurt)                                  *
          Wow. Okay. Point taken.                     *

                    LARA JEAN                         *
          And please promise me you will              *
          never tell Margot about this.               *

                    JOSH                              *
          Well she’s not even talking to me
          anymore. So...don’t worry.

                    LARA JEAN
          Okay.                                       *

Lara Jean starts to walk away.                        *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                    46.


                    JOSH                                         *
          So that’s it? Margot dumped me,                        *
          your dating Kavinsky and we can’t                      *
          even be friends.                                       *

                    LARA JEAN                                    *
          Josh. How? We can’t be how we were                     *
          before you dated Margot and we                         *
          can’t be how we were when she was                      *
          here -                                                 *

                    JOSH                                         *
              (quietly)                                          *
          If I’d known I’d end up losing both                    *
          of you...                                              *

                    LARA JEAN                                    *
              (cutting him off)                                  *
          Stop. Don’t finish that sentence.                      *
          We can’t talk about this. We                           *
          can’t...talk.                                          *

Lara Jean walks back into her house - she’s anxious, upset.      *
Her cheeks burn. Her face hardens. She makes a decision.         *

                                                SMASH TO:        *


EXT. ATHLETIC FIELDS - THE NEXT DAY                              *

Lara Jean walks across the athletic fields towards where the     *
lacrosse team is practicing.                                     *

                    LARA JEAN                                    *
          Hey, Kavinsky!                                         *

Peter looks up, surprised, runs over to her.                     *

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)                           *
          I’m in.                                                *

                    PETER                                        *
          Solid.                                                 *

Before she knows what’s happening, he GRABS HER AND KISSES       *
HER with the whole lacrosse team watching.                       *


EXT. ADLER HIGH CAMPS - LATER                                    *

Peter and Lara Jean sit under a tree post-practice. He’s         *
drinking a Gatorade. She pulls out a note pad.                   *

                        Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)               47.


                    LARA JEAN                                 *
          If we’re gonna do this, I think we                  *
          need a contract so that we’re on
          the same page about the rules.

                    PETER
          Rules? You really know how to zap                   *
          the fun outta of a situation, huh?

                    LARA JEAN
          It’s important to know where we
          stand on certain...issues.

                       PETER
          Like what?

                    LARA JEAN
          Like I don’t want you to kiss me
          anymore.

                    PETER
          What? That’s crazy! Who’s gonna
          believe we’re dating if I’m not
          allowed to kiss you.

                    LARA JEAN
          You might be Marlon Brando when it                  *
          comes to this stuff but I’ve never                  *
          had a boyfriend before.

                    PETER                                     *
          You have the references of an                       *
          eighty-year-old woman. Why does                     *
          that matter?                                        *

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
          It matters because I don’t want all                 *
          my firsts to be fake. If I’m gonna
          be making out with someone, I want
          it to be real.

                    PETER
          But you kissed me first!

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          If we’re really counting Peter, you
          kissed me first, in seventh grade.                  *
          But let’s not get into that now.

                    LARA JEAN
          Sorry, this one’s nonnegotiable.

She write in big block letters NO KISSING on the top of the
contract then holds it up to make sure he sees it.

                         Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)         48.


                       PETER
             Fine but we gotta do something!
             People will get suspicious if I
             never touch you.

                       LARA JEAN
                 (thinking)                              *
             How bout this? You can put your
             hand in my back pocket.                     *

                       PETER
             Hand in your back pocket?? What the
             hell is that?

                       LARA JEAN
             Haven’t you ever seen Sixteen
             Candles? It’s like, the opening
             image. It’s a couples thing.                *

                       PETER
             Yeah. Maybe in the 70’s.

                       LARA JEAN
             Sixteen Candles is 80’s. John
             Hughes?

Peter stares at her blankly.

                       LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
             Wait, have you never seen it?

He shrugs.

                       LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
             Okay, two more rules: you have to
             watch Sixteen Candles with me               *
             because it’s a classic and also, we
             can never tell anyone that the
             relationship is fake. It would be
             too humiliating for both of us.

                       PETER
             Duh. First rule of fight club...

                       LARA JEAN
             What?

                       PETER
             Are you serious? Okay - double
             feature. We’re watching Fight Club
             after we watch that candle movie.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 49.


                    LARA JEAN
              (writing)
          Fight Club / Sixteen Candles double
          feature. No snitching. What else?

                    PETER
          How bout I write you a note every
          day?

                    LARA JEAN
              (kind of touched)
          Wait. Really? You would do that?

                    PETER
          Sure. Gen was always getting on me
          to write her notes and I never did
          so if I start sending them to you,                  *
          that’d really piss her off.

                    LARA JEAN
          How romantic.

But she writes it down - PETER WILL WRITE LARA JEAN A NOTE
EVERY DAY.

                    PETER
              (raising the stakes)
          And you have to come to parties
          with me. And my lacrosse games.

                    LARA JEAN
              (raised again)
          Then you have to drive me and my
          sister to school.

                    PETER
              (trump card)
          Fine. But you have to come on the
          ski trip.

                     LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          Whoa. The Adler High ski-trip was
          infamous for being the location
          where more students lost their
          virginity than senior week and prom
          combined. I have never been.
          Obviously.                                          *

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
          That’s like three months away. Do                   *
          you really think we’ll still be
          doing this then?

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 50.


                    PETER
          Let’s call it a contingency. No one
          would ever let their boyfriend go
          on the ski trip without them - so
          if we’re still doing this when the
          trip happens - you’re coming.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          I am CERTAIN that by the time the
          ski trip comes around Peter and I
          will be ancient history. That is
          the ONLY reason I say -

                    LARA JEAN
          Deal.

We see quick cuts of Lara Jean and Peter both signing the
contract and shaking hands. Game on.


INT. COVEY HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Kitty and Lara Jean makes their lunches.

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
          Come on. We need to hurry or we’re                  *
          gonna be late.                                      *

                    KITTY
          I hate taking the bus. It’s so                      *
          embarrassing.

                    LARA JEAN
          Actually, we’re not taking the bus
          today.

Kitty looks confused. Then we hear intense hip-hop coming
from outside.

                    KITTY
          What’s that?


EXT. COVEY HOUSE - SAME

Peter pulls up in his Audi. The radio blasting.

                    LARA JEAN
          That’s our ride.

                    PETER
              (calling out)
          You girls ready or what?

                       Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                51.


                    KITTY
          Oh hell yes.


INT. PETER’S AUDI - MORNING

Peter drives Lara Jean and Kitty to school. Kitty drinks a
Korean Yogurt.

                    PETER
          Yo. Little Lara Jean, what’s that
          thing you’re drinking?

                    KITTY
          It’s a Korean yogurt smoothie. And
          don’t call me little Lara Jean.
          That’s creepy.

                    PETER
          So what should I call you?

                    KITTY
          My name, thanks for asking, is
          Katherine Song Covey. Kitty to my
          friends. You can call me Katherine.

                    PETER
              (to Lara Jean)
          Whoa. Feisty.

                    KITTY
          So how do you know my sister again?

                     PETER
              (stumbling)
          Oh, uh, well, I guess. I’m her
          boyfriend.

Lara Jean was taking a sip from a bottle of water and almost   *
chokes on it. They never said anything about lying to their    *
families.

                    KITTY
          You guess or you’re sure?

                    PETER
          I’m sure. Hey, let me have a sip of
          that yogurt thing.

She hands it to him.

                    PETER (CONT’D)
          This is good. Bring me one of these                  *
          tomorrow.

                         Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)             52.


                    KITTY
          You’re gonna drive us again?

                    PETER
          Course.

                    KITTY
          Okay. You can call me Kitty.

                    PETER
              (to Lara Jean)
          Progress.


INT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Lara Jean and Peter park and get out.

                    LARA JEAN
          Thanks for the ride.

She starts to walk away.

                    PETER
          Where do you think you’re going?                   *

                    LARA JEAN
          To the library?

                    PETER
          Nah. You’re coming with me.

He puts his arm around her and leads her towards the         *
cafeteria.                                                   *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)                         *
          I was used to being invisible.                     *

People stare at Lara Jean as she walks with Peter.           *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)                         *
          But now people were looking at me.                 *

She sees two girls looking at her, they whisper.             *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)                         *
          Talking about me.                                  *

Peter and Lara Jean arrive at the -                          *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 53.


INT. THE CAFETERIA - SAME                                       *

Lots of popular kids lounge on the tables eating muffins,
drinking coffee, laughing. Lara Jean is nervous to be here,     *
she looks over and sees Gen glaring at her and Peter.           *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)                            *
          It was way too intense.                               *

                     PETER                                      *
              (leading her in)                                  *
          Come on. There’s nothing to be                        *
          afraid of.

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Actually I’ve got some homework                       *
          stuff I need to catch up on before                    *
          class. I’ll see you later, okay?                      *

                    PETER                                       *
          Wait.                                                 *

Peter HANDS HER A NOTE that says LARA JEAN CIRCLED IN A HEART   *
on the front. Lara Jean takes the note and puts it in her       *
backpack without reading it. Peter slips his hand into her      *
back jean pocket.                                               *

Gen sees this, loudly pushes her chair out from the table and   *
exits the cafeteria in a huff. Peter whispers in Lara Jean’s    *
ear -                                                           *

                    PETER (CONT’D)
              (whispered, happy)
          Nice job.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          It’s weird and somewhat off-putting
          to be congratulated on doing
          nothing more than accepting a note                    *
          and having an ass pocket for                          *
          someone to stick their palm into.
          But I guess that’s where my life
          had taken me.                                         *


EXT. ATHLETIC FIELDS - GYM CLASS - AFTERNOON                    *

Christine and Lara Jean run around the track.                   *

                    CHRISTINE                                   *
          This Kavinsky thing is insane! Who                    *
          knew you had a secret boner for the                   *
          king of the cafeteria crowd.                          *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                   54.


                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Trust me. I’m as surprised as you                     *
          are.                                                  *

                    CHRISTINE                                   *
          Did Margot freak?                                     *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Actually, I haven’t told her yet.                     *
          I’ve kind of been...avoiding her                      *
          calls.                                                *

                    CHRISTINE                                   *
          Well, you know what they say.                         *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          What?                                                 *

                    CHRISTINE                                   *
          If you’re keeping secrets it’s                        *
          probably because your sister is a                     *
          judgemental priss.                                    *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Definitely not an expression.                         *

Chris shrugs.                                                   *

                     CHRISTINE                                  *

INT. LARA JEAN’S BEDROOM - FRIDAY NIGHT

Lara Jean stares at the skype icon on her computer. She         *
practices what to say to Margot.                                *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Hi Margot. How’s college? Cool.                       *
          Cool. By the way, did I mention I                     *
          have a fake boyfriend? I didn’t.                      *
          How odd. Yeah, it’s Peter Kavinsky.                   *
          Yeah, that jock-ish, douche-ish                       *
          Peter. How did it start?                              *
          Well...let’s see. It definitely                       *
          wasn’t because I don’t want your ex-                  *
          boyfriend to think I’m in love with                   *
          him. That’s for sure.                                 *
              (small beat)                                      *
          Shit.                                                 *

Lara Jean is about to close out of Skype and give up when the   *
ICON starts RINGING on the SCREEN.                              *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 55.


CU: MARGOTCOVEY5 WANTS TO SKYPE. Lara Jean presses ACCEPT.    *

                    MARGOT                                    *
          There you are!                                      *

                    LARA JEAN                                 *

          Well...                                             *
              (chickening out)                                *
          I’m making cupcakes for Kitty’s                     *
          class bake sale tonight.                            *

                    MARGOT                                    *
              (making a face)                                 *
          Cupcakes?                                           *

                    LARA JEAN
          What?

                    MARGOT
          It’s so much easier to do brownies.                 *

                    LARA JEAN
              (getting defensive)                             *
          Well, I already bought all the                      *
          ingredients for cupcakes. And                       *
          you’re not even here. So.                           *

                    MARGOT                                    *
          Whoa. Okay. Sorry. Do cupcakes. I’m                 *
          sure they’ll be great.                              *
              (small beat)                                    *
          Anyway, how is everything? I feel                   *
          like we haven’t talked in forever.                  *

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
          Everything’s fine. Nothing to                       *
          report.                                             *

                    MARGOT                                    *
          Have you seen Josh recently?                        *

                     LARA JEAN                                *
          Why do you think I’m hanging out                    *
          with Josh?                                          *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 56.


                    MARGOT                                     *
          I dunno. It was just a question. I                   *
          feel like I don’t know anything
          about what’s going on there.                         *

                    LARA JEAN
          That’s because you need to focus on
          college and not your ex-boyfriend.

                    MARGOT
          Are you mad at me for something?

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          No sorry. I guess I’m just anxious                   *
          to start those cupcakes. So. I
          should probably go. Do that.                         *

                    MARGOT
          Wait, Lara Jean-

                    LARA JEAN
          Bye Margot!

Lara Jean quickly closes the computer, panting.                *


INT. COVEY HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER                             *

Lara Jean measures flour for cupcakes when someone knocks on   *
the kitchen door, startling her, and making her spill the      *
flour all over herself.                                        *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          Ah!                                                  *

She looks up, Peter waves. She opens the door, let’s him in.   *

                    PETER
          Who are you supposed to be? The
          Pillsbury dough boy?

                     LARA JEAN
          I’m making cupcakes for Kitty’s
          bake sale.                                           *

                    PETER
          Cupcakes, huh? You know it’s easier
          if you make something you can cut
          into squares like brownies. That’s
          what my mom does for my brother.

                    LARA JEAN
          What are you doing here, Peter?

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 57.


                    PETER
          Didn’t you read my note? I’m                        *
          picking you up for Greg’s Party.

                    LARA JEAN
          What? I’m not going to that.                        *

She goes back to measuring flour.

                    PETER
          But you have to go. Gen’s gonna be                  *
          there. I can’t show up alone!

                    LARA JEAN
          Sorry, Peter. I can’t.                              *

                    DR. COVEY (O.C.)
          You can’t what?

Dr. Covey walks into the kitchen. Sees Peter and Lara Jean.   *

                    LARA JEAN
          Dad? When did you get home from the
          hospital?

                    DR. COVEY
          Wow, is that Peter Kavinsky? I                      *
          remember you from the middle school
          gang!

                    PETER
              (suddenly very polite)
          Nice to see you Dr. Covey. I just
          came to pick up Lara Jean for my
          friend’s party. Parents will be
          home and I’ll have her back early.
          Is it alright if we go?

                    LARA JEAN
          I already told you it’s not because
          I have to bake these cupcakes.                      *

                    DR. COVEY
          Oh, I think Kitty and I can handle
          these. Why don’t you go get changed
          and have fun with your friend.

Lara Jean looks at her father and then at Peter. She groans
then exits.

                    PETER
              (to Dr. Covey)
          What’s in the bag?

                                                          58.


                    DR. COVEY
          Take-out from my Samos, my favorite
          Greek restaurant. Have you ever had
          their lamb gyros?

                    PETER
          I don’t think so.

                    DR. COVEY
          They’re very baaaaaa-d.

Dr. Covey laughs to himself. Peter nods like, good one.


INT. LARA JEAN’S BEDROOM -

Lara Jean holds up two outfits. Kitty sits on her bed.

                    LARA JEAN
          Romper or crop top? I usually wear
          the crop top with an oversized
          cardigan but it was Margot’s and
          she took it with her and the jeans
          it looks good with have a hole in
          the butt, and - ugh, it’s hopeless.

                    KITTY
          Hey relax. Wear the romper. You
          look really cute in rompers. Like
          the prettiest toddler.

                    LARA JEAN
          The prettiest toddler always grows
          up to look super weird! Maybe I
          just shouldn’t go.

                    KITTY
          Of course you should go. Do you
          really wanna spend another Friday
          night rearranging your sock drawer?

                    LARA JEAN
          You saw that?

                    KITTY
          It gave me nightmares.

As Lara Jean searches her closet for something to wear, Kitty
picks a NOTE up off the floor. It was tossed aside, next to
the trash bin. It’s from Peter and says GREG’S PARTY TONIGHT?

                    KITTY (CONT’D)
          How come you don’t save the notes
          Peter sends you?

                         Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)              59.


                    LARA JEAN
          I dunno. I guess cuz they don’t
          seem that important.

                    KITTY
          But you save everything.

Lara Jean comes out of the closet. She wears a black t-shirt
dress with a jean jacket and sneakers. Simple. Perfect.

                    LARA JEAN
          How do I look?

                     KITTY
          Bangin’.

Lara Jean smiles. Kitty pockets the note.


EXT. MCMANSION - NIGHT

Peter and Lara Jean walk up to the front door.

                    LARA JEAN
          So what am I supposed to do at this
          thing anyway? I don’t drink and I’m
          not friends with anyone here.

                    PETER
          Strangers are just friends you
          haven’t made yet.

                    LARA JEAN
          These aren’t strangers. They’re
          people who’ve spent the past three
          years actively ignoring me.

                    PETER
          All you have to do is pretend like
          you’re in love with me. It’ll be                      *
          fun.

                    LARA JEAN
          Fun for you maybe.

She keeps nervously putting her hair up and then taking it
back down. Peter grabs her hair tie - it’s the soft ribbon
kind and this one has LITTLE PANDAS ON IT - he puts it around
his wrist.

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
          Hey, gimme that back.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 60.


                    PETER
          No. I’m keeping it. I like your
          hair down. You look pretty, see?

He takes a photo of her with his phone and shows it to her.

                    LARA JEAN
          Fine but don’t lose it. The one
          with the pandas is my favorite.                       *

                    PETER                                       *
          Deal. Hey, gimme your phone for a                     *
          sec.                                                  *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Why?                                                  *

                    PETER                                       *
          Just trust me.                                        *

She hands him her phone. He leans in for a SELFIE and snaps a   *
photo. He presses a few buttons then shows her the phone.       *

                    PETER (CONT’D)                              *
          That’s your new background.                           *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Okay, but what’s your new                             *
          background?                                           *

He holds up the photo of her with her hair down.                *

                    PETER                                       *
          Already got it.                                       *

Peter’s friend GREG, the kind of guy who will definitely grow   *
up to participate in Santa-Con, opens the door, he’s wasted.

                    GREG
          Welcome to the Jaeger Rager!

Lara Jean looks scared. Peter takes her hand, leads her in.


INT. PARTY - SAME                                               *

Kids are drinking out of solo cups, taking selfies, playing
beer pong. Classic high school stuff. It’s not overly crowded
though - only a certain kind of kid is here.

Gen sits on the couch sipping a beer and staring at Lara
Jean. She whispers something to her best friend EMILY, 17.
Gen likes Emily because she’s funny, pretty but not too
pretty and knows her place.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 61.


                    EMILY
              (calling out)
          Lara Jean! Come sit with us.

                    PETER
          You’ll be fine. I’m gonna get a
          drink.                                                *

Lara Jean walks over to the girls. She perches on the side of
the couch.

                    EMILY
              (to Lara Jean)
          So. Dish. What’s up with you and
          Kavinsky?

Gen looks at Lara Jean out of the corner of her eye, never
straight on. It’s a power move.

                     GEN
          Don’t push, Em.
              (with venom)
          She’s shy.

                    LARA JEAN
              (to Emily, a challenge to
               Gen)
          What do you wanna know?

                    EMILY
          Everything. When? How? How far? H
          on B? H on C? H up and down on P? M
          on P? T on C? OMG T on C??? You
          slut.

                    LARA JEAN
          Whatever happened to the bases?                       *

                    EMILY
          I know, it’s like studying for the
          SAT just trying to figure out how
          far I went at Homecoming last year.                   *

                    GEN
          Forget it, Em. They haven’t done
          anything.

                    LARA JEAN
          How do you know?

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          It’s not that I wanted people to
          think Peter and I were doing stuff.
                    (MORE)

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 62.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But I didn’t like the way Gen said
          we weren’t either.

                     GEN
              (still not looking at her)
          Because I know Peter.
              (finally turning to Lara
               Jean)
          And I know Lara Jean.

Gen stares at Lara Jean. It’s chilling. Gen gets up.            *

                    GEN (CONT’D)
          I need a refill.
              (to Lara Jean)
          Do you want me to get you
          something? Juice Box? Chocolate
          Milk?

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          God. I wish Chris was here to save
          me. Okay, think. What would Chris
          do? What would Chris do?

She’s got it...

                    LARA JEAN
              (to Gen)
          I think Peter was getting me a
          drink actually. But thanks for the
          offer.

Lara Jean gets up and walks over to Peter. He’s sitting on a    *
big chair surrounded by friends. Lara Jean sits on his lap,     *
takes the drink out of his hand, sips it and gives him a kiss   *
on the cheek.

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
          Thanks babe.

She turns to look at Gen who glares at them and walks away.
Once sure she’s gone, she spits the beer back into the cup.     *

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
          Oh god, that’s terrible.


INT. PARTY KITCHEN - LATER

Lara Jean fills a cup with Ginger Ale. Lucas walks up to her,
remember Lucas? From the girl’s bathroom...

                    LUCAS                                       *
          Are you here with Peter Kavinsky?                     *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 63.


                    LARA JEAN
          Odd as it sounds, I am.

                    LUCAS
          Guess something good came out of
          those letters after all?                             *

She looks worried.                                             *

                    LUCAS (CONT’D)
          Don’t worry. I’m not gonna tell
          anyone. But, I mean, that is how
          you got together, right?

                    LARA JEAN
          It’s all pretty crazy.

                    LUCAS
          Yeah. But that’s the fun part,
          right?

He winks at her and starts to leave the room. Before he goes
completely, he turns back around.

                    LUCAS (CONT’D)
          Just watch out for Gen. My money’s
          on you but that girl is a viper and
          I’ve seen the way she still looks
          at him.

                    LARA JEAN
          My guard is firmly up.

                    LUCAS
          Your hair looks pretty like that by
          the way. You never wear it down.


EXT. MCMANSION - BACKYARD - SAME

Peter pisses into a bush. He finishes turns and sees Gen,
she’s clearly drunk.

                    PETER
          Oh, hey. The line for the                            *
          bathroom’s insane.

                    GEN
              (unfazed)                                        *
          Lara Jean Covey. Really?

                    PETER
          What? You don’t like her?

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 64.


                    GEN
          What’s not to like. She’s just a
          sweet little bird. Weak. But sweet.

Peter doesn’t say anything. Gen lifts his wrist where he’s
wearing Lara Jean’s hair tie.

                    GEN (CONT’D)
          Pandas. Cute. This is her’s?

Gen takes the hair-tie off his wrist and puts her hair into a
pony tail with it.

                    GEN (CONT’D)
          How do I look?

                    PETER
          You look good, Gen. You always look
          good. Now give it back.

                    GEN
          No. Ima keep it for awhile.
              (she gets close)
          It’ll be our little secret.

She turns and walks away. He exhales.


INT. PETER’S AUDI - LATER

Peter drives Lara Jean home.                                    *

                    PETER
          You did good tonight. Gen was so                      *
          pissed.                                               *

                    LARA JEAN
          Yeah, well. I just hope she doesn’t                   *
          put glass in my smoothie at lunch
          tomorrow.

                    PETER
          I think it’s cool how you’re not
          afraid of her.

                    LARA JEAN
          Are you kidding? I’m terrified of
          her.

                    PETER
          But you don’t let her steam roll
          you. Like at school how you stood                     *
          up to her when she was being a
          bitch about your shoes.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 65.


                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          You remember that?                                    *

                    PETER
          Course. And I couldn’t say it at                      *
          the time, cause we were dating and
          everything, but I thought those
          boots were hot. Gen’s gorgeous but
          you have way better style.

Was that a compliment or an insult? Or both? She can’t tell.

                    LARA JEAN
          Um, thanks.

They arrive in front of Lara Jean’s house.

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
          Well. Goodnight, I guess.                             *

She’s about to get out when he turns off the car.

                    PETER
          What’s the rush? Chill for a sec.                     *

Peter sits back, settles in, he’s comfortable. Lara Jean sits   *
up straight. Unsure what she’s supposed to do.                  *

                    PETER (CONT’D)
          She just makes me so angry
          sometimes, you know?

                    LARA JEAN
          Who?

                    PETER
          Gen!

                    LARA JEAN
          Oh, we’re still talking about her?

                    PETER
          It’s like tonight. She’s such a                       *
          bitch at the party but then she’s                     *
          texted me like a thousand times
          since we left.

                    LARA JEAN
          She has? Have you been responding?

                    PETER
          Nah. I’ll just call her when I get
          home.

            Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)         66.


          LARA JEAN
    (judgemental)                           *
You guys still talk on the phone?

          PETER
I mean. Not as much as we used to.
But yeah. Sometimes.

          LARA JEAN
Oh.

          PETER
What? What’s that face? You’re
always giving me that judge-y face.

          LARA JEAN
I guess I just think it’s weird you
still talk on the phone to your ex.
It’s like, not healthy.

          PETER
And you’re the expert? You’ve never
even had a boyfriend.

          LARA JEAN
Yeah and you’ve had one girlfriend          *
who has you whipped beyond belief.
You’re not exactly the Bachelor.

          PETER
I’m not whipped.

          LARA JEAN
Prove it. Don’t call Gen tonight.           *

           PETER
    (surprised / impressed)
You know, for someone so quiet, you
can be kind of a pain in the ass
sometimes.

          LARA JEAN
You’re just not used to people
being honest with you. You’re
friends with a bunch of yes men.

          PETER
Okay. Be honest then. Why haven’t
you ever had a boyfriend.

          LARA JEAN
I dunno. I guess cuz no one’s ever
liked me like that.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)         67.


                     PETER
          Bull shit. I know for a fact that           *
          Carlos Myers asked you to Spring
          formal last year and you said no.
          Try again.

She’s not bending. He tries again, softer.            *

                    PETER (CONT’D)                    *
          Come on, Covey. You can talk to me.         *
          We have no secrets. Our own                 *
          personal fight club, remember?              *

She rolls her eyes but then does open up -            *

                    LARA JEAN                         *
          I dunno, dating, love. It’s fun to          *
          read about. And write about and             *
          think about it my head. But when
          it’s real, it’s...I dunno.                  *

                    PETER                             *
          Scary?                                      *

                    LARA JEAN                         *
          Yeah.                                       *

                    PETER                             *
          Why?                                        *

                    LARA JEAN                         *
          Adding people into your life just
          means you have more people to lose.

                    PETER                             *
          Because of your mom?                        *

She’s surprised. He’s paying attention.               *

                    LARA JEAN                         *
          Um. Yeah. Kind of.                          *

                    PETER                             *
              (after a beat)                          *
          Did you know that my dad left us?           *

                    LARA JEAN                         *
          I think I heard that. It was awhile         *
          ago, right?                                 *

                    PETER                             *
          Two summers ago. He has a new wife          *
          and kid now.                                *

                         Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)              68.


                       LARA JEAN                                *
          I’m sorry.                                            *

                    PETER                                       *
              (toughening up)                                   *
          It’s whatever.                                        *

Beat. He shifts gears.                                          *

                    PETER (CONT’D)
          So you say you’re scared of this                      *
          stuff. But you don’t seem scared to                   *
          be with me.                                           *

                    LARA JEAN
          Well, yeah. There’s no reason to                      *
          be.

                       PETER
          Why not?

                    LARA JEAN
          Because this doesn’t mean anything.                   *

                    PETER
          Right. Thanks for being honest.                       *

He seems hurt. She’s confused. They both know this is fake so   *
it shouldn’t be insulting to say it. He starts up the car.      *

                    PETER (CONT’D)                              *
          I gotta get home.                                     *

                       LARA JEAN                                *
          Okay.                                                 *

She gets out but then turns back to him.

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
          Hey. We’re cool, right?                               *

                    PETER
          Course, Covey. Have a good night.

She stands on the sidewalk as he drives away. What the fuck
just happened?


INT. LARA JEAN’S BEDROOM - VANITY - NIGHT

Lara Jean stares at herself in the mirror. She brushes her
hair. Notices how it looks down. Shakes it out. She sees
Kitty behind her in the mirror. She screams.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 69.


                    LARA JEAN
          Kitty. You scared me. I thought                       *
          you’d be asleep.

                    KITTY
          I just wanted to know if you had
          fun.

Lara Jean really considers the question.

                    LARA JEAN
          Yeah. I think I did.

                    KITTY
              (beaming)
          Great! Night.

She sprints down the hall. Lara Jean smirks. It was fun. She
picks up her phone, she texts Peter: THANKS FOR MAKING ME GO.
I HAD FUN.

He texts back: CHECK INSTA.                                     *

She opens Instagram and sees that Peter has posted a photo of   *
Lara Jean sitting on his lap. They are both laughing. The       *
caption says: Me and My Bae.                                    *

She texts him: BAE? You’re such a dork.                         *

He texts back the winking smiley emoji with it’s tongue out.    *
Lara Jean smiles.                                               *


INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH TIME                                     *

Lara Jean sits with Peter and his friends.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          Fake dating Peter became easier and
          easier. I always ate with him in                      *
          the cafeteria now. And was even                       *
          becoming friends with some of his
          friends.

                    GREG
          Hey. Lara Jean. Has anyone ever
          told you that saying your name
          really fast sounds like Large. Try
          it LaraJean LaraJean Larjean.
          Laarrrggeee.

                    LARA JEAN
              (laughing)
          You’re stoned.

                       Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                70.


                    GREG
          I have a respectable buzz for the
          lunching hour, Large. PS - that’s                     *
          your new nickname. It’s funny cuz
          your so small.                                        *

                    LARA JEAN
          They were nothing like my old
          friends.

Josh walks by the cafeteria holding a SCI-FI book on the way    *
to the bleachers. He stops for a second makes eye-contact       *
with Lara Jean.                                                 *

                    GREG
          Ima put you in pocket LARGE!

Greg picks up Lara Jean and swings her around. She laughs.      *
Josh rolls his eyes and keeps walking.                          *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          But it was fun to be part of a
          group.                                                *


INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Peter and Lara Jean walk down the hall, his arm is around
her. Everyone is looking at them.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          It was weird not being invisible
          anymore.


INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Lara Jean has a side fishtail braid. Peter slides her a note.
She opens it, it says: I LIKE YOUR HAIR LIKE THAT.


INT. CLASSROOM - NEXT DAY

                     LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          But it was also kind of cool
          sometimes.

Lara looks around the room. Lots of the other girls now have
side fishtail braids.

                    LARA JEAN
          Of course there were still moments
          I wanted to disappear.

                       Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                   71.


She turns around and sees that Gen is glaring at her. She        *
shrinks down into her seat.                                      *


INT. COVEY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                           *

Lara Jean and Peter watch Sixteen Candles. She looks over at     *
him on the couch. He’s totally comfortable in her house.         *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)                             *
          It wasn’t just in public either.                       *
          Peter was spending more and more                       *
          time at our house.                                     *

                     PETER                                       *
              (still looking at the                              *
               screen)                                           *
          I don’t understand as a half-Asian                     *
          person how you don’t find the                          *
          character Long Duck Dong extremely                     *
          offensive.                                             *

                     LARA JEAN                                   *
          That’s not the important part of                       *
          the story.                                             *

We widen to reveal Kitty on the couch with Lara Jean and         *
Peter.                                                           *

                    KITTY                                        *
          Um, no. It’s so offensive.                             *
              (she point at Lara Jean)                           *
          Part of the problem.                                   *

Peter laughs. So does Kitty, who looks up at Peter with total    *
admiration.                                                      *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)                             *
          I just hoped that Kitty wasn’t                         *
          getting too attached.                                  *


INT. DINER - EVENING

Peter and Lara Jean sit at the diner with menus. Peter looks     *
uncomfortable.                                                   *

                    LARA JEAN                                    *
          Do you wanna order grilled cheese                      *
          and tomato soup and share it?                          *
          That’s what Margot, Josh and I used                    *
          to do.                                                 *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 72.


                     PETER                                    *
              (agitated)                                      *
          So what? I’m just your replacement                  *
          Sanderson?                                          *

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
          That’s not what I said at all.                      *

He fidgets with the menu like he has something to say but     *
doesn’t know how -

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)                        *
          Dude. What is with you today?                       *
          You’re acting so weird.                             *

                    PETER                                     *
          My mom wants you to come over for                   *
          dinner tomorrow.

                    LARA JEAN
          Your mom knows about us?!

                    PETER
          So what? Your sister knows about
          us!

                    LARA JEAN
          Yeah, cuz she met you. I didn’t
          like, tell her...

                    PETER
          Fine don’t come. I’ll tell my mom
          you’re too busy. She’ll think
          you’re a bitch but whatever.

                    LARA JEAN
          Whoa. I never said I wouldn’t come.
          You just surprised me. Dinner with
          your mom sounds nice.

                    PETER
              (relieved)
          Cool. Come over around 7?

                    LARA JEAN
          Um, can you pick me up?

                    PETER
          I thought your car was fixed.

                    LARA JEAN
          Yeah, but...

                         Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)              73.


                    PETER
          Covey. You know you have to start
          driving again sooner or later.                      *

                    LARA JEAN
          But not while I have you, right?

                    PETER
          She only likes me for the rides.

She kicks him under the table. They both smile.


INT. PETER’S KITCHEN -

Peter, Lara Jean, his little brother OWEN, 12 and his mom,
NANCY, 40/50’s sit around his kitchen table. They are all     *
laughing and eating pizza. At one point Peter looks over at
Lara Jean, he smiles at her and blushes.


INT. PETER’S AUDI - NIGHT

Peter drives Lara Jean home.

                    PETER
          My mom really likes you. I can
          tell.

                    LARA JEAN
          I like her too.
              (small beat)
          Is it weird not having your dad
          around?

                    PETER
          Not as weird as it used to be.
          Sometimes I really miss him. But
          then I think about him doing the
          stuff for his new family he used to
          do for us. And it makes me so angry
          that I’m glad he’s gone.

                    LARA JEAN
          You don’t mean that. You can be mad
          at him and still miss him.

                    PETER
          I bet you miss your mom a lot.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 74.


                    LARA JEAN
          I do. Every day. But - and I hope
          this doesn’t make you think less of
          me - it’s been so long now - that
          she’s been gone. That sometimes
          I’ll be doing my homework, or the
          dishes or something - and I think
          about my family and forget there
          was a time it wasn’t just my
          sisters and my dad. It’s only ever
          for like a quarter of a second. But
          whenever it happens. I feel really
          guilty after.
              (small beat)
          I’ve never told anyone that before.
          Not even Margot.

                    PETER
          I get that though. I mean. It makes
          sense to me.
              (small beat)
          And I don’t really hate my dad. I
          shouldn’t have said that. At least
          he’s not, you know...

                    LARA JEAN
          Dead?

                    PETER
          Sorry.

                    LARA JEAN
          Don’t be. It’s nice to have someone
          to talk about this stuff with.
          You’re actually like -- really easy
          to talk to.

                    PETER
          Yeah. So are you.

He looks over at her. She looks at him. They are both quiet -
but it’s not at all awkward.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          Being with Peter was so easy that
          sometimes. But only sometimes...

He reaches over, puts her hair behind her ear, smiles at her.   *

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          ...I let myself pretend it wasn’t
          fake.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 75.


EXT. UNDERNEATH THE BLEACHERS - DAY

Christine and Lara Jean eat subs and drink fountain sodas in   *
SUBWAY cups.                                                   *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          Why do we have to eat under the                      *
          bleachers again?                                     *

                    CHRISTINE                                  *
          Dude. We can’t have these                            *
          contraband Subway cups out in the                    *
          open! Don’t want the powers that be                  *
          catching onto my lunchtime truancy                   *
          vibes. I need my B.M.T’s! PS - that                  *
          sub is tight, right?                                 *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          It tastes like a sub.                                *

                    CHRISTINE                                  *
          So how are things going with my                      *
          cousin’s leftovers?                                  *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          They’re good.                                        *

                    CHRISTINE                                  *
          I don’t understand what you see in                   *
          that guy.                                            *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          He’s actually a lot sweeter than he                  *
          seems from the outside. Like, you                    *
          should see him with Kitty.                           *

                    CHRISTINE
          Well, even if it’s with such a
          basic bro, I’m glad you’re getting
          your rocks off with somebody. It
          was depressing when you used to
          just like, read romance novels on                    *
          the weekends.                                        *

                    LARA JEAN
          I like romance novels.                               *

                    CHRISTINE
          Shh.

Christine puts her hand over Lara Jean’s mouth.

                    LARA JEAN
          It’s not that embarrassing.

                        Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 76.


                    CHRISTINE
              (whispering)
          No, listen. There’s someone up
          there.

Lara Jean and Christine are quiet, we pan up and see -


EXT. BLEACHERS - SAME

Peter and Gen walk onto the bleachers - they are in the
middle of an intense conversation.

                    GEN
          It’s like you don’t have any time
          for me anymore. All you do is hang
          out with her.

Intercut under the bleachers -

                    LARA JEAN
          Let’s get out of here. This sounds
          private.

                    CHRISTINE
          Are you insane, that’s your
          boyfriend! And they’re talking
          about you! We have to listen.

Back on the bleachers -

                    PETER
          What am I supposed to do? Wait
          around like an idiot while you’re
          off screwing some college creep.

                    GEN
          I can’t talk to him like I can talk
          to you. He’s not a good listener.

Underneath the bleachers, Lara Jean winces. That’s the same
thing she said to Peter last night. She’s feeling stupid for
thinking she was special.

                    PETER
          Pssh. That just means he’s not at
          your beck and call like I am. WTF,                    *
          Gen. You can’t just do this to me
          whenever you feel like it!

                    GEN
          She’s not coming on the ski-trip is
          she?

                        Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)               77.


                    PETER
          Why do you care?

                    GEN
          Because that’s our thing. We always
          go together.

                    PETER
          YOU. HAVE. A. BOYFRIEND!

                    GEN
          But...maybe by then...I won’t.

Underneath the bleachers -

                    CHRISTINE
          Dude. Bitch is after your man.                        *


INT. ADLER HIGHSCHOOL - CLASS ROOM                              *

Lara Jean stares at the window as her teacher drones on. She    *
can’t get Gen and Peter’s conversation out of her head.         *

The bell rings. Lara gets up and exits the classroom.           *


INT. ADLER HIGHSCHOOL - HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS                   *

Lara Jean sees Peter at the other end of the hall and walks     *
in the opposite direction before he sees her. She keeps         *
walking until she’s in the -                                    *


EXT. ADLER HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

Lara Jean sees Josh getting into his car. Still steaming from   *
overhearing Peter with Gen, she walks up to Josh.

                       LARA JEAN
          Hey.

                       JOSH
                 (surprised)
          Hi.

                    LARA JEAN
          Can you give me a ride?


INT. JOSH’S CAR - PARKING LOT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Josh and Lara Jean haven’t gone anywhere. They’re sitting in
his car talking.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 78.


                    LARA JEAN
          I guess I feel like, the more used
          to him I get - driving in his car,
          hanging out with his friends, going
          to his parties...the more it’s
          gonna hurt when he and Gen
          inevitably get back together.                        *

                    JOSH
          But you shouldn’t be predicting
          your boyfriend is gonna get back
          together with his ex! That’s crazy.

                    LARA JEAN
          It’s not crazy when it’s Peter and                   *
          Gen. And I guess. I’m mad at myself                  *
          you know? Because like, I knew this                  *
          would happen.                                        *

                    JOSH                                       *
          What do you mean?                                    *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          You let someone in, you lose them,                   *
          and then you miss them.                              *

Josh looks at her. Is she talking about Peter, or him. Both.   *

                    JOSH
          I’m always here for you Lara Jean.                   *
          You know that right?

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          Yeah. But...                                         *

                    JOSH                                       *
          But what?? You know, I feel like                     *
          since Margot broke up with me the                    *
          whole Covey family is like on                        *
          strike against me.                                   *

                    LARA JEAN
          Oh no, Josh. It’s so not that -

                    JOSH                                       *
          So, what is it then?                                 *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          Well, you know, the letter...                        *

                    JOSH                                       *
          The letter? Is that why you’ve been                  *
          avoiding me for months?                              *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 79.


Lara Jean shrugs.                                             *

                    JOSH (CONT’D)                             *
              (quietly)                                       *
          I thought it was because of Peter.                  *

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
          Well, yeah. It’s that too.                          *

                    JOSH                                      *
          Lara Jean. Look at me. I don’t care                 *
          about the letter. We can forget                     *
          about the letter. Okay? I just want                 *
          my friend back.                                     *

Lara Jean looks at Josh. He’s so sweet. He’s so               *
uncomplicated. He’s been her friend for years. He’s willing   *
to forget about the letter. They never have to tell Margot.   *
Is is possible that everything can just go back to normal?    *

A loud banging sound breaks the moment. Lara Jean looks up.   *
Peter is knocking on her window mouthing: “What the hell?”

                    JOSH (CONT’D)
          I can wait.

                    LARA JEAN
          You better not.


EXT. ADLER HIGHSCHOOL - SIDE BUILDING

                    PETER
          Wanna tell me what you were doing
          in Sanderson’s car?                                 *

                     LARA JEAN                                *
          I was just talking to a friend.                     *
          Unlike you - who was practically                    *
          begging Gen to take you back on the                 *
          bleachers.                                          *

                    PETER
          You were spying on me?

                    LARA JEAN
          Not intentionally.                                  *

                    PETER                                     *
          So I was talking to Gen. So what?                   *
          You don’t even post pictures of us                  *
          on Instagram.                                       *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)         80.


                    LARA JEAN                         *
          I don’t want my sister to see them.         *

                    PETER                             *
          Like, Kitty would care.                     *

                    LARA JEAN                         *
          Not, Kitty. Margot. She’d see right         *
          through it and she’s coming home            *
          soon.                                       *

                    PETER
          So?

                    LARA JEAN
          So, we never thought we’d be doing
          this this long. Josh and I are              *
          starting to be cool again and Gen
          is sufficiently jealous. Don’t you
          think it’s time to call it?

                    PETER
          Are you trying to break up with me?         *

                    LARA JEAN
          How could I be breaking up with you
          when we’re not even really
          together?

                    PETER                             *
          This is bullshit! You promised to           *
          go on the ski trip with me. It’s in
          the contract!

                    LARA JEAN
          Only if we were still together!

                    PETER
          We are still together! You’re only
          trying to pull out now because
          you’re scared. I know it.

She freezes. That’s true.
                                                      *

                     LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          How do you tell your fake boyfriend
          you can’t go skiing with him
          because you’re starting to have             *
          real feelings for him? You can’t so         *
          you pivot.                                  *

             I’ll go if Chris goes.


INT. COVEY HOUSE - KITCHEN

Christine is showing Lara Jean’s father her new tattoo. A
TRAMP STAMP that says, FEMINIST. Dr. Covey looks very
uncomfortable.

                       DR. COVEY
             And, um, your parents know about
             this?

                       CHRISTINE
             Duh. My mom got a matching one. You
             see. It’s a statement.

                       DR. COVEY
             It certainly is.

Lara Jean comes in to the kitchen.

                       DR. COVEY (CONT’D)
             Ah! Lara Jean. Great. I’m just
             gonna. Go to another place.

He leaves.

                       CHRISTINE
             So what’s up? Why is your boyfriend
             harassing me about the ski-trip?
             You know I don’t do school
             functions anymore.

                       LARA JEAN
             Oh. Don’t worry about it. I told
             him I would only go if you did.
             Knowing you’d never go.

                       CHRISTINE
             Wait. You have to go. Gen’s                      *
             definitely gonna make a move on
             Peter if you stay home.

                       LARA JEAN
             So let her. I’m tired of feeling
             her snake eyes on me all the time
             anyway -

                       CHRISTINE
             Dude. No. Gen always gets whatever
             she wants and it’s bullshit!

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                   82.

                    CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
          You get Peter. I’ll make sure of
          it. I’m coming on that trip.

                    LARA JEAN
          You know I’m pretty tired of
          everyone using me as some kind of
          pawn to get back at Gen - Peter,
          you - enough! I’m over it.

                    CHRISTINE
          It’s not just that -
              (a rare soft moment from
               Christine)
          Since you’ve been with Peter. Well,
          I dunno, LJ. I’ve never seen you so
          happy. It’s cool.

We hear a LOUD SNIFFLE. Lara Jean turns around. Dr. Covey is
in the doorway, wiping his eyes.

                    DR. COVEY
          Sorry. Sorry. I wasn’t
          eavesdropping but it’s true honey.                    *
          I used to worry about you girls
          taking on too much responsibility
          after your mom died, not getting
          the chance to be kids. But seeing
          you having so much fun this year,
          going to parties, making new
          friends...well, it makes your old
          man very happy. My little girl.

He hugs Lara Jean. He’s losing it. Christine shrugs to Lara
Jean behind her back like, “Dude. Your dad.”

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          Shit.


EXT. ADLER HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING

Dr. Covey drops Lara Jean off for the trip. He hugs her
goodbye and waves to Peter.

                    DR. COVEY
          Try not to let her break her tail
          bone.                                                 *

Snickering behind them a dude whispers to another dude.

                    DUDE #1
          He’ll break her tail bone all
          right.

INT. THE BUS - SAME                                           *

Kids are rowdy on the bus to the ski-trip. Peter sits down,
Lara keeps walking.

                    PETER
          Hey. Where are you going?

                    LARA JEAN
          I’m gonna sit with Chris. She looks
          lonely back there.

Christine is in the back seat, snoring.

                    PETER
          She’s totally passed out. I saw on
          snap she was at some EDM show last
          night with a guy who had spacers
          the size of fist.

                    LARA JEAN
          Even more reason to sit with her.
          Gotta make sure she doesn’t swallow
          her tongue.                                         *

Lara Jean keeps walking. Peter looks up and Gen is standing   *
right in front of him.

                    GEN
          Is this seat taken?

From the back Lara Jean watches Gen sit down next to Peter.   *
Lara Jean turns to Chris.

                    LARA JEAN
          This was a mistake.

                    CHRISTINE
              (coming to)
          Tell me about it. I can’t believe I                 *
          let you convince me to go on a trip                 *
          that requires getting up before                     *
          seven.                                              *

Chris nuzzles into Lara Jean’s shoulders and is quickly       *
asleep. Lara Jean looks up at Gen and Peter. Jealous. What    *
has she done?                                                 *


EXT. SKI LODGE - LATER                                        *

All the kids stand in front of the bus. The lodge is on one   *
side of them and the ski-rental / lift ticket station is on   *
the other. Greg holds court with room assignments and keys.   *

                       Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                84.


                    GREG
          School sanctioned room assignments?
          I don’t think so. Have at it sluts!

He throws the keys to the group who grab at them like wild
animals.


                    LARA JEAN
              (to Christine)
          Where are the chaperones??

                     CHRISTINE
          Probs at the bar already. Only the                    *
          ones who’ve been eye-banging all
          semester in the faculty lounge ever
          sign up for this thing. Don’t you
          remember how Broderick and Hayes
          both got divorced after ski-trip
          last year?

                      LARA JEAN
          What? No!

                    CHRISTINE
          Oh my god. Totes. They’re like the
          Brangelina of the science
          department. PS - RIP Brangelina.

From the other side of the crowd, Gen is decked in expensive    *
ski gear. She calls out to Peter who waits in line for a lift   *
ticket -                                                        *

                    GEN
          See you on black diamonds Peter?
          Last one down the slope owes the
          other a hot toddy?

                    CHRISTINE
              (to Lara Jean)
          Dude. Go get your man.

                    LARA JEAN
          Are you kidding? I can’t handle a
          black diamond! I’d Natasha
          Richardson myself on the bunny
          slopes.                                               *

                    CHRISTINE                                   *
          No one gets that reference. And if                    *
          you’re not gonna ski, what are you                    *
          planning on doing all weekend?                        *

                        Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                85.


She opens her bag and we see a dozen HARLEQUIN ROMANCE         *
NOVELS.                                                        *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          I bought the set on e-bay.                           *

                    CHRISTINE                                  *
          This is a major backslide for you.                   *

Lucas walks past Christine and Lara Jean.                      *

                    CHRISTINE (CONT’D)                         *
          Lucas, can you help me convince                      *
          Lara Jean to ski with us?                            *

                    LUCAS
          Yeah, right. You think I’m risking                   *
          breaking a leg before the musical!                   *
          I’m Albert Peterson for god’s sake!                  *

                       CHRISTINE                               *
          What?                                                *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          Bye Bye Birdie. Duh.                                 *

Chris is flabbergasted like, what is wrong with my friends?    *

                    CHRISTINE                                  *
          You two. Enjoy one another.                          *

She walks away toward the ski-rental station.                  *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          I brought face masks.                                *

                       LUCAS                                   *
          Girl. Yes.                                           *


INT. LARA JEAN AND CHRISTINE’S HOTEL ROOM -                    *

Lucas has changed into a smoking jacket. Lara Jean is in her   *
nightgown. They are eating room service fries.                 *

                    LUCAS
          Wait. So you guys have been
          pretending this whole time??

                    LARA JEAN
          You have to PROMISE not to tell
          anyone. I’m just so confused I
          couldn’t keep it in anymore.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 86.


                    LUCAS
          Pssh. I don’t care what the genesis
          was, homeboy likes you. You can
          tell by the way he looks at you.

                    LARA JEAN
          How does he look at me?

                    LUCAS
          Like you’re his sexy little rubix
          cube - he can’t figure you out but
          he’s having fun trying.

                     LARA JEAN
          Yeah, until he gets bored and
          throws me in a junk drawer next to
          some old cough drops and a rubber
          band ball.

                    LUCAS
          What does that mean?

                    LARA JEAN
          It means he’s still OBSESSED with
          Gen and I’m just another stupid
          girl who fell for Kavinsky. It’s
          embarrassing.

                    LUCAS
          Every guy will also be a little bit
          obsessed with the first girl who
          got their dick wet. But - let’s
          look at the facts, shall we? This
          whole fake relationship was his
          idea, he wouldn’t let you break up
          with him and he begged you to come
          on the ski trip. You’re the one who
          made the no kissing rule. You’re
          the one who keeps trying to end it
          and you’re the one who’s carbo-                      *
          loading with a gay man while he’s                    *
          probably waiting for you in the hot
          tub. I’d say if there’s anyone who
          stupidly fell for someone who
          doesn’t like them back - it’s not
          you, it’s Kavinsky.

Lara Jean looks confused. Could that be true? After a beat -

                    LARA JEAN
          You really think he’s waiting for
          me in the hot tub?

                        Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)               87.


                    LUCAS
          I’d bet a date with Christine Pratt
          on it.

                    LARA JEAN
          I’ve gotta go.

Lara Jean grabs her coat runs out.                              *

Lucas puts on a face mask, leans back, exhales.                 *

After a beat there’s a knock on the door. Lucas answers it,     *
still in his face mask. Christine is there, in her ski-gear.    *

                    CHRISTINE
          Lucas! You’ve been abducted!                          *

                    LUCAS
          It’s a face mask, dummy.                              *

                    CHRISTINE
          Oh. You wanna watch Lemonade?

                       LUCAS
          Obviously.


EXT. HOT TUB - NIGHT

Peter sits alone in the outdoor hot tub. Steam surrounds him.   *
Lara Jean walks out. Still in her white nightgown, but with a   *
jacket over it.

                    LARA JEAN
          You all by yourself out here?                         *

Peter shrugs. Looks away.                                       *



                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
          So what? Now you’re ignoring me?                      *

                    PETER
              (pissed)                                          *
          You think I’m ignoring you? That’s
          rich.

                    LARA JEAN
          Sorry, that I’m not a good skier
          and you didn’t even offer to teach                    *
          me.                                                   *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 88.


                    PETER                                     *
          Right. Because I’m just supposed to                 *
          suddenly be sweet to you after you                  *
          refused to sit next to me on the                    *
          bus.                                                *

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
          Wait. You’re mad I didn’t sit next                  *
          to you on the bus? Are you kidding?                 *
          Shouldn’t you be thanking me that
          you got to sit next to who you
          really wanted.

                    PETER
          You’re who I really wanted to sit
          next to. You know. For someone who                  *
          gets such good grades, you can be
          really dense.
              (small beat)
          I packed us snacks. I asked Kitty
          where to buy those yogurt drinks
          you like. I was gonna surprise you.

                    LARA JEAN
              (still not getting it)                          *
          Really? The Korean grocery that
          sells those yogurts is all the way
          on the other side of town.

                     PETER
               (do you get it yet?)                           *
          I know. So if I went all the way                    *
          there.                                              *
               (small beat)                                   *
          It must be because I really like                    *
          you.                                                *

                    LARA JEAN                                 *
              (kidding)                                       *
          Yeah, or you really like those                      *
          yogurt drinks.                                      *

He smiles, splashes water at her.                             *

                    PETER                                     *
          You’re impossible.                                  *

Lara Jean takes off her jacket, sits on the edge of the hot
tub, dips her feet in the water.                              *

                    LARA JEAN
          Hey. I’m sorry I didn’t sit next to                 *
          you.

          You can sit next to me now...

Lara Jean looks around then gets in next to him.

                    PETER (CONT’D)
          Coming in in your nightgown, eh?

                    LARA JEAN
          Didn’t bring a suit.

                    PETER
          There’s no one like you, Covey.

                    LARA JEAN
          You have foam on your eye brow.

She rubs her thumb along his eye brow to get the foam off.
Now they’re staring at one another. He kisses her. She can’t
help herself. She kisses him back. It’s hot. But then - she       *
stops.                                                            *

                    PETER
          What’s the matter?

                    LARA JEAN                                     *
          Nothing. Just. This is so much                          *
          better than a romance novel.                            *

He kisses her again. More intense this time. She’s loving it.     *
She straddles him, her nightgown billowing around them.           *


INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER

Peter walks Lara Jean to her room. They’re giddy. Holding         *
hands. They keep stopping to kiss. They get to Lara Jean and
Chris’s room. Peter leans her up against the door. Kisses
her one last time.

                    PETER
          Goodnight, Covey.

Lara Jean practically melts into the door. She watches Peter
walk down the hallway then enters her room, ecstatic.


INT. LARA JEAN AND CHRISTINE’S HOTEL ROOM    - CONTINUOUS

Lara Jean enters. Lucas looks up expectantly. (Christine is
passed out).                                                      *

                    LUCAS
          Well?

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                  90.


                    LARA JEAN
              (giddy)
          It’s real! It’s really real!!!


INT. BUS - THE NEXT DAY

Lara Jean walks onto the bus. Everyone starts clapping and
hooting. She sees Greg fist-bump Peter. She looks concerned,
she slides in next to Peter.

                    LARA JEAN
          Hey. You didn’t tell anyone about
          last night did you?

                    PETER
          Course not. This is always how
          people act with couples on the ski-
          trip. I’m sleepy, be my pillow.

He rests his head on her shoulder and closes his eyes.

In the front of the bus, Emily gets on with Gen. They see
Peter sleeping on Lara Jean’s shoulder.

                    EMILY
          They don’t look broken-up.

                    GEN
          Whatever. Who cares.

                    EMILY
          But you said you were getting back
          together with Peter this weekend.

                    GEN
          I don’t remember that.

                    EMILY
          Yes, we snapped it remember. You
          said -

Emily starts to take out her phone.

                    GEN
          Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

Gen throws Emily’s phone across the bus. Emily looks at it.
They are both quiet and deadpan. Then -

                    GEN (CONT’D)                               *
          Sorry.                                               *

                       Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                91.


                    EMILY
          Um, yeah, that’s okay. It was just                  *
          a four, I need an upgrade anyway.                   *


EXT. ADLER HIGHSCHOOL - PARKING LOT

Lara Jean grabs her suitcase from underneath the bus. Gen
walks up to her.

                    GEN
              (too nice)
          It’s so cool you came on ski trip
          this year, Lara Jean. I hope you
          had fun.

                      LARA JEAN
          I did.

                    GEN
          Also, I wanted to say, it’s really
          big of you to be so understanding
          about my friendship with Peter.

                      LARA JEAN
          Um. What?

                    GEN
          Well, I mean. Lots of girls would
          be weirded out by their boyfriend
          sleeping in someone else’s room.
          But you’re so trusting. I remember
          that about you from middle school.

                    LARA JEAN
          Sorry, what are you talking about?

                    GEN
          Last night. Peter came to my room
          really late. He was soaking wet. I
          think he must’ve just gotten out of
          the hot tub.

Lara Jean’s eyes get wide.

                    GEN (CONT’D)
          Don’t worry. Nothing happened.
              (she smiles as if to say,
               don’t believe that)
          Ugh. Doesn’t your hair always feel
          so greasy after getting off a bus
          for three hours.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                    92.


Gen puts her hair into a ponytail with LARA JEAN’S PANDA HAIR
TIE.

                    LARA JEAN
          Where did you get that?

                    GEN
          Oh this? Peter gave it to me. Isn’t
          it cute? I love the pandas.

Lara Jean sees Peter walking towards her. She turns and
starts walking in the opposite direction.

                    PETER
          Hey, Lara Jean. Wait up.                               *

She starts running away but he catches up with her. Grabs her
shoulder. She turns.

                    LARA JEAN
          Did you go to Gen’s room last
          night?

Peter pauses. He doesn’t know what to say.

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
          Oh my god. I’m so stupid.

                    PETER
          Calm down. You don’t understand.

                    LARA JEAN
          I understand perfectly. And just so
          you do too -

She pulls the CONTRACT out of her pocket and TEARS IT TO
PIECES.

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
          Get it? We are OVER. In every way
          possible.

A group of people have started crowding around them -

                    PETER
              (stepping towards her)
          Can we talk about this privately?
          Let me drive you home...

                    LARA JEAN
          I’d rather walk. No, I’d rather
          drive myself than get in a car with
          you right now.

                        Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 93.


Lara Jean storms off. After a beat, Gen walks up to Peter.
Puts her arm around him.

                    GEN
          Guess that’s the thing with little
          birds. It’s so easy to ruffle their
          feathers.


INT. COVEY HOUSE - FOYER - IT’S DECORATED FOR CHRISTMAS

Lara Jean walks in with her bags from the trip. She’s
exhausted and depressed.

                       LARA JEAN
          Hello?

Kitty runs out.

                    KITTY
          Guess who came home early?!

Margot rounds the corner.

                       LARA JEAN
          OH MY GOD.

Lara Jean practically falls on Margot hugging her.

                    MARGOT
              (laughing)
          Hi, Sis. It’s nice to see you too.                    *
          Maybe we can have more than a two-                    *
          minute conversation now?                              *

Lara Jean looks a little guilty but it’s trumped by how happy   *
she is to see Margot.                                           *


INT. COVEY HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

The girls pile around the kitchen island.                       *

                    KITTY                                       *
          We want to hear everything about
          Scotland!

                    LARA JEAN
          Wait! We need cookies for this.

Lara Jean gets cookies from the cabinet.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)             94.


                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
          Okay what kind do you want - we’ve
          got snickerdoodles, chocolate chip,
          ginger snap, sugar pecan...                     *

                    MARGOT
          Wait, did you guys make all the
          Christmas cookies without me?

                    LARA JEAN
          Well...we just wanted to make sure
          we had time to do all of them.

                    MARGOT
          But you put up the tree without me
          too.

                    LARA JEAN
          Kitty didn’t want to wait.

                    KITTY
          You didn’t want to wait either,
          Covey.

                    MARGOT
          When did you start calling her
          Covey?

                    KITTY
          That’s what Peter calls her.

                    MARGOT
          Who the hell is Peter??

Lara Jean gives Kitty a look that says “not now”.

                    MARGOT (CONT’D)
          I thought you guys would be excited
          for me to come home instead you did
          everything fun without me and are
          making secret eye contact. Do you               *
          even care that I’m home? I might as             *
          well have just stayed in Scotland!              *

Margot exits in a huff.

                    KITTY
          What’s the matter with her?

                     LARA JEAN
          Jet lag?

                    KITTY
          More like psychosis.

                                                         95.


                    LARA JEAN
          Thanks for not telling her about
          Peter.

                    KITTY
          Don’t think you’re gonna be able to
          hide it much longer.

Kitty motions to the kitchen door, where Peter is standing.


EXT. COVEY HOUSE - NIGHT

Lara Jean stands with Peter and protectively pulls her
sweater tighter around her.

                    PETER
          Nothing happened between me and Gen
          last night. She just wanted to
          talk.

                    LARA JEAN
          And you just do whatever she wants.

                    PETER
          It’s not like that. It’s
          complicated. Gen and I were
          together for a long time. Those
          feelings don’t just go away.

                    LARA JEAN
          Hey. I get it. But I’m over being
          second best. Or fake best. Or
          whatever this is.

                    PETER
          You don’t get it at all.
              (small beat)
          Last night was...

                    LARA JEAN
          Last night was a mistake. I know
          none of the physical stuff is a big
          deal to you. But it is to me.

                    PETER
          Who says it’s not a big deal to me?

                    LARA JEAN
          Everyone on the bus was high-fiving
          you like you’re some kind of god.
          And you were eating it up.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                  96.


                    PETER
          Can we please just go inside and
          talk about this? You don’t                            *
          understand.                                           *

                    LARA JEAN
          I can’t invite you in. It’s
          Margot’s first night back. Family
          only.

Through the window, Peter sees Josh walk into the kitchen and
get a cookie.

                    PETER
          Family only, huh?

                    LARA JEAN
          That’s what I said.

                    PETER
          Than what the hell is Sanderson
          doing here?!

Peter storms into the house. Lara Jean runs after him.

                    PETER (CONT’D)
              (yelling)
          This isn’t about me and Gen at all!
          This is about you and Josh! He’s
          the real reason you broke up with
          me! You’re still in love with this
          Final Fantasy ass hat!

Margot walks into the kitchen, she’s been in the next room
the whole time.

                    MARGOT
          What is Peter Kavinsky doing in our
          kitchen? And what does he mean
          you’re in love with Josh?

                    LARA JEAN
          It’s not what it sounds like.

                    JOSH
              (to Peter)
          I prefer Dungeons and Dragons ass
          hat, actually, and if Lara Jean
          broke up with you it’s probably
          because she realized she’s too good
          for you. Something the rest of us
          have known all along.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 97.


                    PETER
          That’s it Sanderson. You and me.
          Outside.

                    MARGOT
              (to Lara Jean, near tears)
          You ignore me all semester and now
          I find out you’re dating some jock
          and you after my boyfriend? Who are                   *
          you?? Are you even my sister?

Margot runs out of the room, crying.

                    LARA JEAN
              (to Peter)
          Go home, Peter.

He pauses then -

                    PETER
          You were never second best.

He exits. Josh turns to Lara Jean.

                    JOSH
              (re: Margot)
          I wasn’t gonna tell her about the
          letter.

                    LARA JEAN
          Thanks.

Josh leaves too.


INT. LARA JEAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

She lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          Things couldn’t possibly get any                      *
          worse.

Lara Jean’s phone dings.

TEXT: Christine: IS THIS YOU?!?!?

Lara Jean presses play on an Instagram video. It’s a blurry
loop of her and Peter making out in the hot tub. She’s
straddling him and her nightgown is billowing around them. IT
LOOKS LIKE THEY’RE HAVING SEX.

CAPTION: GOOD GIRL GONE BAD. PETER K SWIPES LARA JEAN’S V
CARD IN THE HOT TUB ON SKI TRIP.

                                                        98.


Lara Jean SCREAMS.

The SCREAM reverberates through the house and neighborhood.


INT. COVEY HOUSE - BASEMENT

Dr. Covey and Kitty play checkers. The house shakes with Lara
Jean’s scream. Kitty looks at her dad.

                      KITTY
            Women. Am I, right?


INT. MARGOT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lara Jean comes into Margot’s bedroom with tears streaming
down her face.

                      LARA JEAN
            I need your help.


TIME CUT:

Margot watches the video. Lara Jean sits on the edge of her
bed.

                      LARA JEAN
            How bad is it?

                      MARGOT
            Well, you’re completely covered up
            and we only see your back so if
            they hadn’t tagged you, it could be
            anyone. It’s actually worse for
            Peter than for you.

                      LARA JEAN
            It’s never worse for the guy.

Lara Jean buries her face in Margot’s pillow. Margot strokes
her head.

                      MARGOT
            Hey, it’s okay. We’ll figure it
            out.

                      LARA JEAN
            You’re only being nice now because
            I accidentally made a sex tape and
            you feel bad for me.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                 99.


                    MARGOT
          I do feel bad for you but I also
          don’t understand why you didn’t
          just tell me all of this was going
          on in the first place. So what if
          you liked Josh in middle school?
          When I heard what Peter said, I
          thought you were trying to like
          date him now or something. Like
          that’s why you wouldn’t talk to me
          while I’ve been away.                                *

                    LARA JEAN
          How could you think I would do that
          to you? I’m your sister.

                    MARGOT
          But you wouldn’t even skype with
          me! What am I supposed to think?

                    LARA JEAN
          I wouldn’t skype with you because I
          was lying to everyone and I knew I
          couldn’t lie to you.

                    MARGOT
              (starting to cry)
          But I thought you didn’t need me
          anymore!

                    LARA JEAN
              (also starting to cry)
          Are you kidding? I need you so
          much! Don’t you see what happened
          to me without you? I made a sex
          tape! And I’ve never even had sex!

                    MARGOT
          I love you and I missed you so
          much.

                    LARA JEAN
          No. I love you and I missed you so
          much.

Margot and Lara Jean are both crying and hugging each other.   *
Kitty stands in the doorway, she’s also crying. Margot and
Lara Jean look over at her.

                    MARGOT                                     *
          Why are you crying?

                    KITTY
          Because I love you guys too.

                        Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)              100.


                       LARA JEAN
          Come here.

Kitty gets into their group hug.

                    MARGOT
          Let’s make a pact. No more secrets
          between the Covey girls.                            *

Kitty lets out a HUGE WAIL.

                    LARA JEAN
          Kitty. That’s a little over the top
          for just feeling the love.

                    KITTY
              (sobbing)
          I have a secret too!!!
              (between sobs)
          I sent the letters.

Lara Jean’s eyes get wide. SHE WHAT????

                    LARA JEAN
              (screaming)
          I’m gonna KILL YOU!!!

Lara Jean pounces on Kitty. Margot tears them off of one-
another.

                     MARGOT
          Oh my god. Lara Jean. Stop! She’s
          only nine.

                    LARA JEAN
          You’re gonna die!!!!

                    KITTY
          You just seemed so lonely! And I
          could tell Peter liked you and I
          knew you wouldn’t do anything about
          it! It was for your own good!

                    LARA JEAN
          Then why did you send ALL of them?

                    KITTY
          I figured five chances at a
          boyfriend was better odds.

                    LARA JEAN
          But JOSH???

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)          101.


                    KITTY
          I missed having him come over for
          dinner.

                    MARGOT
              (to Lara Jean)
          Her logic is off but her heart was
          in the right place.

                    LARA JEAN
          Her ass is gonna be in wrong place.

                    MARGOT                              *
          Before you kill our sister. Can I             *
          ask you something.                            *
              (small beat)                              *
          If you really, truly never wanted             *
          the letters to be sent. Why did you           *
          address them?                                 *

Beat. Lara Jean has to really think about them          *

                    LARA JEAN                           *
              (sadly)                                   *
          It’s not like I added a stamp.                *

                    MARGOT                              *
          Can you admit that maybe, there was           *
          a part of you. Who doesn’t want               *
          everything in your life to be a               *
          fantasy?                                      *

                    LARA JEAN                           *
              (still crying)                            *
          Why are you so smart It’s so                  *
          annoying!                                     *

                    MARGOT
          Now look, if I forgive you for                *
          writing my boyfriend a love letter,           *
          do you think you can forgive Kitty            *
          for sending it?                               *

                    LARA JEAN
          I feel like I’m getting the shit
          end of this deal.

                    MARGOT
          Mommy would want you to forgive
          her.

                    LARA JEAN
          Way to play the dead mom card.
              (to Kitty)
                    (MORE)

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                102.

                    LARA JEAN (CONT'D)
          I forgive you, but you owe me braid
          crowns whenever I want them all
          year.

                    KITTY
          Thank god. I was really hoping to
          make it to double digits.                           *


INT. COVEY HOUSE - CHRISTMAS MORNING                          *

Lara Jean, Margot, Kitty and Dr. Covey open gifts.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          It was a weird Christmas knowing my
          hot tub escapades had become the
          “One Night in Paris” of Adler High.


INT. MARGOT’S BEDROOM - DAY

Margot types on Lara Jean’s phone.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          But of course, Margot knew exactly                  *
          what to do and anonymously e-mailed
          Instagram to have them take the
          video taken down under child
          pornography laws. I couldn’t
          believe I’d inadvertently dabbled
          in porn before I’d even lost my
          virginity. But it’d been a strange
          year all around.


INT. MOVIE THEATER - CONCESSIONS

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          I avoided Peter over break.

Lara Jean stands in line for popcorn. She looks down at her
phone. Peter is calling. She presses IGNORE.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          And things were largely back to the
          way they were before this fall even
          happened.

Margot and Josh walk up to Lara Jean.

                    JOSH
          Popcorn and Sour Patch kids?

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                103.


                    MARGOT
          Popcorn and Raisinettes! Lara Jean,
          your vote decides it -

But she’s still looking at her phone where we see that she
has five (5) missed called from Peter.

                    LARA JEAN
          Sure, guys. Cherry Icees are fine
          with me.

Josh and Margot give each other a look. Margot puts her hand
on Lara Jean’s arm.

                    MARGOT
          Why don’t you just talk to him?

Lara Jean brushes her off.

                    LARA JEAN
          I don’t know what you’re talking
          about.


INT. LARA JEAN’S BEDROOM - NEW YEAR’S EVE

Lara Jean ORGANIZES HER SOCK DRAWER. She opens Instagram.       *
Sees photos of a crazy party at Greg’s: Peter’s there. Gen is   *
there. She looks down at her SOCK DRAWER, frowns. Dr. Covey     *
walks by her room -

                    DR. COVEY
          No parties tonight?

                    LARA JEAN
          I’d been neglecting my sock drawer.                   *
          It was really unorganized.                            *

                    DR. COVEY
          Honey, why don’t you just talk to
          him?

                    LARA JEAN
          I don’t know who you mean.

                    DR. COVEY
          Wanna come watch the ball drop with
          me and Kitty at least?                                *

                    LARA JEAN
          No thanks, can you just close the
          door?

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                   104.


He does. She opens her phone back up and scrolls through
photos of her and Peter. She sighs. She’s about to text him -
HAPPY NEW YEAR then stops herself. Deletes the text.


INT. ADLER HIGHSCHOOL - HALLWAYS - DAY                           *

Lara Jean walks down the hall with Chris and Lucas.              *

                    LUCAS
          No one’s mentioned the video?

                    CHRISTINE
          If they do, I’ll kick their ass.

                    LARA JEAN
          I think it’s blown over actually.
          It’s a New Year and I’m officially                     *
          back to being invisible.

Jus then, they turn the corner see that STILLS FROM THE VIDEO    *
are taped over everyone’s lockers.                               *

On Lara Jean’s own locker “IT’S ALWAYS THE ONES YOU NEVER        *
EXPECT” is written in spray paint.                               *

Tears start to well in Lara Jean’s eyes. Chris and Lucas         *
quickly tear down as many of the photos as they can.             *

                    LUCAS
          Just try and ignore it.                                *

From behind she hears TWO GUYS start making sex noises.          *

                    GUY #1                                       *
          Oh yeah, Peter. Give it to me
          harder!

Tears spill from Lara Jean’s cheeks as she runs down the         *
hallway towards the bathroom, not looking where she’s going,     *
she runs right into Peter.                                       *

                    PETER
          Lara Jean. What’s wrong?

                    LARA JEAN                                    *
          You didn’t even tell anyone it                         *
          wasn’t true! You just let everyone                     *
          think we had sex in that hot tub                       *
          when you know that we didn’t.
          You’re probably happy that video                       *
          was leaked.                                            *

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                   105.


She pushes past him. He looks down the hallway and sees          *
everyone looking at him. Then, he sees the posters.              *

Christine and Lucas look at him with disgust. Peter addresses    *
the whole hallway.                                               *

                    PETER
          Hey! Everybody listen up. Nothing
          happened in that hot tub. And even
          if it did, which it didn’t. It’d be
          none of your damn business. If I
          hear anyone slut shame Lara Jean or                    *
          say anything about that video ever                     *
          again, I’ll kick all of your asses.
          Do you understand?

The whole hallway goes quiet.                                    *

                    CHRISTINE                                    *
              (sarcastic)                                        *
          Nice job, Kavinsky. That really de-                    *
          escalated the situation.                               *

Peter walks up to Lara Jean with sorry eyes...                   *

                    PETER
              (to Lara Jean)
          I really am sorry. For everything.                     *
              (small beat)                                       *
          If I knew who put that video up...

Lara Jean stares at her locker: IT’S ALWAYS THE ONES YOU         *
DON’T EXPECT.                                                    *

                    LARA JEAN                                    *
              (realizing)                                        *
          I know who put it up. And thanks,                      *
          but this is a fight I have to fight                    *
          myself.


INT. GIRL’S BATHROOM - SAME                                      *

Gen washes her hands at the sink. Lara Jean walks right up to
her.

                    GEN
          Um. Hi? Personal space, much?

                    LARA JEAN
          I know you posted that video.

            Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)          106.


          GEN
It wasn’t me. But just so you know -
if you’re gonna have sex in a                 *
public place, you’ve gotta deal
with the consequences.

          LARA JEAN
You know, it would be bad enough if
a guy did this. But knowing that
another girl did it, is truly
despicable.

          GEN
Like I said, I didn’t do it. But              *
I’m glad someone did. Because it
finally shows everyone who you
really are.

          LARA JEAN
What are you talking about?

          GEN
High school is just a bunch of
people wearing masks, right? People
pretend to be something they’re not
for attention or to survive or
whatever. Emily’s not as dumb as
she pretends to be. Peter’s not as
confidant as he pretends to be. I’m
not as tough as I pretend to be.
And you, Lara Jean Covey, are not
as innocent as you pretend to be.

          LARA JEAN
Tough? That’s how you’d describe
yourself? I think most people would
have another word for it and it
rhymes with Mitch.

          GEN
That’s exactly what I’m talking
about! You want everyone to think
you’re so sweet. But you’re
actually the word that rhymes with
pitch because you’re the one who
KISSED THE BOY I LIKED!

          LARA JEAN
You were broken up!! You don’t own
him.

          GEN
No! Before. Before we even dated.

                        Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)               107.


QUICK FLASH:   2011. Lara Jean spins the bottle, it lands on
Peter.

                    LARA JEAN
          Wait. Are you talking about middle
          school?

                    GEN
          You knew I liked him and you kissed
          him anyway.

                    LARA JEAN
          It was spin-the-bottle you psycho.
          And it was tongueless!

                    GEN
          It wasn’t tongueless to me!

Gen storms out of the bathroom, very upset.

                    LARA JEAN (V.O.)
          Things I know from that
          conversation: #1: Gen 100% posted
          that video. #2: She is most
          definitely not as tough as she
          pretends to be. #3: Is it possible
          that the reason Gen and I stopped                    *
          being friends is because she was
          jealous of me?

A teacher walks out of one of the stalls where she’s been
peeing.

                    TEACHER
          Why didn’t you guys just say bitch?


INT. COVEY HOUSE - MARGOT’S BEDROOM - EVENING

Lara Jean helps Margot pack.

                    LARA JEAN
          I can’t believe you’re leaving
          again tomorrow.
              (small beat)
          Can I ask you something?

                       MARGOT
          Of course.

                    LARA JEAN
          Did you stop loving Josh when you
          broke up with him?

                       Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)               108.


                    MARGOT
              (thinking about it)
          I guess I’ll always love Josh a
          little bit. But at some point the
          love changed. I outgrew him, I                       *
          guess. Does that make sense?

Lara Jean is quiet.

                    MARGOT (CONT’D)
          Why? Do you think you still
          might...have feelings for Peter?                     *

Lara Jean gulps and nods, holding back tears.                  *

                    MARGOT (CONT’D)
          You have to talk to him, LJ. No                      *
          more contracts. No more games. Just
          honestly tell him how you feel.

                      LARA JEAN
          I can’t.

                      MARGOT
          Why not?

                    LARA JEAN
          Because if it wasn’t real, then I                    *
          didn’t really lose anyone. I can                     *
          tell myself it didn’t matter. But
          if I say it’s real and he still
          doesn’t want me...

She wipes away a tear. Margot puts her hand on her shoulder.

                    MARGOT                                     *
          Then at least you’ll know.                           *

                    LARA JEAN
          Anyway, I’m tired of writing love
          letters. For once it’d be nice to
          be the person who receives one.

Kitty comes in. Her hands are behind her back.

                    KITTY
              (to Lara Jean)
          I have something for you. Call it a
          belated Christmas gift.

Kitty takes the TEAL HAT BOX from behind her back. It’s
filled with ALL THE NOTES Peter sent Lara Jean this year.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                109.


                    KITTY (CONT’D)
          I just thought...these were
          something you should save.

Lara Jean leafs through them. Some are innocuous. “Wanna get    *
smoothies after school? My treat.” And some are more special:   *
“You looked so pretty today”. Margot picks one up and reads     *
it aloud.                                                       *

                    MARGOT                                      *
              (reading)                                         *
          Thanks for coming to the game on                      *
          Friday. I always play better when I                   *
          know you’re there.                                    *

                    KITTY                                       *
              (reading)                                         *
          Everyone was so impressed by your                     *
          presentation in Lit. But especially                   *
          me. Love having a smarty-pants GF.                    *

Lara Jean picks one up.                                         *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
              (reading)                                         *
          It’s cool how we can talk to each                     *
          other about the real stuff.                           *

She looks up. She really misses him.                            *

                    MARGOT                                      *
          Still think you’ve never gotten a                     *
          love letter?                                          *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          But what can I do? I messed it all                    *
          up. He probably hates me now.                         *

                    MARGOT
          I hate to be a nag...

                    KITTY
          No you don’t.

                     MARGOT
              (to Lara Jean)
          But maybe you should talk to him.
              (small beat)                                      *
          In person.                                            *

                    LARA JEAN                                   *
          Will you drive me?                                    *

                         Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)              110.


                       MARGOT                                   *
             No.                                                *

INSPIRATION MUSIC IN:                                           *


INT. COVEY HOUSE - FOYER - SAME                                 *

Lara Jean stares down the CAR KEYS hanging on a hook.

She takes a deep breath and grabs them.


EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

Inside the car it feels like Lara Jean is going a hundred
miles an hour. Music blasts. She’s sweating.

Outside the car, music stops, we see she’s actually going       *
below the speed limit. The car inches along.

But it’s all about how it feels! So - music back in! Inside,    *
she’s flying. She truly is a terrible driver. But she’s doing   *
it.


EXT. PETER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Lara Jean pulls up in front of Peter’s house. She stops the
car.

MUSIC OUT.                                                      *


INT. LARA JEAN’S CAR - SAME

Lara Jean scrawls something onto a piece of paper.


EXT. PETER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Lara Jean gets out of her car. She hesitantly walks to
Peter’s door. Knocks. He answers, looks surprised to see her.

                       PETER
             Hi.

                       LARA JEAN
             Hi.

                       LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
             I have to tell you something.

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                111.


                    PETER
          Okay.

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          I’m driving again. Just thought
          you’d want to know. Okay, Bye.

She starts to walk away, shaking her head. He calls after her- *

                    PETER
          Hey! What’s that paper in your
          hand?

                    LARA JEAN
              (thinking fast)
          My car insurance. In case you
          wanted proof of the driving thing.

                    PETER
          So lemme me see how good your rate
          is. Maybe I’ll switch.

He grabs for the letter. He starts to open it. Then gives it   *
back to her.                                                   *

                    PETER (CONT’D)                             *
          Actually, no.                                        *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          What do you mean?                                    *

                    PETER                                      *
          If you want me to have this. You                     *
          have to give it to me yourself.                      *

Beat. She makes a decision.                                    *

                    LARA JEAN                                  *
          Close your eyes.                                     *

He looks at her skeptically.                                   *

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)                         *
          Just do it.                                          *

She opens the letter, starts to read. Her voice is shaky at    *
first, but grows more powerful as she goes.                    *

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)                         *
          Dear Peter, I need you to know,
          even if you knowing is the only
          thing that comes out of it. Even if
          we never talk again.
                    (MORE)

                         Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)      112.

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
          Even if you get back together with
          Gen tomorrow. I need you to know
          that I like you. And the reason I
          broke up with you is because I was
          scared that I liked you too much.
          And you didn’t feel the same. And            *
          also. Because I thought you told             *
          everyone we had sex. And because
          you went to Gen’s room after we had
          that moment, that really was an
          amazing moment, despite being the
          catalyst for that video. Which was
          terrible but I’m guess I’m trying
          to say that even with the video.             *
          Even with the Gen stuff. Even if I           *
          end up losing you. I wouldn’t give           *
          up the moment. Because it was real.          *

Beat. He’s staring at her.                             *

                    LARA JEAN (CONT’D)
          Well. What do you think?                     *

                    PETER
          The writing seems rushed. Lots of
          run-ons. Format wise, not your best          *
          work.

She looks heartbroken.

                    PETER (CONT’D)
          But the content...was awesome.

He smiles but she’s still unsure.                      *

                    LARA JEAN
          Well, yeah. That’s what I needed to
          say and I said it so I guess I
          should go now.

                    PETER
          Hey, wait. Can I say something now?          *
              (small beat)                             *
          I went to Gen’s room that night to
          tell her things were over for good.

                    LARA JEAN
          Seems like weird timing -

                    PETER
          Stop. My turn. I went to Gen’s room
          that night to tell her things were
          over for good because...

                      Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)                  113.


He stops. He’s scared. She looks at him. What is Peter
Kavinsky so scared of?

                    PETER (CONT’D)
          ...because I love you.                                *

She’s shocked.

                    LARA JEAN
          Love?

                    PETER
          Yeah. Love.

Before she knows what she’s doing she’s kissing him. He’s
kissing her back. It’s hot. But then she stops.

                    LARA JEAN
          Wait. How do we do this?

                    PETER
          How do we do what?

                    LARA JEAN
          How do we have a contract for a
          real relationship?                                    *

                    PETER
          We can’t.
              (small beat, smiles)
          We just have to trust it.

She smiles. They kiss again.                                    *

                            THE END.

Valley Girl
   By Andrew Lane




      Page 1/37

They're playing at the Hollywood Bowl
tonight, sold out.
We'll be giving away six more tickets
this morning. 75 degrees in Hollywood.
You've been listening to an hour of nonstop
power rock 'n' roll, on HollyPower 92.
- There's more.
- At the top of the hour...
here in the Valley, it's a balmy 83 degrees.
Gotta go, but first...
here's the story of my life.
I don't want to, like, start a family.
I'd get all puffed out to the max
and all, for sure!
Oh, God, gag me. How could you?
Sure, I'd be freaking-
I'd be scarfing up everything in sight.
I'm sure. I don't know.
I'd get so fat and all,
and what would happen to my zits?
They can get so grody.
And besides, it's totally gnarly birth control.
He's not so awesome.
Awesome's not the word for Brad.
- Oh, I'm sure.
- He's okay, I guess.
Who am I kidding?
He makes my mouth water.
Brad'll be at my party tonight.
Great, that'll attract every girl
west of Van Nuys Boulevard.
Your place will be packed.
Okay, so he's awesome!
God, Julie, don't be so greedy.
You know, save some for the rest of us.
Tommy is such a hunk, I can't stand it.
I mean, he is so bitchin'.
I can't even believe
you'd give Brad the time of day.
But Tommy can be such a dork, you know?
Like, he's got the bod,
but his brains are bad news.
But he is bitchin'.
You really are so lucky, Julie.


                                 Page 2/37

I know, but we've been going together
so long now.
I'm beginning to think I'm a piece
of furniture or something, like an old chair.
Total bad news.
I definitely need something new.
...bags off at home and hit the beach, okay?
Let's do that.
- Sounds good.
- Julie, like-
I hate these escalators.
Guys, we won't have time
to get ready for my party.
Yes, we will.
What a surprise finding you here.
Should I be at home,
waiting for the phone to ring?
I could grow old and prune up,
waiting for that.
Funny. What's your problem?
What's my problem?
Try two days and no phone calls.
I'll see you guys at the bus.
- Okay.
- That's all right.
I'm totally not in love with you
anymore, Tommy.
I mean, it's so boring.
Here.
Not too cool, Julie. I won't be bummed out.
Who else is there?
No other Val dude can touch me.
She must be really freaking out.
- I want a corn dog.
- I want a pizza.
- Diet Pepsi with French fries.
- Those are totally fattening!
I got it.
- I'm sure!
- Diet Pepsi's diet.
It'll be a great party night.
Everyone will be there.
Pass on cotillion just this once, okay?
My mom would kill me


                                 Page 3/37

if she found out I'd skipped out on it.
Look, this is the social event of the season.
Don't be dull.
- Where does she live?
-23727 Sierra Vista.
I'm sure. Move.
The best guys will be there.
It'll be totally hot.
- That guy is so cute!
- He is.
- Look at him!
- He smiled.
- You guys...
- His hair-
- Look how hairy that guy's back is.
- Gross!
The guy has fur all over his face, too.
My God!
What a hunk!
Oh, God, check out those pecs!
I'd go for that in a minute. For sure.
He's hot!
- He's my kind of guy.
- Aren't they all?
Most of them are.
They didn't have corn dogs, so I got-
I hate...
Hey, man, 23727 Sierra Vista.
It's a party. It is going to be amazing.
I've seen the chicks.
I know about these things.
I got a feeling about this.
It's going to be hot. I'm telling you.
And it's in the Valley.
What?
- The party's in the Valley.
- I don't want to go to the Valley.
- Trust me, I know-
- I don't want to go to the Valley.
I'm not in the mood to go there.
Come on, Julie. You know Loryn
won't let her mom wait for us.
She'll want to pounce
on the first available bod.


                                 Page 4/37

God. Hey, do you think
she does everything she says?
I don't know. She'll get in a lot of trouble,
though, if she doesn't watch out.
I think she does.
Who could make up,
""That stuff tastes like Clorox""?
God, gross me out!
I don't know.
I think she's lonely, you know?
When does she have the time?
- She's got problems.
- Yeah. Hormones, I guess.
- No, that's when you grow a mustache.
- Puke! Gross!
I don't know,
it's up to us to look out for her.
She is our friend.
She'd do the same thing for us.
I guess.
Okay.
- Hold still.
- God, what am I going to do?
Tommy's going to be there.
You know how he is.
He's not going to appreciate
me talking to Brad.
Get real. You're not
going through with this, are you?
I'm so sure! Brad's totally hot.
I think he's totally not.
- God, I'm so nervous.
- Okay, let's go!
- We're taking off now, guys.
- Don't you two look great!
Stacey, if I were 20 years younger, honey...
God, Dad! I won't be too late, I'm sure.
We don't want to pressure you, dear.
Just let us hear from you by next Tuesday,
okay, honey?
I'm not going away on a peace march
or something heavy like that, Pop.
- I can dig the scene. No sweat.
- I have to be home by 1:00.


                                 Page 5/37

We try to give Julie all the space she needs.
I know, Mom.
- 'Bye. Have a good time.
- 'Bye.
- Bye-bye.
- Have a good time.
Sarah, do you know
how much she looks like you?
I mean, you were just her age
when I met you.
Do I still look that way?
Better.
But things were sure a lot wilder then.
Different priorities, that's all.
Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.
I tell you what.
You spend the night at my house, okay?
We'll take his mother's car...
Sounds good.
- Forget about her, Tommy.
- Don't worry about it.
Brad?
- Great party.
- It's all right.
Do you like the music?
It's okay.
- Have you tried the sushi yet?
- No. I haven't made it in there.
It won't to be easy. Anytime
you want to come back, you let me know.
I'll think about it.
- I told you to forget it.
- You'll be back.
Yeah, right.
She can't live without me.
He's totally awesome!
- Who, dear?
- Skip! Mom, you're not listening to me.
Skip's a really nice guy,
and I want him to like me...
so I just want to make sure...
Is there something I shouldn't know
that I should know?
Of course there is.


                                 Page 6/37

You're right. He is cute.
- I was hoping you'd come.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
What about that one?
- He dresses like a dork.
- Yeah, but he's cute!
How can you like a dork?
Don't look now. Guess who?
Hello.
Good-bye.
God, he's such a total pukeoid.
He's just really bitchin'. You'll see.
Why don't you take this out now?
The guests are waiting for some food.
What was that all about?
I'm only her stepmother, and since Jim died,
she's been kind of competitive with me.
Spring-up?
Freak me out, it's him!
- Who?
- The guy with the brown hair.
Hi, Skip.
Don't be so obvious with boys.
- Hi, Skip.
- Hi, Suzi.
I'd like you to meet my mother.
- Hi, Mrs. Brent. Nice to meet you.
- Call me Beth.
It's nice to meet you.
- Skip! Lyle.
- How do you do?
Honey, the phone's ringing.
Come on, Skip. Let's go dance.
- Look at who Tommy's with.
- Who cares?
Come on.
He's totally juvenile, Stacey.
- Hi, Tommy.
- Is it?
- Yes, it is.
- What?
The most beautiful girl in the world.
- What's the matter with you, dude?


                                 Page 7/37

- I think I'm falling in love.
Come on. What about Julie?
That's a real tragedy. Dumped.
Jilted. Right in the toilet. My heart's broken.
I'm sure you got to be drunk.
That's what I've always enjoyed about you.
You're perceptive.
You know how to read a guy.
- I need help.
- Yeah?
I was wondering
if you'd step into my office?
God!
- No.
- Don't worry about it.
Oh, Jesus.
Wait, I got a great idea.
Let's do it.
Okay, smart guy. We're here. Now what?
Mingle. Blend in.
Right.
- Can I pick 'em, or what? Check it out.
- Why don't you lower it?
You don't need to raise up a flag or nothing.
Just looking for action.
Let's check out the eats.
What've we got going here, a bait shop?
It's sushi, don't you know? This is tuna.
This is flying fish eggs,
and that's sea urchin.
This is pistachio paste, isn't it?
Come on, Fred, dig in.
I think I'll just get something to drink.
Wait.
This is not right.
- How can this not be right?
- 'Cause what about Julie?
That's over.
She tossed me out.
Don't penalize me for what she did.
I'm the one that got hurt. I am.
- I've always thought about you.
- You have?
I thought about you all day.


                                 Page 8/37

- You want to dance?
- In another life.
I didn't either. I was just taking a poll.
Fred, I didn't know you were this good.
- At least I'm trying.
- What is this, points for effort?
I told you this place
was going to be a waste.
This place sucks.
- Well, well.
- What?
- Hot. Very hot.
- Where? Which one?
They're staring right at us.
Gross! Let's move.
Wait, let's see what happens.
I'm sure! Tell me all about it.
I'm going to talk to Ralphie.
- Bad luck, Fred. Yours is leaving.
- What do you mean, mine's leaving?
- She winked at you, didn't she?
- She did?
Yeah, don't let her get away.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Having a good time?
I'm trying.
That's good.
- What are you doing here?
- It's a party.
I know it's a party, but who invited you?
You mean you have to be invited?
That explains it.
- What?
- Why everyone is dressed so weird.
If I'd been invited,
I'd have known this was a costume party.
Right.
- I saw you once before, you know.
- Where?
At the beach.
That was you?
Do you think a girl should pet
on the first date?


                                 Page 9/37

Who are you, Bozo the Clown?
What's your sign?
Is this gonna mean we're going together?
What?
Is this gonna mean we're going together?
No.
What?
I think it means
you're a pretty lousy friend...
messing around with your friend's boyfriend
while he's in a bad way.
But I'll tell you what.
- What?
- I won't tell anybody if you don't.
Get out...
- I never said that.
- Did you?
- That wasn't you. I'm sorry.
- You know, football.
- I'm not playing this year.
- That was Rick.
Who's Rick?
How you doing, Tommy?
- Is she good?
- Oh, man.
She's a four-star lay, good buddy.
How's your mother?
She's dead.
...and the wind blows it up.
No, I want...
Why don't you get out of here?
You make me get out of here.
Crazy is the word-
Get up!
- You have nothing, faggot!
- Tommy! Stop it!
- Fuck you!
- Get the hell out of here!
- I don't want to hurt you guys.
- You get out-
Fuck you!
Jerk!
Kiss my ass!
You're good, man.


                                 Page 10/37

What were you doing in there,
kissing girls goodnight?
- Listen-
- Don't!
- I won't.
- Good.
That chick, Julie, she's truly dazzling.
Yep.
But she's not one of ours.
Hey, what the hell?
Dickhead, what are you trying to do,
get us killed?
What the hell's the matter with you?
Shit, this is my mother's car.
Who the fuck was that guy?
And I was doing all right with that chick.
Who the fuck does he think he is?
Maybe he was her boyfriend.
Nobody is going to tell me
who I can score with!
I want this chick, she wants me,
so fuck it. We're going back.
My mom will shit
if she knows you're driving this car.
I really don't give a shit
what your mother thinks.
It's bad enough you got to be here.
Be far worse if I got the same treatment.
Wait a second. What are we doing here?
I don't have a death wish.
- They're cute, aren't they?
- Yeah, so swell.
- What if somebody comes?
- Don't worry about it.
Somebody could come.
I told you.
Hurry up in there!
- They can wait.
- Come on, man, I gotta go.
- Take a hike.
- Doug.
- Come here.
- No!
Okay. Lose out.


                                 Page 11/37

- I'm sure.
- Come on, hurry up.
I'm hurrying. Meet me later?
Will you?
- Creep.
- Thanks a lot, man.
- I can't believe he did it.
- I can.
I can't. But guess who's looking at you?
So I said, ""Oh, my God,
I just can't touch that thing. ""
Oh, God, it looked so...
So what? Tell me.
Awesome.
It's like shaking hands with your best friend.
Only, like, real fast.
Come on, let's go.
How many is it we've had?
- You getting high?
- Golly! Where did you get that?
- I'm making some lines here for you.
- Oh, wow!
How is it? Okay?
Hey, you're gonna lose your nose. Look out.
- Don't be afraid.
- What are you doing here?
Do you have a death wish or something?
- That's what Fred said.
- Fred said?
Never mind.
You live around here?
This is very strange.
- What are you doing back here?
- I forgot my comb.
Really, now?
To tell you the truth,
I thought that maybe you and I could...
We could what?
We could get out of here.
I don't think you'd be any more welcome
down there, right now.
Let's leave the party.
- I'm so sure.
- Cool.


                                 Page 12/37

I'll meet you out front.
Wait a minute. Where are we gonna go?
I don't care.
- What are we gonna do?
- Anything.
- Okay, but I have to bring my best friend.
- That's fine.
I'll be waiting for you.
God, I don't want to go! I told you.
- It's going to be fun.
- It is not going to be fun.
They're not even here.
Let's go back.
- I know they're around here.
- Where?
- Right there.
- Hey, come here.
Oh, no. Not those guys.
They're hoods. Juvenile delinquents.
- No.
- You've lost your mind.
- No.
- Look at them.
The rating scale is okay.
- Do this for me.
- I am freaking out!
- No.
- Come on.
Hi. I'm Fred. I like tacos and '71 cabernet,
and my favorite color is magenta.
- I'm Julie, and this is Stacey.
- Charmed, I'm sure.
I'm simply going to freak out and die!
- Would you get in the car?
- God!
I will pay whatever it takes to make sure
nobody breathes a word of this.
I'll be totally bummed out...
if anyone on Earth, outside this car,
finds out about this.
God, where is your sense of adventure?
Will you shut up?
I personally guarantee you,
you will have the time of your life tonight.


                                 Page 13/37

- You'll see things you've only read about.
- I'm sure.
I'm freezing.
- Please put the top up?
- Hope you don't mind if I change-
- This is the last time I take you anywhere.
- I'm sure.
- I like this song.
- Oh, God, I hate this song.
I hate this music.
Look!
No way, Bob!
Sweet cheeks and velvet thighs.
Hey, Harvey!
- I thought you were getting the mohawk!
- Nah, I wussed out.
I like this song.
Hey, Rico! What? You didn't! No way, man.
You didn't do that. I'll talk to you later.
Rad! What's doing?
- Check out the cool wheels on that.
- Shit.
- Sid Vicious lives.
- I'm not getting out of this car.
All right. But when they attack the car,
save the radio.
Hey, baby, why don't you get rid of the bum,
and meet me later?
I don't want to go in here.
- What's doing?
- Nothing going.
Hey, Sean, so what's your salami like?
- Is this your hangout?
- This is my home away from home.
- Do you want to sit down?
- Yeah.
You guys want something to drink?
I got some friends I want to see. Let's go.
I don't even wanna know
what's on this seat.
- Where do you live?
- Hollywood. I go to Hollywood High.
Me, too.
Oh, my God. Don't you have a straw?


                                 Page 14/37

Totally out of touch with civilization.
This is what we call living on the edge.
You don't have places like this
in the Valley, do you?
- No, we're just not into...
- Slumming it.
So what do you do over there that's hot?
We go to normal parties,
we go to normal places.
Buy nice, new clothes.
That's no different from what we do.
It's the way we do things
that makes the difference.
I guess so.
You know, these guys
all look sick, or something.
- You'd all look healthier with a tan.
- You won't catch anything here.
This is the real world.
It's not fresh and clean,
like a television show.
I always thought
the Valley was real enough for me.
Do you think they could
crank this noise up louder?
Noise?
This music's got emotion, power.
That techno-rock
you guys listen to is gutless.
I'm sure.
Fred, that's my leg!
You guys think
you're so different, don't you?
- We are. We're ourselves.
- And we're not?
You're like her
and all the rest of her friends.
You're all fucking programmed.
- So what does it take to be so free?
- That's a good question.
So when can I see you again?
- Thank you.
- Really, Randy...
why don't you wait until


                                 Page 15/37

the end of the evening to say these things?
It's the way I feel. It's what I want.
All right, we're going to play a song.
It's called A Million Miles AwaY.
I'm here with you now.
I know.
It's like I can't explain it, you know?
It's like my brains won't stop going.
You know?
Yeah?
It's like I feel connected to you somehow.
It's like I'm...
It's like we're linked, or something.
I'm starting to sound like my parents.
Steve, honey, come on. Stop worrying.
She's going to be all right.
Remember our night in the cemetery?
God! You are so weird. Go away.
My little pickle.
My darling.
- This is so embarrassing.
- I think you're cute.
God!
Look, I just hope I can see you again.
Why not? I thought you liked me.
For sure.
Well?
My friends will freak, you know?
None of us have had a dude
outside of school.
Fuck 'em. Be the first one on your block.
Do you always have to talk like that?
- My darling.
- You're so weird.
I want to see you tomorrow.
You can't. I have to work,
if you can believe that.
It's so uncool.
Where do you work?
In my parents' store.
- What kind of a store?
- It's a store, you know?
I know, a store. What do you sell?
Health foods.


                                 Page 16/37

That's cool.
It's not. It's so uncool.
Why couldn't they own
a Pizza Hut, or something?
God!
- I have to go home now.
- You don't.
Come on!
- My parents must be up, I'm sure.
- Are you going to get into trouble?
They're pretty cool.
But I've never done this before.
I better go.
I want to see you tomorrow.
- Julie, is that you?
- Yeah, Mom, it's me. Sorry.
We have been worried sick about you.
Where have you been,
that you'd have to stay out all night?
- I don't think I want to hear this.
- We have no secrets in this family.
We know you're at an age now
where boys are more important...
and nature plays its little part
in the scheme of life.
- What am I talking about? I'm sure-
- God! Get serious.
I was out all night, but I didn't-
- You don't have to... Cool it.
- Julie, listen.
What your father is trying to say, dear,
is whatever you do is all right with us...
as long as it doesn't hurt you,
or anyone else.
- Right.
- Wait, Mom, I just-
You see, we just want you
to be careful and responsible.
Your mother and I worry about you, honey.
It's not fair, with all the creepy-crawlers
out there, and everything.
- I'm just going to bed now.
- Wait a minute.
We were young once.


                                 Page 17/37

Your mother still is. We understand.
- This isn't the Age of Aquarius.
- I would that it were.
Why don't you just punish me
like Stacey's parents do?
Bad karma, dear.
- Guess what?
- What?
Skip asked for my phone number.
God, I hope he calls.
- Fasten your seat belt.
- God, I hate these things.
They totally ruin the crease in my pants.
Make sure you're in park, then turn the key.
Where did you guys disappear to
the other night?
Let Julie concentrate.
Let Julie drive.
You don't want to be part of the pavement.
I have the right to know. It was my party.
Suzi, I mean, I didn't feel good.
I almost barfed from all that sushi,
you know?
And Julie took me home.
Cut the chatter, girls.
I want you to know you're my best friends.
- Eyes forward, Julie.
- Tell us quick, who is he?
- He was at the party.
- Eyes forward, mouth shut.
- Who is it? Brad was there the whole night-
- Who is it, Julie?
- Randy.
- Who's Randy?
- He's the most awesome dude ever.
- Where was I when he was around?
Where were you?
- You don't mean that guy-
- Cut the conversation, girls.
He's that guy from Hollywood.
He came back for Stacey and me...
and took us back over the hill.
We had a super time.
I mean, your party was super and all.


                                 Page 18/37

Man, he's just like trippin'- dicular,
you know?
- Wasn't he, Stacey?
- You die, Richman.
Straighten out!
You can't go through there. Stop!
You'll be in big trouble if this gets around.
What if Tommy finds out?
- So what?
- You've got a reputation to protect.
Don't we all?
Fail.
Dump the Sohio at 34 and one eighth.
Sure. Did you net in the cocoa futures?
- Today would be great.
- Delivery.
Hold on.
Come on in. The gate's open.
I'll get right back to you.
Hi, Mrs. Brent.
- Skip. From the party.
- I know.
Skip. From the party.
Don't stand there holding those.
Put them down.
Put them down there.
- You had a good time, I hope?
- Ma'am?
- You enjoyed yourself at the party?
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm a little bit disappointed in you.
- Ma'am?
- We talked quite a bit at the party...
and I watched you...
I believe in being direct. How about you?
Just tell me exactly what you're thinking.
Say, ""Beth, I... ""
Okay.
It's no accident
that I'm the one delivering the groceries.
That's a start.
I guess so.
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Sure.


                                 Page 19/37

I mean, no.
I've still got a few more deliveries to make.
I've really got to get back to work.
That was quick.
I've got a little tip for you, Skip.
You got to be kidding.
Plastics.
The time to do something
is when the time is right.
What time is it?
Actually, it's almost time
for Suzi to get home.
- I guess I see what you mean.
- Good.
If nothing else, we've learned that.
Don't be a stranger.
'Bye.
- 'Bye.
- See ya.
See ya.
A Red Zinger tea.
A Bombay Avocado Delight.
And a cup of wheatgrass juice.
Okay. Would you like some bean sprouts?
Steve, we're out of the A, the B-12,
and the D, and the C.
- I think there's some B-12 in the back.
- Okay.
- What?
- There go the water buffaloes.
They are kind of old, dear.
Beg your pardon.
I got these for Woodstock, remember?
Or was it the march on Washington?
That was almost 14 years ago,
and you were right the first time.
- You got the Earth shoes for Washington.
- Right, the Earth shoes.
- Are you sure?
- Positive, dear.
Remember? You were going to do
a lot of walking?
You're right.
I think I'll go get the B-12.


                                 Page 20/37

God, this stuff is so gross.
How could people eat that?
Because it isn't greasy,
doesn't mean it's bad for you, dodo.
It's yuck.
You're a yuck.
Oh, my God, I'm going to die!
- What are you doing? Are you all right?
- I'm humiliated to the max.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Randy, this is my dad.
- Steve Richman.
- What's happening? How's it going?
- Fine. How are you doing?
Great.
- That's great.
- He wants a sandwich.
Right, okay.
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.
- But why here?
- What's wrong with this place?
This place is gross.
All this stuff that tastes like nothing,
but is so good for you.
What about the sprouts?
Did you get in trouble the other night?
- For what?
- Coming home so late.
- No.
- Didn't your parents find out?
Yeah, they were waiting up.
- Don't they care?
- Sure they care...
but I'm supposed to develop
into my own person, you know?
That sounds good.
How about a Coke?
Sorry, my dad said
they supported the war effort...
and it rots the enzymes in your stomach.
- That sounds good to me.
- Right.


                                 Page 21/37

- Let's get out of here.
- Don't you have to work?
I've got flexible hours.
See you, Dad.
Bye-bye, sweetie.
Come up with any new gizmos?
We got some new stuff.
You can take a look at it.
Honey, where's Julie?
- She left with Randy.
- Who's Randy?
I think he's that dude
she was out with the other night.
Do you think
we should talk to her about this?
- I don't know.
- Maybe I should talk to her.
So, where's Julie?
We haven't seen much of her
in the last week.
She doesn't have time
for her friends anymore.
I can't believe that.
You guys were such good friends.
- What's with her?
- It's more like who's with her.
I mean, this guy, Randy,
is filling her head with air.
I nominated her for class rep,
and she wasn't even there.
If she'd listen to me, I'd set her straight.
You girls are her friends, you should try.
She dumped me.
Far be it for me to interfere with her life.
You're right, Tommy.
She did dump you and your advice, buddy.
Go on and laugh. I still love that girl.
I know how to make her happy...
This geek that she's with
could scar her for life.
God. For life?
No. Come on, Suzi.
What is it with Loryn?
What's going on? Way to go, spaz!


                                 Page 22/37

- I didn't mean to do it, spaz.
- Get lost.
She's always into everything, you know?
Suzi, it's a total bummer
when you're young...
and you don't even know why you're here.
Yeah, I mean...
Okay, this one is so tubular.
Suzi, pass the chips, will you?
Can you, like, grow some more zits?
No, but I thought
maybe I could borrow some of yours, okay?
My thighs just grow, looking at that stuff.
- What can you do?
- You chew them up and spit them out.
How gross!
People do that to stay skinny.
It's very serious.
Cindy Boo lost 90 pounds,
and even, like, scarfed on ice cream.
- Are you serious? No way.
- Yeah, you know, like, splurge and purge?
Or, like, scarf and barf.
- Very immature.
- I'll start my diet tomorrow.
You better watch out.
Randy might like the Hollywood lean look.
Yeah, but blimps don't get to go
with Tommy.
Who?
- Tommy.
- Who?
Fuck him.
Girls, we must fuck him.
What is that little brat doing?
- Give me the chips.
- Sorry.
- Not too cool, all right, Peggy?
- I am, too, cool.
Your mom is so bitchin', Suzi.
Put that back, Loryn.
You're too small for that.
I am not too small. I look totally hot in this.
No man could resist my...


                                 Page 23/37

- What do you call it?
- Your tits.
Put that stuff back.
- Do you think Randy will like me in this?
- Yeah, if it was made out of black leather.
Tommy's going to look real good
after six grody bus rides into Hollywood.
Like, all those sweaty bods. Barf me out.
You'll really get off
hearing about all the parties.
What do you mean?
Because you'll never be able to go to any,
as long as you got Randy.
Don't you think they have parties
over there?
Where, at the zoo?
You can just kiss class rep good-bye.
Big deal, okay?
Hello?
Who is this? Hi, Skip.
I was hoping you'd call.
My mom said she saw you the other day.
- She did?
- Yeah. She thinks you're all right.
She does?
- Tell him to come over.
- Go for it!
Why don't you come over?
My mom is gone.
Oh, yeah? For how long?
For most of the night.
Maybe all night. She's out on a date.
What do you say?
I can't.
My mom's got a lot of stuff
for me to do around here.
I was just calling to say hi and all.
You know, see what you're up to.
- I'll talk to you later, okay?
- When?
Jeez, I don't know. Later, I guess.
Okay.
Okay. Good-bye.
A date.


                                 Page 24/37

- Do you think he likes me?
- He called you, didn't he?
You know the type. He's shy.
I could die. He's so buff.
- I know he likes you.
- Like the way Randy likes you?
For sure, Stacey.
You know, Julie, you can
kiss all the bitchin' Val dudes good-bye.
Like I really care.
I hear there's something really grody
about the air in Hollywood.
And the guys, they only get to be that big.
- Is that true?
- Yeah.
- What's the biggest one you've ever seen?
- Like in the National Geographic, or what?
No, in your hand.
Damn it. God!
Hello?
It's me, Skip.
I'm just returning one of Suzi's books.
Jesus Christ.
What do you think?
Everybody thinks
Tommy is so tubular and all, you know?
So you think I should pick Tommy.
What I mean is, if you were
to get back together with Tommy...
do you think things would be better?
You mean I should pick Randy?
I don't know about that.
What I'm trying to say...
It's really hard for me to say
what I'm trying to say.
Loryn, this isn't helping me.
I don't know what to do about this.
Me, either.
- Oh, shit.
- Mom.
What's up?
I got this problem,
and I don't know what to do about it.
Yeah? That's easy.


                                 Page 25/37

Take it back and get a more expensive one.
The expensive ones always fit better, honey.
Dad.
That's not it? All right, what is it?
You know, this is really hard.
All right.
Shoot.
I like Randy a lot, you know?
He's different.
What, he was in an accident?
Things don't work the way they should?
- No!
- I saw a movie like that, once.
Did you?
- All right. How is he different?
- I don't know.
He doesn't dress like my friends,
or even talk like them.
I see.
Is that wrong?
My friends think so.
That's important?
Sure, I guess.
- I don't want to lose them.
- Of course not.
And they all want me to be with Tommy.
- What do you want?
- I want to be with Randy.
It's getting hard. I don't want any problems.
There's the rub, you see? Nothing's easy.
I want to show you something.
You see, honey,
sometimes the way things look...
aren't the way they really are...
or the way they're going to turn out.
Here.
I don't think you ever saw these.
- Are these you?
- Yep, that's me.
- Who's this?
- She's a friend of mine.
Before I met your mother.
Not everyone looked or dressed like that
back then.


                                 Page 26/37

In fact, lots of people didn't look like that.
I can believe that.
I don't think Randy's ever looked this bad.
The point is,
what difference does it all make?
The way you look, the kinds of clothes
you wear on your body...
It's what you are that counts,
what's inside you, what you stand for...
not what other people want to make you.
Honey, there are lots of people out there...
who ain't happy unless you live and think
the same way they do.
And if you don't...
- You dig what I'm saying?
- I know all about that stuff.
But which one do I pick?
Randy or Tommy.
Beats me, love,
but let me know when you decide.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- Hi, Julie.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
This has been too tough, you know?
It's not really fair.
It's either Randy, or you guys.
Life's not fair.
Randy is totally special to me, Stacey...
and I don't understand why.
I mean, he doesn't do
the things we like to do...
- but-
- Julie, you left out one possibility:
totally gnarly sex.
It hasn't gotten that far.
I know everyone is counting on me
to do the right things.
So did you?
I don't know.
But it was fun while it lasted.
So you've done the right thing.


                                 Page 27/37

I don't know, you guys,
being popular can be so lonely.
It doesn't have to be, Stacey.
What am I going to do?
I kissed Tommy off in a major way.
Forget that. I mean, Tommy is such a hunk.
He told us he still loves you a bunch.
He did? When?
He just said it one day, you know?
Just make up with him. He'll take you back.
- He's got to be bummed to the max with me.
- He'll get over it.
Hey, you know, why break up
the most bitchin' couple at school?
I mean, Tommy can't be king of the prom
going stag.
He's got his position to worry about.
Okay, I'll talk to him.
Are you sure he wants me back, though?
Of course. I just told you so.
Hey, Julie, I asked Arthur to the prom.
What'd he say?
He goes, ""Okay. ""
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.
I gotta go.
I've got all this homework
I forgot about. Come on, Loryn.
- See you, Julie.
- Bye-bye.
- 'Bye, Julie.
- See ya.
- How you been?
- I've been getting by, I guess.
You?
All right.
How's your new boyfriend?
What's-his-name?
It's over.
He wasn't mean to you, was he?
If he was, I'll go kick his ass sideways.
I did it once, I'll do it again.
It wasn't that.
It was just that he was different, that's all.


                                 Page 28/37

Is this what you want?
Listen, Doug's got his dad's Mercedes.
We're gonna cruise Van Nuys.
You wanna go?
- Sure, I guess.
- All right.
Can I have some of your hamburger?
You can.
- Hey, babe.
- Randy.
- What's the matter with you?
- Why didn't you call me first?
It slipped my mind.
I didn't think it was that important.
But I will tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna reach in my pocket, get a dime...
go down to the phone booth, make a call,
come right back up, and talk to you.
Why do you always barge in like that?
- You shouldn't talk like that.
- Don't tell me what to do.
You have no control over my life.
I can see anybody I want to, okay?
I'm sorry.
I didn't think it was that big a deal.
Look, I have to go to bed now.
Hey, come over here.
I love you.
That's all I wanted to say.
I love you.
So, when can I see you... Hey.
When can I see you again?
- You can't.
- What?
Don't do that to me!
You can't see me anymore.
Is it your father or mother?
Let me talk to them. I can fix things.
There's nothing to fix. It's not them.
It's not them at all. It's me, okay?
I can't see you anymore, okay?
Okay.
I know what it is.
I know what this is.


                                 Page 29/37

It's your fucking friends, right?
Shit, Julie, what is this?
It's between you and me...
not between the rest of the fucking world.
So fuck off!
It's your friends.
Fuck you!
Fuck off, for sure! Like, totally!
I don't fucking care. I don't give a fuck.
I don't fucking care, man.
- Randy? You look like shit.
- Hey, how you doing?
- I shouldn't let you in here.
- You been doing good?
- Come on.
- All right. That's what I want.
You feel so good.
Hello, Samantha.
I've been looking for you tonight.
Liar. You haven't been looking for me...
and I haven't been looking for you
in two months now.
You're right. But here we are.
Did I ever tell you how good you feel?
You did tell me that.
Let's make up.
You want to make up some more?
Your place or mine?
How about a cigarette?
How about a sip?
What's he getting?
- Who's that?
- Don't know.
Go home, Randy.
Hey, puto, want a light?
Fuck you, scum! Get out of the car.
- Are you bad at me?
- Yeah, I'm bad.
- Get out of the fucking car, shit.
- Are you bad, man?
- Get out of the car.
- I'll show you bad.
Come on, keep going!
- Hey, man.


                                 Page 30/37

- What are you doing?
You're a dumb son of a bitch, man.
Guys like that'll kill you.
I don't give... Fuck 'em.
Just leave me alone.
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- Fuck you, too.
Hey, man, who're you talking to?
It's me, Bailey.
You're shitfaced.
I don't feel so good.
I'm going to be sick.
Go on. Leave me alone!
Go on, now, leave me alone.
Leave you alone? Why?
So you can feel sorry for yourself...
because some little Valley chick
wanted somebody else, is that it?
Hit me with that brick. I'm dying.
- Just put me out of my misery.
- Come on, man.
Man, you smell fucking awful.
Screw it, man.
- You gonna make me feel great?
- Come off that, man.
Look, if you want this girl so bad...
why don't you do something about it?
I mean...
go for the wild, crazy stuff.
- Wild and crazy.
- Yeah.
Don't tell me that.
Come on, man. It's romantic shit.
Girls love that stuff, you know?
Trust me. It never fails.
I know.
We have to talk.
I told you we can't.
- Young man...
- What?
Are you being held prisoner, or what?
- Give me a signal.
- Get out of the car.
- But I love you.


                                 Page 31/37

- Get out of the car!
Let's go.
You've just heard Men at Work.
We have more dedications tonight...
to Billy from Dina. She says, ""You're a fox. ""
Andrea to Doug, she'll do
""anything to get you back. ""
To Julie, his favorite Valley girl,
Randy sends his undying love, and says;
""Like, come back soon, you know. ""
- I've got to get to Algebra. I'll see you later.
- Okay. See you.
Enjoy your ride.
- Oh, bitchin'. Is this in 3-D?
- No, but your face is.
Like, I hate 3-D. It gives me a headache.
It's not in 3-D.
Have a nice flight.
Good. Check this geek out.
Who is this guy?
I guess these go
right back down there now, don't they?
How you doing down there?
It appears you forgot
our French fries and Coke, fishhead.
Peter Piper picked a pepper,
I guess I did. I'm sorry.
- That guy's nuts.
- What a geek!
Oh, my God!
Don't do that. Come on, Julie!
Don't do this.
- She's out there somewhere.
- Yep.
What you're doing ain't working.
You need a good plan.
I didn't know that.
Listen, if you're going to have
that kind of attitude, I won't even tell you.
Just forget I ever tried to save you
from your miserable existence.
Okay, I'll tell you. Twist my arm.
Listen, I got a plan...
that's going to get you in solid with the


                                 Page 32/37

love of your life, and at the same time...
achieve the grandest form of retribution
against the guy who kicked your ass.
So he had a little help.
Oh, man.
Where are you and Arthur going?
We're going straight to the hot-tub club.
Listen. We were on the waiting list,
and we got in.
- Oh, my God.
- Where's Julie going with Tommy?
I heard...
Tommy made reservations
at the Valley Sheraton!
Does she know?
- No.
- No way!
Far out. This kid doesn't miss a trick.
Sarah, you got to see this.
Sarah! Lancelot's here!
Not so loud, dear.
Look at me. I'm probably more nervous
than the kids are. Look at these hands.
I don't understand
what you're so nervous about.
You act like it's your prom.
I don't know. Feel these hands. They're wet.
- Wow.
- Look at her.
Look at you, honey.
You look lovely, darling.
Beautiful!
That's Tommy. Quick, get the camera.
We can't miss a moment of this. Hurry.
What's the deal with him?
I think your father
has just faced his mortality.
You're both in pink, you just look beautiful.
Steve! Hurry up, dear! Tommy's here.
Are you all right, honey?
I'm coming. I'm looking for the camera.
Just wait two more minutes. Steve will be
here in just one minute with the camera.
We have to get a picture of this.


                                 Page 33/37

We really do.
Hurry up, dear!
- Here he is.
- Hi, Tommy. How you doing, man?
Mighty spiffy.
Look at them. Are they a picture?
We got to get a picture of this.
I still got film in here from the wedding.
- What wedding?
- They were married last September.
- Newlyweds.
- Can't be too careful.
Okay, let's get some snapperoos here.
Dad. Earth to Dad.
Imagine that. The old lens cap.
- Okay, here we go.
- Closer.
No stopping us now. Get closer together.
Give us a big smile, Tommy.
- Smile, come on. Closer.
- That's it. Not too much.
- A little goes a long way with some people.
- I got to go.
You look beautiful. Have a wonderful time.
- Trust me.
- Me, too.
'Bye!
Come on. Let's go see 'em.
Her first prom.
Far out.
Feeling better, dear?
Yeah!
You know...
maybe we should have gone.
I mean, how bad could it have been?
What?
Your prom.
What is this, Bangkok?
I don't need a massage.
Do you have any of that stuff for me?
Sure. Come on. We'll light it up.
- Are you ready to party?
- Yeah!
Let's hear it.


                                 Page 34/37

Here's Josie Cotton and the Party Crashers!
- You think this is something, wait till later.
- What do you mean?
- I can't believe this.
- Shit.
We should've shined up the wagon,
or cleaned out the back seat.
- I'm doing the best I can.
- What is this?
Did you clip butterflies' wings
as a kid? Maybe you still do.
Listen, I told you, I've got a plan.
Enough said?
This is it, Fred.
I'm rushing that birthday cake.
Cool everything and listen.
This is all going like clockwork.
I'm getting very excited about this.
So just hang on.
This will be a night we'll never forget.
- Come on, what is it?
- You'll see.
- They really are rather dissolute.
- Where are the cups?
Miss Liebman, do you know
where the cups are?
- I don't know where the cups are.
- Looking for the cups?
- Mr. Brooks, do you know-
- I haven't seen cups all evening.
Suzi was supposed to bring them,
but she never even showed up.
Thank goodness.
I think we should get out of here.
Arthur, let's wait until after they announce
the king and queen at least, okay?
Okay.
Boys, how we doing?
- Mr. Brooks.
- Hi, Mr. Brooks.
- How's that punch?
- It's Bosco.
I'd like to try some. Where are the cups?
Wow, there's no cups.


                                 Page 35/37

A little flat.
She's there.
Suzi, where have you been?
Everybody's been waiting for the cups.
Where have you been?
What have you been doing?
- Have you been getting laid, Suzi?
- Loryn, just...
Where's Ralphie?
Indian wrestling with the boys,
or something totally grody like that.
Wow. Sorry.
It's cool. I'm not going to eat
anything now...
so when we go to La Serre,
I can scarf up half the menu.
- All right.
- Okay, 'bye.
- Stacey. Check out this, dude.
- I don't want to see Stacey.
That's it, Bailey. I've had it with you.
- I didn't think her haircut was so bad.
- What do you mean, her haircut?
I just want to know
the rest of this big plan of yours.
What do you mean, ""the rest""?
This is it. Simplicity at its finest.
Simplicity at its finest?
At least you got me here.
So let's...
crush that fly.
Is this on?
And now, students...
the moment
that you've all been waiting for...
the announcement of
the king and the queen of Valley High.
What is being king and queen all about?
Is it about who wears the nicest clothes?
I think not.
Is it about who's dating
the captain of the football team?
Or who's seeing the head cheerleader?
I don't think so.


                                 Page 36/37

Is it a popularity contest?
I doubt it.
I'm going to give you the chance
you never gave me.
...when one is honorable,
when one is disciplined...
when one has school spirit.
Yes...
kings and queens...
they don't grow on trees.
Hold this.
Everyone can't be a king and a queen.
Let's go, boy. Get up.
I remember my prom.
I wanted to be the queen.
I wasn't.
Stop it!
Watch this.
...who have set an example
for our whole school with their behavior.
They need no introduction...
because they are not just
the king and queen of Valley High...
they are Valley High.
Your king. Your queen.
Get your hands off me, you fucking dick.
Julie, what's going on here?
That must be some party
you got going there.
Yeah.
Valley Sheraton?
Sir?
Yeah.

What If

    Page 1/69

I'm not saying
that it's a good explanation,
it's obviously a bad explanation,
but we can't just
leave things like this.
You have to call me back, okay?
Wallace, whatever happened,
I still love you.

[CHATTERING]
Yeah, that was supposed to be
an anonymous fridge magnet poem.
And here I am quietly judging you.
Oh, I can handle it.
I've humiliated myself
much more thoroughly
in front of people I actually know.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
[NEEDLE SCRATCHES]
[POP MUSIC
PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
I'm sorry, I moved your poem.
I find this, like, weirdly addictive.

WALLACE:

CHANTRY:

ALLAN:

CHANTRY:
- Here it is. Here it is.
- Hi.
- Oh, did you guys meet?
- Uh, kind of, yeah.




                                    Page 2/69

ALLAN:
Chantry. She's an animator.
- Chantry, this is Wallace.
- You're Wallace?
This is the first time
he's been outside in, like, a year.
- Wow.

WALLACE:
Yeah, you do look pale.
I just assumed you were,
like, anemic or partially albino.
- It's both, actually.

ALLAN:
- like bear because of his broken heart.

CHANTRY:
Stop telling people
and stroking my face.
[ALLAN CHUCKLES]

CHANTRY:

NICOLE:
Uh, she's small, has brown hair, always
bragging about her eating disorder.
I'm Becky.
- It's been a while.

WOMAN:
It's so good to see you again.
That's just what she sounds like!
Can I give you a tour of the house?
[ALLAN SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
Come.
[BOTH SPEAK IN SPANISH]

CHANTRY:
To be fair, um,
I don't always like parties, either.
Awkward small talk is not my forte.
It's ""fort,"" actually.
""Forte"" is Italian, it means ""forcefully.""


                                    Page 3/69

And ""fort"" is French for ""strength.""
But I still say ""forte"" too.
If you say ""fort,""
everyone thinks you're getting it wrong,
even though it is correct.
So is that, like, your thing?
Correcting people's pronunciation?
- Yeah, that's my thing.
- How's that going for you?
I have a dead-end job,
live in my sister's attic,
and I never go out.
Uh, correcting pronunciation
is my old thing.
Actually, my new thing
is over-sharing.
- Heh.
- Here, try some of Allan's beer.
Thank you.
You actually knocked yourself out?
- I think so.
- Wow.
And I'll tell you
something really weird.
My face is, like,
permanently damaged.
Like, if you look up here,
you can see there's, like...
- I think there's, like, a dent.
- Sort of like, uh, Quasimodo.
Yeah.
So, um, I've got to go
to the bathroom.
Do you need anything,
like some dental floss,
or, you know, um, expired aspirin?
No, but I've left
a matchbox in there,
and I was hoping women
could leave pubic hair...
[LAUGHS]
Uh, I'll just go around with,
like, a party tray.
No, they'll be in there.


                                 Page 4/69

It'll be fine.
- I'm stuffing a pillow.
- Okay.
[MOANING]

WALLACE:
- Oh. Hi.
I was just, um, leaving
without saying goodbye, like a dick.
Yeah. Yeah, that's totally
what I am doing as well.
- Heh.
- Oh.
- Where are you...?
- Oh, um,
I'm just, like,
a couple blocks west.
- Me too.
- Oh.
- Uh, would you like to walk together?
- Um, yeah. Sure.
Cool.
I read in the tabloids
that she's a cannibal
- and he faked Parkinson's for attention.
- I read that too. Crazy.
Awful people. Really.
Um, this is actually me here.
Oh. Right. Um, well, hey,
I had a really good time talking to you.
Yeah. Me too.
Which is rare, actually.
I'm usually not that social, so...
Well, um,
maybe you'd like
to talk again sometime.
Yeah, definitely.
We should hang out.
Yeah. It'd be lovely.
Okay, so, I'm gonna
give you my number.
- Okay. I will...
- Top secret.
Good.


                                 Page 5/69

I did not mean to stay out so late.
No, me neither.
My boyfriend will be worried about,
um, what happened to me,
so, you know, call me.
Yes. Thank you very much. Um...
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.
- Cool.
- Good night.
Good night.
[SIGHS]
[SIGHS]

WALLACE:
I had a good time talking to you.

CHANTRY:
Yeah. Me too.
My boyfriend will be wondering
what happened to me.
[CHIRPING]
Hey, what's up, Felix?
[THUD THEN ELLIE GRUNTS]
- You all right?
- Just dropped an earring.
Your dinner's in the oven.
- Good night.
- What time will you be home?
If the date is good, midnight.
If the date is bad, 8.
Uh, no treats, okay?
And no horror movies.
And don't let him go up on the roof.
And don't sell his organs
on the black market.
Okay. I'm off.

WALLACE:
Take care. Have fun. Good luck.

as much pleasure

I want to see my face

CHANTRY:
Hey. Um, no, I think we're okay.
Thanks. Yeah.
Sorry, I didn't see you there.
No, I also didn't see you


                                    Page 7/69

standing right next to me.
Hi, Wallace.
- Chantry.
- Yes.
- I'm here alone.
- Me too.
My boyfriend was supposed to come,
but he had to work late, so...
I like seeing movies by myself, though.
I think it's, um,
really cool you're here alone.
Oh, yeah. Super cool.
Yeah.

CHANTRY:

WALLACE:
I don't think you can have Princess
Bride as one of your favorite movies
if you actually think love
makes you a worse person.
Well, no, it's irrelevant.
The Princess Bride
is a fairy tale.
In fairy tales, love inspires you
to be noble and courageous,
but in real life, love is just an
all-purpose excuse for selfish behavior.
You can lie and cheat and hurt people,
and it's all okay because you're in love.
I don't know
if you are actually cynical,
or just a super crazy,
romantic cheese ball.
You go see Princess Bride by yourself,
on a week night, like a total loser.
Yeah, well, your boyfriend ditched you,
and you still came all by yourself,
- so who's the real loser?
- Are you hungry?

CHANTRY:
you ordered fried pickles.
Pickles are disgusting.


                                 Page 8/69

Pickling is like embalming, basically.
Like, a pickle jar
is like a tomb for cucumbers.
I violated a tremendous amount
of corpses in medical school,
so I know that pickling
is not the same as embalming.
- You're a doctor?
- Uh, heh, no.
- Med school dropout.
- All right.
[CRUNCHING]
The whole premise of deep-frying
is it makes everything taste better.
- I don't like deep-fried food.
- French fries?
- Eugh.
- Onion rings?
- Fried chicken?
- Nope.
- Fish and chips?
- Gross.
Funnel cakes? Doughnuts?
Deep-fried banana sandwiches?
No, but Elvis ate those.
And something called Fool's Gold.
- What is that?
- I don't know exactly,
but I read on the Internet
that Elvis died
with 40 pounds of undigested feces
still in his intestine.
Thank you for telling me that
in the middle of dinner.
- You're welcome.
- Next time I take a bite,
- you can say ""diarrhea.""
- Diarrhea.
Is this something
you learn in med school?
Yeah. They go through the...
- All the famous people.
- All the famous people
and how much feces were left in


                                 Page 9/69

them at the time of their death.
- Marie Antoinette?
- Tons.
In fact, they had to guillotine
her intestine as well as her head.
Yeah. They just, like, moved the body
further along through the machine.
Who do you think weighs the feces?
I think, as the king,
it would've been, like,
a job that people fought for.
- Mm-hm.
- ""Well, if I can't dress him,
if I can't make him look pretty for the
casket, can I at least touch his poo?""
- You think he kept a bit?
- I'm sure he did.
In a matchbox or something, yeah.
Like, one of those little vials
you could wear around your neck.
Like, yeah, he had, like,
a little shit locket.
- Heh-heh-heh-heh.
- Yeah, yes.

CHANTRY:
with Ben for five years, and, like,
I get that guys don't want to hang out
with the girl with the boyfriend,
but it just sucks, you know.
It just makes you feel like
the only thing
that's interesting about you
is how you look with your clothes off.
I mean, like, it should be easier
to make friends if you have a boyfriend,
because there's no confusion.
Uh, so is that it?
That's your big pitch
to be my friend?
- Um...
- That was terrible.
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'm just...


                                 Page 10/69

I practiced in the mirror, and...
- Anyway...
- Friends?
- Yeah, why not? Friends.
- All right.
Is this how you make friends?
Like a business deal?
Yeah, actually. It's just my style.
- It's quite unnerving, but it's good.
- Heh-heh.

WALLACE:
What's shaking, hot pants?
You can't write,
What's shaking, hot pants.""
Have you seen anyone wearing
hot pants in the last five years?
That homeless man who shouts
at people near the pool.
[COMPUTER DINGS]

WALLACE:
So I found this website
where they explain what
Fool's Gold is.
- You take
- Heh.
A loaf of Italian white bread,
you coat it in butter
and bake it.
[TIMER DINGS]
Then you hollow out the inside
and coat it
with an entire jar of peanut butter,
and an entire jar of jam.
Then you stuff it
with a pound of crispy bacon.
The website said it serves
eight to ten people, or one Elvis.
You know, a jar of peanut butter
has, like, 6,000 calories in it.
And bacon is not even a food.
Technically, it's just pure fat.

re:
I can't confirm how much feces
were in Elvis's colon when he died,
but I did find out
how he discovered Fool's Gold.""
They get on the jet, private jet,
fly to Denver, get to Denver,
order Fool's Gold sandwiches
to be delivered to the plane,
eat them, fly back to Graceland
without ever getting off the plane.
- Wow.
- And the best part is,
February 1, 1976?
The day my parents got married.
- Oh, no! Wallace!

WALLACE:
[SIGHS]
[MOUSE CLICKS]

ALLAN:
it starts dirty, it ends dirty.
A relationship that starts with a breakup
is doomed to end with a breakup.
- Who said that?
- Me.
You, after Vicky Cardero gave me
a BJ at her boyfriend's keg party
- and I wanted to ask her out.
- I recall you ignored that advice.
- What was the result?
- It ended dirty.
Gonorrhea-and-a-fistfight dirty.
This is not gonorrhea and a fistfight.
I'm not trying to break them up.
I just... I'm happy
just being friends with her.
Is this a good


                                 Page 12/69

housewarming gift for Nicole?
Why are you buying her a gift?
She's moving into your house.
Girls are weird about this sort of stuff,
and I'd rather overcompensate.
How much for the flying moose?
This dinner is a terrible idea.
Normally, I wouldn't care about you
tumbling into some mess with a girl.
I'd even rejoice at the statistically tiny
but mathematical possible chance
of a threesome, but this is my cousin.
I accidentally saw her labia one time,
immediately, explosive diarrhea.
Oh, but you are misreading
this whole situation,
because you can't interact with
a woman without sex screwing it up.
But I can, because I'm a grown-up.
And it's so adorable
that you really believe that.
More importantly,
if this was your bedside lamp,
do you think the warm glow would make
you feel more sexually experimental?
- Absolutely.
- What do you think?
I've got the same one at home.

DALIA:
that's ever happened in all of history.
Was it worse than when that meteor
hit Earth and killed all the dinosaurs?
Yes. My breakup is definitely
worse than a stupid meteor.
I just can't believe
that Rob cheated on you.
- With a grad student!
- No, I know.
Her thesis is probably
on how to be a rat-faced whore.
And I really liked him.
I'm so sorry.
I liked him so much, I don't even want to


                                 Page 13/69

sleep with his friends to get back at him.
I mean, I will,
but I'm not gonna enjoy it.
Do you think there might be, like,
a less skanky option for rebounding?
No. This is something
you have to do.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
- I don't want to wreck your dinner party.
- No, no, it's not a dinner party.
It's just, like, my friend, Wallace.
Stay. This Wallace guy
could be a good rebound for you.
Okay.
Please, go easy on him.
He's delicate.
- Hi!

WALLACE:
- Hey. I brought booze.
- Thank you! That's so nice.

WALLACE:
- You can take your coat off.
I will. Thank you very much.
Well, this place
looks just like I imagined.
- Really?
- Well, I mean,
yeah, I pictured more potpourri
and doilies and stuffed animals
- and things, knowing you, but, yeah...
- I put that away.
I know that it weirds you out.
Ben, Wallace is here.

WALLACE:
- Hey, Wallace. How are you?
Hi.
Oh. Oh. Sorry.
- No worries.

BEN:
- Thanks for coming by.


                                 Page 14/69

- No. Nice to meet you. Thank you.
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey.
Oh, um, Wallace,
this is my sister, Dalia.

WALLACE:
- Nice to meet you.

WALLACE:
- Hi.
[DALIA SNIFFS]
- You smell really good.
- Really?
Yeah. Or maybe
it just smells really bad in here, right?
No, he smells great.
But it is getting kind of oniony in here.
- Can someone open the window?
- Yeah, I'll get it.

CHANTRY:
Right over there.
So, Wallace, I'd like to get
your opinion on something.
- Uh, yeah?
- Europe.
The...? The continent?
- See?

BEN:
- Is it?

CHANTRY:

BEN:
- It is.
He is from that continent,
he should know.
Okay, look at a map,
any map,
Europe's not a separate continent,
it's clearly part of Asia.
Right. But, wait, so if Europe isn't


                                 Page 15/69

a continent, then why is it a continent?
Because Europeans were the ones
who decided what the continents are,
and they didn't want to get lumped in
with all the, you know, Asians.
Ben is trying to change the world
from the inside out.
Okay? Eurasia.
That's what they should call it.
- Europe plus Asia: Eurasia.

WALLACE:
- Who wants more wine?

CHANTRY:
- Um, in my glass.

DALIA:
And so, um, Ben, what is it exactly
that you do at the UN?
I'm part of an international consortium
of lawyers with a UN mandate
- to negotiate copyright standards.

WALLACE:
More importantly, are you trying
to sleep with my girlfriend?

CHANTRY:
and Allan invited me...
Uh, don't worry,
we're just talking ""guy,"" okay?
They think we're talking about
international copyright law.
Okay.
Now, look, I have no problem with the
concept of Chantry having guy friends,
but if you're trying to move in...
No, no, God, I wouldn't do that.
I just want to be friends with her.
And with you.
Friends is fine. Okay?
I can do friends.
But you better not try


                                   Page 16/69

and put your penis anywhere near her.
- Okay.
- Every country has different laws,
so it's a logistical nightmare, but
I think it's important work, you know?
- I think it's worth it.
- That is impressive. Very impressive.
- Ah. Ah. Ah! Aah!
- Oh, shit.

BEN:

WALLACE:

BEN:

CHANTRY:
He's just rubbed his eye.
God! My eye! It's really burning.

- Yeah, I did.

Okay, well, do you...? Saline solution.
Do you use contacts?
- I do. It's in the bathroom.
- Ben wears contacts.

You're not paralyzed.
I'm gonna give you something
for the pain to help you relax.
Oh, my God.
What if I relax too much?
What if I lose control
of my bodily function?
What if I shit myself?
You know, that actually happens
more than you'd think.
It's the worst part of my job.

even be able to fit in the cockpit.

BEN [SINGING]:
Holy night
Shh.
[ALL HUMMING]
So, what's the prognosis, doc?
He'll need the cast
for a few more weeks,
but the, uh, neck brace
is a precaution.
And he'll probably
be out in the morning.
If you're gonna spend the night,
I can wait here with Ben.
You guys get something to eat.

CHANTRY:
What are you getting?
Tuna salad. Yeah.
- I hate hospitals.
- Mm, me too.
I spent a lot of time
in hospitals as a child.
Because of all your deformities?
- Um, no, my parents met as interns.
- Right.
He does cardiology,


                                   Page 19/69

she does orthopedics.
He actually proposed to her on the roof
of Charing Cross Hospital in London.
That's romantic.
Yeah, until the affairs.
She cheated on him,
he cheated on her.
It was just a mess.
How old were you
when they got divorced?
Uh, 7, I think.
Oh, uh, you don't know how
to teleport, do you?
- No.
- Okay.
Then I apologize for the awkward
situation you're about to witness.
Hi. Um, sorry,
Chantry, uh, this is Megan, my, urn...
Well, my nothing in particular.

CHANTRY:
Nice to meet you.
Wallace, what are you doing here?
Are you sick?
No, um, Chantry's boyfriend
fell out of a window, but he's okay.
- Do you want me to look in on him?
- No. That won't be necessary.
I'm gonna go.
We only get 15 minutes to eat lunch.
Don't get the bagel
with smoked salmon,
or the tuna, or anything with seafood.
The company that stocks the machine
has failed four inspections,
but the manager's brother
works for the mayor.
I'm sorry, I've been on shift
for 18 hours and I'm really tired.
I had so much coffee, and when I saw
her, I thought she was your girlfriend,
and that made me want to cry.
It's weird I'm saying this out loud,


                                 Page 20/69

right?
- You are, and it is.
- I just want us to be friends.
Not today, but someday.
Whatever he said,
it wasn't black-and-white...
He hasn't said anything about you.
He's never even mentioned you.
Um...
Okay, uh, it was nice to meet you.
- I hope your boyfriend feels better.

CHANTRY:
That was my ex-girlfriend.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Dude, you're really fishhooking me
over this new manual.
Is fishhooking good or bad?
- You enjoy being fishhooked?
- I've never been fishhooked.
- Take a guess.
- Probably not.
Definitely not.
Nobody wants to be fishhooked.
All those girls in high school
you fishhooked, they didn't like it.
They just wanted to have sex with me.
Uh, you. Uh, men. Men.
I'm off topic.
- God, I hope so.
- Uh, yeah. Manual.
Uh, it needs a lot of work.
So I'll give you, uh, another wee...
Uh, month.
Extra month. So make it, uh...
Make it right.
[SIGHS]

CHANTRY:
Hang on a second.
Seriously, Josh,
this is where we're doing it?
With the wood? Because I think


                                 Page 21/69

it might be cleaner someplace else.
- You're blocking the shot, so...

CHANTRY:
- Keep going, Josh.
- Douche.
It is total bullshit that Josh got
the project manager job over you.
Everyone knows it's your design,
and now Josh is acting like it's his.
- It's, like, sexism or something.
- Our boss is a woman.
Uh, I am so pissed that I gave Josh
a ho-jo after the Christmas party.
It is kind of your tradition to give one of
our coworkers a handsy for Christmas.
Shh!
Listen, guys, Holly offered me
the promotion first.
- I turned it down.

BOTH:

GRETCHEN:
- Because I like being an animator.
[GIRL GROANS]
I do, and the project manager
has to deal with so much more,
like, hassle and paperwork
and meetings,
and Josh is gonna end up
stuck in Taiwan half the year.
Yeah, all that extra power and money
and travel is gonna suck.
Stop. She doesn't want
the hassle, okay?
She's got a great job, a great boyfriend,
great friends like me, kind of you.
She's happy
just the way things are, right?
Right.
[SIGHS]
Oh, good, there they are.
Servings per pack, about 107.


                                 Page 22/69

- Oh, about.
- About.
Oh, okay. Heh-heh-heh.
Just in case you want to eat
all of it in one sitting.
That is not a good idea.
Please don't...
Please don't eat it all.

BEN:
I won't.
I wanna know
where the weird shit is.
Like, where are the animal parts
that you think are trash,
- but are actually food?
- Chantry, I've been waiting
for the right moment to, um,
talk to you about this,
but I think maybe it's better just
to stop building it up and just say it.
Okay. ls everything okay?
Oh, no, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course, yeah.
Um, okay so we've been
together five years,
and it feels like
our relationship is built to last.
No matter what the future holds.
I've been asked to take charge
of the European negotiation.
It's a six-month contract.
Um, but the thing is,
the team is based in Ireland,
so I would have to live in Dublin,
although I'd have to travel
around the whole, um, continent.
You mean the subcontinent,
- but that's okay.
- Right.
Look, this is important to me,
but there is nothing
more important than you.
So if you feel like,


                                 Page 23/69

um, the long-distance thing
is too much, I'll turn it down.
This is a huge opportunity
for you, right?
Lead negotiator?

BEN:

CHANTRY:
- Unh.

WALLACE:
Dude, I'm not saying you can't eat it.
I'm saying you'll get horribly sick.
But it wouldn't kill you.
You can eat your own poop,
but if you eat the poop
that you poop out
after eating the first poop,
it's so toxic, you'll die.
So you can eat your poop once,
but not twice.
- Unh!

NICOLE:
Okay, where did you get beer
at a children's karate tournament?
[MIMICKING] Where'd you get beer
at a children's karate tournament?
[IN NORMAL VOICE] So, Wallace, we
should get to know each other better.
Talk about the issues of our time.
Gay marriage, abortion,
can men and women really be friends,
or do you secretly
want to bang Chantry?
Thank you.
She has a boyfriend.
- Yeah, who you threw out a window.
- By accident.
Dude, listen,
Ben is moving to Dublin,
and your whole ""if it starts dirty,
it ends dirty"" thing is bullshit anyways.


                                  Page 24/69

The night I met Allan,
I was so into him,
it wasn't till I woke up the next morning
that I remembered I had a boyfriend.
Love is dirty, baby.
Sometimes it's downright filthy.
Oh, Christ.
Hey -
I need to wear something
to this company dinner
with our production partners
from Taiwan.
What do you think?
I think that's quite a dress.
CHANTRY [WHISPERING]: Do you think it's,
like, a little too slutty for me'?
- No, nothing's too slutty for you.

WOMAN:
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Yeah, actually,
um, I would like to try on that dress.
We only have the one left,
and it's a size two.
- Are you a two?
- Yes.
- I'm gonna get the measuring tape.
- I'm a two.
[GRUNTING]
[FABRIC RIPPING]
Aah!
CHANTRY [WHISPERING]:
Wallace?
- Wallace!
- Yes?
CHANTRY [IN NORMAL VOICE]:
Um, are you alone?
Like, in the universe?
No, in the hallway!
Uh, yes.
Okay, um...
- Do you need me to get someone?

CHANTRY:
I need you to come in here.


                                 Page 25/69

What?

CHANTRY:
I'm kind of stuck.
So I need you to crawl under,
but keep your eyes closed.
- Really? Uh...
- I am in a state of undress.
- You need to close your eyes.
- Okay, okay.
Promise to close your eyes
and keep them closed?
- Yes, I promise.
- Hurry!
[SIGHS THEN GRUNTS]

CHANTRY:
- I... No...

CHANTRY:
- No, I just banged my head
because my eyes are closed.
Okay, so here's what happened.
I tried it on, and I think
it got hooked on my bra or something,
- and now I can't get it off.
- Right.
You're not gonna laugh, are you?
- I can't even see what's going on.
- Okay.
Okay, um...
- Are your eyes closed?
- Yes.
I think you need to move a bit.
There, yeah.

[WALLACE GRUNTING]
- Thank you.
- It's okay.
Should I hold that?
Here, hold this.
And keep your eyes closed.
[ALLAN MOANING]
Oh, I love you so much,
I wanna just rip off your arms and legs
and carry you
around in my purse all day.
I love you so much I want
to grind up your muscles
and organs and bones
and spread you on toast.
Mm! I love you so much I want to just
cut you open and scoop out your insides
and wear your skin around town
like an Allan suit.
[BOTH MOANING]
- Okay. Bye, Wallace.
- Bye, Nicole.
[TIMER DINGS
THEN NICOLE SPEAKS IN ITALIAN]
Can I talk to you about something?
[NACHOS SIZZLING]
I just had sex.
I'm about to eat nachos!
It's the greatest moment of my life!
Unless you screw it up
with whatever you're about to say.
It's about your cousin.
She's my cousin. It's like incest.
Well, she's not my cousin.
But you're like my brother,
so it's like my brother asking my advice
on how to incestuously bang
my cousin.
No, I'm not. She...
She has a boyfriend.
Yeah. He's been over for Thanksgiving
and Christmas for the past five years.
Okay, let me break it down for you.
This perfect nacho chip is Ben.


                                 Page 27/69

He works at the United Nations as
an expert in international copyright law.
This moldy banana is you.
I have no idea what you do.
Every time you tell me, I fall asleep.
You know I write user manuals
for dedicated purchasing software.
[ALLAN SNORING]
- Like copyright law is so exciting.
- At least he's an expert in something.
What are you an expert in? Nothing.
""There are no people anywhere
seeking my advice on any subject.""
Ben's been dating Chantry
for five years.
They live together.
They own furniture.
They have a cat. You have nothing.
You don't even have a plant.
You've been single
since that douche-bag Megan
broke your fragile little heart.
Okay, okay.
I broke up with Megan, all right?
She wanted to stay together
and work it out.
I said no, so I dumped her.
Of course you did.
Anyway, I get it. It's fine.
She's in a relationship.
Nothing's gonna happen.
You totally killed
my sex nacho high.

BEN:
So...
Keys,
wallet,
Passport, phone.
Keys, wallet and... Yes, this.
It's an open ticket to Dublin.
It's a five-hour flight.
It's already paid for,
so use it whenever you want,


                                 Page 28/69

even if it's just for a weekend,
even if it's just for a day,
even if it's just for a kiss.
- Okay?
- Mm-hm.
[HORN HONKS]
No, baby, baby, I got to go.
I got to go. The cab's here.
I'm so sorry.
I can't miss my flight.
Okay, I'm so late. Okay?
Okay, baby?
Goodbye.
- Love you.
- Love you too.
Bye.
[PHONE BEEPS]
BEN [ON RECORDING]: Hey, it's me.
Sorry I missed your call.
I'm in Berlin.
Hey, it's me. I'm in Munich.
[PHONE BEEPS]
Hey, I'm in Prague.
Fm in Amsterdam. Fm in Florence.
Hey, honey, I'm in Vienna now.
[PHONE BEEPS]
I got your message.
Cell reception in Athens is a mess.
- Did you get my postcard?

CHANTRY:
Why don't you call me right before you
go to bed, even if it's a weird time here.
I just want to hear your voice.
BEN [OVER PHONE]:
So I finally got my cast off.
My arm's all smelly and shriveled.
If I felt you up, it'd be like you were
cheating on me with my evil twin.
Please, tell me more
about how you want to molest me
with your creepy, rancid freak arm.
You'd love Dublin, though.
They've got us all staying


                                 Page 29/69

in the same building,
so the whole office
is basically living together,
but I've already made
some good friends.
It's nice, but I just...
You know, I miss you so much.
Yeah, I know, I...
I really miss you too.
Look, I got to go, okay?
I love you.
Okay.

BEN:
- Okay.

BEN:
- All right, talk to you then.

BEN:
- Bye.
- Sorry.
- No worries.
- Black for you, milk for me.
- Cheers.
- Ah.
- Yep.

WALLACE:
So is Ben settling in okay?
Yeah, he's great. He's doing great.
He's having a great time.
Are you having a great time?
Not really. I'm having
kind of a crappy time, actually.
- Sorry.
- Yep, this, right now,
this is the high point
of my social calendar.
Aw. See, that is sad.
I know. I've been thinking
about just starting drinking.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


                                 Page 30/69

- Heavily.
- Heavily.
Do you need someone
to start drinking with you?
- Really?
- I'm very, very willing.
You want to help me
drown my sorrows?
Of course. Absolutely.
Done.

WALLACE:
Bottoms up!
[DANCE MUSIC
PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
- Unh!
- Oh, my God!
- Horrible!
- Horrible!
- As always!
- And cheap!
All right, prospective person
at this bar for you.
I don't think anyone I'd like
would come to a place like this.
You're here, Wallace.
- Yeah, because you dragged me here.
- So?
Look at this girl. She's so pretty.
Oh, uh, yeah.
- Yeah? No, she's super pretty!
- Yeah. Oh, okay.
You want me to go tell her
that you have six nipples?
- Yeah. No, you know what?
- All right.
No, you know what? I'll do it myself.
It'll be easier coming from me.
- Thank you.

MAN:
- I'm sorry, hi. Um...

WOMAN:


                                 Page 31/69

Oh, wow.
You've got amazing teeth.
Um, sorry, can I buy
this drink for you?
Um, yeah, that's so sweet.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Um, so...
Heh. Burn!

CHANTRY:
weirdest place you've ever had sex.
Um, bakery, night shift.
I will never be comfortable
eating a cupcake again.
[WOMAN MOANING]
- What about you?
- Um...
Ferris wheel.
Stuck at the very top.
We could see for miles around,
but no one could see us.
- Aah!
- Yes! Oh, yeah!
Thank you for being
so gracious in victory.
- Whoo! Uh-huh!
- Hand clasp of champions.
Rub it in.
[POP MUSIC
PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
So how many serious relationships
have you actually had?
Four! Two in high school,
and one in college before Ben,
and then Ben.
- You?
- Six?
One in high school,
one the summer after high school,
three in college, and one since.
No, sorry, two since. So seven.
Are you usually
the dumper or dumpee?


                                 Page 32/69

Um, statistically, I'm a dumper,
but it's not like I've never been dumped.
I've just been really good
at knowing when to get out.
- You?
- No, I've never dumped anyone.
I always try to make it work.
You know, I haven't hit the bar scene
in, like, a very long time.
I thought it was gonna be the worst,
but that was surprisingly painless.
I'm just sorry
you didn't find true love tonight.
Ah, well, you can't have it all.
And what's the worst thing
that's ever happened to you?
Um, the worst thing
that's ever happened to me
is kind of the best thing
that's ever happened to me.
Megan, you met the other day,
I burst in on her making out with our,
frankly, gross anatomy professor,
and I was like,
""Wow, we actually are my parents.
We are almost both doctors,
and we already started cheating
on each other.""
So I got out of there, and yeah.
So, in a way, that became
the best thing
that ever happened to me.
So, what is the worst thing
that ever happened to you?
My mom died
when I was in junior high.
Um...
She had breast cancer.
You don't realize how quickly
everything can fall apart until it does.
Makes you never want to give up
anything good ever again.
Can I change my answer?
The worst thing


                                 Page 33/69

that happened to me
is saying
my lame relationship drama
is the worst thing
that happened to me,
when something really awful
happened to you.
It's okay.
I like your answer.
Plus, I get to be part of
the worst part of your life now.
That's really good.
And for future reference,
when the answer is
your mom died of cancer,
you should really go first.
All right.
Thanks for the etiquette lesson.
No worries.
Good night, Wallace.
Good night, Chantry.

CHANTRY:
he has all these new experiences,
he's meeting
all these new people.
And then,
What's going on with you?""
And it's like, ""Well, I'm in the middle
of my same old life,
except, whoops,
my boyfriend's out of the country.""

TABBY:
Ugh!
So Dolly was telling us
about this Wallace guy...?
We're friends.
Well, no, I know, obviously
you guys are friends, but is he cute?
Should you be introducing him
to your single,
desperate friends like me?
No, no, I already called dibs on him.


                                   Page 34/69

Why?
He was supposed to be my rebound.
That's why it didn't work with Noel.
I needed a buffer
between Rob and Noel.
A buffer made of sex.

GRETCHEN:
You little prostitute.
- Dalia, you barely know him.

DALIA:
You hang out with him all the time,
so he's not a loser.
He hasn't made some
creepy move on you,
so we know he's not a creep.
He's vetted.

TABBY:
Well, is he funny or smart?
He's definitely smart.
He's not funny.
He's, like, kind of, like, bantery.
He's kind of like a male version
of Chantry, actually.
- Oh, wait, so he's Mantry?

TABBY:

DALIA:
- No. No, We're not...

TABBY:
sex with her sister's man-twin.

ALLAN:
Option one, make a move on her.
Bold, direct.
If you're lucky, you hook up,
she feels guilty, breaks up with Ben.
If you're unlucky, she's furious,
ends your friendship.
- So be sleazy?


                                  Page 35/69

- Yeah.

WALLACE:

ALLAN:
Even if she goes for it, she'll
resent you for getting her to cheat.
She'll break up with him, but she won't
go out with you because you're...
- Sleazy.
- Yeah.
Option two,
be the guy she goes to for advice.
The downside is you have to listen
to her talk about Ben.
The upside is you can slant your
advice to slowly turn her against him.
- So be conniving?
- Yeah.
- And that'll work?
- Maybe.
Maybe she'll see through it
and think you're...
- Conniving?
- Yeah.
Option three, patiently wait it out.
Either the distance
gets to them and they break up,
or it doesn't, and they get married,
live a happy life,
with you always on the outside,
looking in, quietly pining indefinitely.
- So be pathetic?
- Yeah.
That sounds fun.
It's got the advantage
of not being unethical,
but the disadvantage of being...
- Pathetic.
- Yeah.
So your advice is be sleazy,
conniving or pathetic.
Well, when you put it that way,
it doesn't sound like very good advice.


                                 Page 36/69

[ALLAN SHUDDERS]

WALLACE:
Aw...
- Oh, my God.
- Do you like it?
Um, well,
it's not my engagement ring.
- It's whether she'll like it.
- I think she'll love it.

WALLACE:
Then you're made for each other.
Why'd you get all snaky when we
were talking about Wallace earlier?
I... Ugh.
Come on.
Look, you just, like...
You don't have the greatest
track record with guys. That's all.
You think I'm gonna break his heart
and mess up your friendship?
No.
So you think I'm not
good enough for him?
Obviously not.
That's obviously not what it is.
Some of us
aren't as lucky as you and Ben.
Some of us want a guy
that doesn't make us feel like crap.
There is a fourth option.
- Yeah?
- Be honest.
Tell her how you feel.
It might ruin the friendship,
but at least you
Stood up like a man
and expressed your feelings.
Wait, I'm sorry.
Since when does being a man
involve expressing your feelings?
Did I miss a memo?
Because if I recall,


                                 Page 37/69

being a man meant
hiding your feelings forever.
Like Bruce Willis. You never see
Bruce Willis expressing feelings.
The most you ever get out of Bruce
is a hint of melancholy
- at the edge of a smirk.
- Do you think Bruce
would be happy just being friends?
A hundred percent honesty
is the foundation of any relationship.
You are a hundred percent honest
with Nicole?
- Yes. Yep.
- About everything.
New Orleans, 2006?
What was her name?
Uh, Favia?
Yeah, she did look like a woman,
to be fair.
Ninety-nine percent honesty
is the foundation of any relationship.
You know, it's not worth the risk,
not if it means losing her as a friend.
- Well, so then it's option five.
- What's that?
You move on.
[CHATTERING]
Hello.

CHANTRY:

WALLACE:
Hello, welcome.
Welcome to our engagement party.
We are so happy to have everybody
we care about together in one space.
Here's the thing, we both
really want to get married, but...
But we hate weddings. Every wedding
I've been to has completely sucked.
Sorry, uh, Aunt Cathy,
Uncle Drew and Olivia.
And we don't like long engagements,


                                 Page 38/69

so we are getting married
here, tonight.
[CHATTERING]
Zella is our registered civil officiant.

NICOLE:
I got your wedding dress altered.
I hope that's okay.
Becky's gonna be
Nicole's maid of honor.
- Wallace...

WALLACE:
...is gonna be my best man.
Thank you very much.
Everyone stay away
from my Uncle Herman. All right.
[APPLAUDING AND CHEERING]
Okay, I... Like, I don't need you
finger-combing my wisps. I'm serious.
- You look pretty.

WALLACE:
I've been sent to get an ETA.
- Oh, is that Wallace?

WALLACE:
Just come in.
Oh, wow, you look amazing.
Yes. Becky, seriously,
if I don't get some alcohol,
I'm gonna panic.

WALLACE:
- No, no, no, you stay.
Becky's more nervous than I am, and
frankly, it's wigging me out. Now, go.
You, stay, talk to me.
[SIGHS]
- So...
- So?
- So.
- What?
Why are you torturing yourself


                                    Page 39/69

over a ten-second conversation with
Chantry that would answer everything?
It's your wedding day.
- Can we talk about you?
- Exactly. It's my wedding day.
As best man,
it's your job to keep me calm
so that I don't crawl out that window
and go and bang a sailor.
- Where are you gonna find a sailor?
- At the dock.
God, what's the best-case scenario?
""Wallace, I love you. Let's have sex
forever until we die having sex""?
That is the best-case scenario.
Okay, and what's
the worst-case scenario?
""Wallace, you shit-drizzling liar.
This whole time, you've just been
trying to put your junk inside my trunk.""
Anything involving the phrase
put your junk inside my trunk""
actually would be
the worst-case scenario.
Look, the one thing
I like about getting married
is that you get to stand up
in front of everyone you care about
and state, for the record, that you
believe in the best-case scenario.
It terrifies me,
but that's why the outfits
are so nice.
[DOOR OPENS]
Okay.
[MENDELSSOHN'S ""WEDDING
MARCH"" PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
- Thanks.
- Cheers.
[NICOLE WHOOPS]
[CROWD CHEERING]

ALLAN:
I got her! She's mine! My wife.


                                  Page 40/69

Yeah. Mommy!

WALLACE:
I can't believe no one stopped that.
Nice.
And I learned a lot of lessons that night
about gambling addictions
and identity theft
and the Romanian legal system,
but the most important lesson
I learned was from Nicole,
and it was about friendship.
I love you, Nicole.
Oh, so much fun.

WOMAN 1:

WOMAN 2:
Look at you.
You didn't even practice.

DALIA:
Whoo! Go, Wallace!

CHANTRY:

WALLACE:
To those of us who begrudgingly
call Allan a friend...
[MAN CHUCKLES]
...it seems impossible that any woman
could handle him for an hour,
let alone a lifetime.
And then you meet Nicole,
and that is the good news here.
Um, if these two can find each other,
then there truly
is somebody for everyone.
The bad news is that one day,
they will procreate,
and their hideous offspring
will obviously cause the Apocalypse.
But tonight,
we celebrate the good news.


                                 Page 41/69

I remember the night
Allan and Nicole met,
and that instant connection.
You know, if you're lucky,
it happens once in a lifetime,
and if you're unlucky,
then you have to come to weddings
and hear people like me
talking about it,
and assume that we are all
hopeless romantics.
Um...
It's very easy
to be cynical about love,
but this, tonight,
this is hard.
So to Allan and Nicole,
for making the hard way
look easy.

ALL:

WOMAN 3:

WALLACE:
All right, thanks, everyone.
Um...
Yep. That's it.
[POP MUSIC
PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]
[LAUGHING]
Perfect timing.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Are you sure?
It's so near here for me.
Oh, yeah, no, I'm all about
the door-to-door service.
- Heh.
- Okay.
- Let me out?

CHANTRY:

WALLACE:


                                    Page 42/69

Unh. Oh, gosh. German cars.
Good night.
Wallace, you clean up nice.
Yes, so do you.
- Okay.
- Good night.

CHANTRY:
Bye!
- Bye.
- Bye.
Great. Thank you very much.
Listen,
I don't think it's a good idea for me
to come inside with you.
- What?
- Heh. Don't get all mad.
If you're gonna get mad,
I guess we could make out,
- but we are not having sex.
- Uh, no.
Um, I'm not sure that's a good idea.
Why? Because I won't
have sex with you? Pfft.
That's really nice, Wallace.
Uh, no, that's not what I meant.
[CHUCKLES]
I know, I'm just kidding.
Oh, right.
What part are you kidding about?
- All of it.
- I'm very confused by this conversation.
Fine, let's go inside.
[DALIA MOANING]
- Dude, my sister. Sweet score.
- Um, no, this isn't what it looks like.
Well, okay.
Yeah, it is, it is what it looks like.
She's super-hot. Plus, she's 99 percent
genetically identical to me, so...
Anyway, have fun
making out with my sister.
Um, actually, just FYI,
if you do go through with this,


                                 Page 43/69

you can be pretty much
absolutely positive
I will never, ever, ever, ever
have sex with you ever.
Bam!
Ever!
Um, I'm sorry.
Dalia, I... Look, I think... I think
you're great, but, um, I can't do this.
Heh. Great?
You think I'm great? I don't...
I don't throw myself at guys,
like, ever.
I made an exception for you because
you were cute, and you think I'm great?
- Great?
- Um...
- Get the fuck out!
- Sorry.
- Um...
- God, get your...
- Get out faster!
- Okay, I'm going!
- Ow!
- I can't believe I got a Brazilian for this!
- Goodbye!
- Jesus!
[LINE RINGING]
BEN [OVER PHONE]: Hello?
- [WHISPERING] Ben. Hi.
- Hi. Are you okay?
- Hi.
It's the middle of the night there.
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
I'm really good.
- I'm really just a little bit drunk.
- Okay, but...
And I'm wearing
such a fancy, fancy dress.
- I see.
- Um, hang on a second.
- But...
- Hang on a second.
Listen very closely, okay?


                                 Page 44/69

- Okay.
- Really closely.
But...
- Do you hear that?
- Mm-hm, I can, but...
That's the sound of me unzipping
my very, very fancy dress
- Well, that's good news.
- that I happen to be wearing
really cute panties under.
- You are?
- And also, like, a bra
that totally, totally matches.
- Chantry...
- Can you picture me in them?
[WHISPERING]
Hey, can you picture me out of them?
I... I... I definitely can.
The thing is, I'm just in the, uh, middle
of the Brazilian presentation now.
That's not to say I, um,
don't fully support the concept.
It sounds very interesting.
And, um, I would love to continue
discussing it at a later time.
Okay, I'll confirm. Bye.
[PHONE BEEPS]
Sir. Please, carry on.
- It's good?
- Oh, yeah.

DALIA:
happened with Wallace the other night.

CHANTRY:
I'm respecting your privacy.
He's a big, stupid, fat jerk.
I hate him.
Okay.
He propositioned me.
He said, like, dirty, disgusting
things he wanted to do to me.
Me, your little sister.
That's so terrible.


                                   Page 45/69

I know, and so I told him,
""I'm not that kind of girl,""
and he just, like, flew into a rage,
and he attacked me and tried to break
all my fingers and poke my eyeballs out.
So the cops had to come
and pull him off me.
- The cops came?
- Yeah.
And then he just shot them all
in the face, and they all died.
And some of them had kids
and they'll never know their father.
He didn't even care.
He was just, like, laughing
and shooting them all,
and he had a huge chubby.
And then he said he was gonna
come to your house and kill you
while you were sleeping.
Yeah, that sounds
exactly like Wallace.
Have you talked to him lately?
No.
So he didn't say anything about me
completely humiliating myself
in front of him?
No.
He's a big, stupid, ugly jerk,
and you shouldn't be friends
with him anymore.
Okay.
Look how pregnant
I can make myself look.
[CHANTRY LAUGHS]
You want to feel my baby?
It's so hard.
- Oh, my God, it kicked!
- Shut up. Heh-heh.
I'm gonna make you raise it.
[BOTH LAUGH]

HOLLY:
I'm firing Josh.


                                 Page 46/69

The Taiwan team hates him,
nobody listens to him.
On the plus side, I hear
he's banging enough Taiwanese girls
to qualify for
the douche-bag Olympics.
So there's a silver lining.
That's, um, unfortunate.
I need someone full-time in Taiwan
to clean up Josh's mess.
I want it to be you.
I mean, this whole thing
is your concept.
If we had had you as project manager
from the start,
- we'd have saved a lot of time.
- Honestly, I just...
I don't even know if I would enjoy
being the project manager, so...
You get an apartment, car,
language lessons.
- Yeah.
- Obviously a raise.
I need your answer
by the end of the month.
And to be clear, this is the last time
I offer you a promotion.
Okay. I got it.
Holly, um...
I'm gonna think about it,
I promise.

to name Cool Whip,
they came up with 10,000 ideas.
Like, they brainstormed
10,000 ideas.
And none of them
were as good as Cool Whip?
No, Cool Whip was the best.
That's what they said.


                                  Page 47/69

And they said, ""Just try to, like,
think of, like, ten of your own,""

- Whip-Whippy-Whippy Pippitins.
[ALL LAUGH]
- So how many is that?
- I don't know.
- Yeah, it's not that hard.
- No.
- No.
- Let's go swimming!
[ALLAN GRUNTS]
- I didn't bring my suit, did you?

NICOLE:

ALLAN:

NICOLE:
[GRUNTS]

NICOLE:

ALLAN:


                                 Page 48/69

Are you gonna come get me?
Aah! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

ALLAN:
Ow! You're hitting me!

NICOLE:

ALLAN:
- Ooh! It's cold! It's cold!

NICOLE:

ALLAN:
It's cold.

ALLAN [SINGING]:
It's cold!

NICOLE:
Allan!
Ow! Don't!
Do you want to go swimming?
Yeah.
Do you think it'll be cold?
Yep.
You've got a tattoo.
Yeah.
- Yeah, it's, um...
- it... I know, it's...
It's your mom, right?
- Oh, God!
- What?
Something just...
Something just touched my foot.
- Okay.
- No, it was really gross.

WALLACE:
- It's not funny.

WALLACE:
That was funny.
Oh...


                                  Page 49/69

- Oh, wow.
- Oh, yeah. Wow.
[WALLACE CHUCKLES]

CHANTRY:
Wallace?

WALLACE:
Yes?
I'll look if you look.
Okay.
Where are our clothes?

WALLACE:
- No, the fire's right there.
Yeah, they took our clothes.

CHANTRY:
Oh, God.
The car is gone.
God, how'd it get so cold?
it wasn't cold at all before.
It was, like, a warm night.
Okay, um, you keep the sleeping bag
and I will figure something out.
No, I can't let you just, like,
spend the night on the sand,
like, all cold and wet
and naked like a walrus.
[LAUGHS]
Do you think that's funny?
Do you think this is, like,
some hilarious prank
played on us by our wacky pals?
Because I don't.
I thought you were trying
to lighten the mood
with a mildly amusing joke
involving a walrus.
I'm sorry if I misunderstood the
seriousness of your walrus reference.
Don't be an asshole.
- I'm not being an arsehole.
- You are. You are being an asshole.


                                 Page 50/69

You're not taking this seriously, and you're
treating it like a joke, and it's not.
There is a line, a line that should not
be crossed, and they crossed it.
And you know what? Treating it
like a joke is being an asshole.
I'm not treating this like a joke,
and I am not being an arsehole.
Allan is being an arsehole,
Nicole is being an arsehole,
and right now,
you are being an arsehole.
Me? I'm standing here with a branch.
A branch that cuts down zero percent
of the wind-chill factor on my dick.
I've got a branch,
you've got a sleeping bag.
How does that make me an arsehole?
- Fine.
- Fine? What does ""fine"" mean?
Fine! It means we'll share.

WALLACE:
Ah.
- Chantry?
- What?
They brought our clothes back.

ALLAN:
- Mm-hm.

NICOLE:
Hey, you guys have fun last night?

ALLAN:
Hey.
- Sleep well?

WALLACE:
[PEOPLE LAUGHING]
[BOTH SPEAKING IN SPANISH]

CHANTRY:
Ben.


                                 Page 51/69

Chantry?
[JULIANNE SCREAMS
THEN CHANTRY GASPS]

BEN:
the Argentinean team.
She lives in the apartment
next door.
A bunch of us went for a drink after
work, and I was just helping her home.
Ben, I'm not accusing you
of anything.

JULIANNE:
You need not worry about his fidelity.
I'm not some beautiful
but morally corrupt Argentine girl.
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?
Because I wanted
to surprise you.
Surprise.
Okay, I need to go
to my apartment now,
and stuff old socks in my ears
so I don't hear your lovemaking
through the wall.
And I'm keeping this meat.

BEN:
Sorry, you... You startled me.
This isn't how I planned
to welcome you to Dublin.
Are you still startled?
Should I get you some warm milk?
Welcome to Dublin.
[CHATTERING]
So, um, I was reading this thing
about, uh,
how when they were trying to come up
with the name for Cool Whip,
- they brainstormed 10,000 ideas...
- What is Cool Whip?
It's a kind of processed cream.


                                 Page 52/69

Comes in a spray can.
- Ah!
- Or in a tub.
I've had the Cool Whip.
I prefer the fresh whipped cream.
Well, when they were trying to come
up with the name for that product,
uh, they brainstormed
10,000 ideas,
and they said try to come up with ten
of your own just to see how hard it is.
Like Puffy Whip,
or Whip... Wiffy Puff.
Puffy Air. Whippy Air.
Um, Cow Mixture?
- Sweet Dreams?
- Sweet Dreams.
Cotton Vul-candi-cow?
It could be one.
Cloudy Cow?
So you must be
really proud of our Benji.
- Yeah.
- He has the Brazilians on the run.
Heh-heh-heh. You know he has
the whole negotiation in his hands?
We're so happy that he's able
to stay another six months.
And his Portuguese
is really coming on.
He's going to be so good
by the time we get to Rio de Janeiro...

BEN:
I haven't accepted the offer yet.
Obviously, I was planning
on talking to you about it first,
but I mean, I love it here.
Not just the work.
The people, the culture, the music.
You never asked me
to move here with you.
When you got the job,
you never asked me to come.


                                 Page 53/69

I didn't want to ask you
to quit a job.
- And I mean, you never offered.
- You never asked.
Well, okay,
I'm asking you now.
I mean, there must be
animation companies here.
I couldn't do that to Holly.
She's been generous
giving me this week
to make my decision.
Okay, so take the job.
it doesn't have to be a bad thing.
You'd be in Taipei, I'd be here.
We can meet in the middle.
Like in Toronto?
No, like Tel Aviv,
Istanbul, Mumbai...
It'll be a story
we can tell our kids.
- It's romantic.
- Sounds lonely.
Look, I'm just trying
to make this work, okay?
Don't you wanna make this work?
Did you guys want to borrow
some of my balls?
I think someone sharted
and it might be Mrs. Cole.
Everyone, check.
Check. Sham check.
You can look it up
on Urban Dictionary.
Fail. You couldn't find that stone
if it was in your kidney.
I can see your back acne
through your blouse.

WALLACE:
spewing out joy like a shit Santa.
- Yep.

WALLACE:


                                 Page 54/69

Nicole's spending the night
at Becky's.
We had a fight.
First fight as a married couple.
Ta-da! You want a beer?
Sure.
So, um...
I'm sorry, okay?
I let Nicole talk me into it,
even though I knew it was a bad idea.
I'm not like you.
I can't hook up with somebody
if they're already with someone else.
It's wrong. It was wrong
when my parents did it to each other,
it was wrong
when Megan did it to me.
It was wrong when you and Nicole
did it to her ex.
You don't think the fact
that we got married kind of justifies it?
Not unless you want to be married
to someone who doesn't mind cheating.
Hey, that's my wife, okay?
Nicole talks a good game, but she's
been hurt like everybody else.
Her ex was a dick.
He treated her real bad.
It's complicated.
All this love shit's complicated.
And that's good.
Because if it's too simple,
you've got no reason to try.
And if you got no reason to try,
you don't.
Oh. Oh... Wait, I just described you.
You know what? Maybe you're right.
But either way,
you're an arsehole, Allan.
Hit a three-pointer!
[SIGHS]
[KNOCKING]
- Hi.
- Hi.


                                 Page 55/69

Come in or whatever.
Uh...
I just jogged over here
to feed the cat.
If I don't shower right away
my pores get all clogged
and I get this, like, zit nest
on my forehead.
So, uh, why are you
feeding the cat?
So it doesn't starve to death.
- But why can't Chantry feed it?
- Because she flew to Dublin.
She flew to Dublin?
Yes, of course she did.
You like her.
[DALIA SCOFFS]
You like Chantry.
Get in the shower.
I can see your blackheads from here.
No, don't get all snooty with me
just because you're so busted.
Look,
I'm not in love with your sister.
You are a nice-ish guy,
and you're amusing,
but Chantry loves Ben.
They're gonna get married
and live happily ever after.
You're just gonna be this guy that she
was friends with for a couple months.
""What was his name...?
Walter? I don't know.""
So you just need to do whatever
you need to do to get over it, okay?
Because it's never gonna happen.

WOMAN [OVER PA]:
Dublin and thank you for flying with us.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Okay.
She's gone.
Is she coming back?
[WALLACE GRUNTING]


                                 Page 56/69

[THUNDER RUMBLING]
CHANTRY [ON RECORDING]:
Hey, Wallace, it's Chantry.
I'm getting on a plane right now,
and I'm wondering
if you're free for lunch tomorrow
at, like, noon,
at the George Street Diner?
Uh, there's something
I want to talk to you about.
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Taxi!
George Street Diner!
Shit!
Excuse me!
[EXHALES SHARPLY]
[DOOR OPENS]

CHANTRY:
- Hey.
Oh, my God,
what did you do to yourself?
Oh, um, ninja attack.
Oh! The stupid ninjas.
- I know.
- I hate them.
Me too. Very annoying.
Oh, thank you.
I'm good.
- How you doing? Heh.
- Hi.
So I went to Dublin, right?
- Right. Yes.
- Yes. Listen...
There's a bunch of stuff
going on with me
that I haven't told you about
because...
...I haven't been sure
what the right thing to do is.
Wallace, your face
just looks terrible.
Oh, no, don't worry about it, really.


                                    Page 57/69

Um, what were you gonna say?
Okay, so... Just that...
I've been having to do
a lot of big-picture thinking about...
Wallace, seriously, I cannot concentrate
because of your mangled head.
What did you do to yourself?
Did you hit yourself with something?
Car accident?
Did you walk into a door...?
Ben punched me.
I flew to Dublin.
Why did you fly to Dublin?
To tell you how I feel about you.
- That's not why.
- Well, I wanted to be honest with you.
You could have been
honest with me any time.
You flew to Dublin
to break up me and Ben.
Right?
Uh...
How long have you felt this way?
Pretty much since the clay we met.
So...
...when I said ""I have a boyfriend
and I just want to be friends""
and you said that's what
you wanted too, that was a lie?
- No. No. I wanted that to be true.
- But it wasn't.
- You never wanted to be my friend.
- We are friends.
I haven't just been trying to
put my junk inside your trunk.
I told Ben you weren't that kind of guy,
but you're totally that kind of guy.
God, he must think I'm such an idiot.
You must think I'm such an idiot.
- Of course not.
- I trusted you.
I trusted we were
what we said we were: friends.
But you can't be friends


                                 Page 58/69

if you're skulking around
waiting for some opportunity
to screw them.
No! Look...
What are you talking about?
I'm not...
It's not like you've caught me
bathing in orphan blood
or masturbating in your kitchen.
I just...
I like you a little bit more romantically
than I let on.
It's not a crime.
And if it is,
you're not exactly innocent.
What's that supposed to mean?
You crossed all the same lines I did,
and I was single. You weren't.
I've never cheated on anybody.
And now you're making me feel like
I somehow cheated on Ben?
Wait. Hold on.
I'm making you feel like that?
What, and you did nothing
that I might possibly misconstrue?
That night on the beach?
""I'll look if you look""?
I mean...
What, did you tell Ben about that?
That was a mistake.
This was a mistake.
- I'm leaving.
- Please...
- No, Chantry, please...
- No, I'm leaving the country.
- You're moving to Dublin?
- No.
I've been offered a job in Taiwan.
I'm putting my career first.
So I'll be gone soon,
for a year.
Maybe more.
It's a really big promotion.
Congratulations.


                                 Page 59/69

See you around, Wallace.
- Uncle Wallace?
- Not right now, Felix.

FELIX:
- Felix, I said not right now!
I'm having a bad life.
What are you doing
that's so important
that you don't have time
for your nephew?
I'm not the kid's dad, all right?
- He's your responsibility, not mine.
- Fine.
I'm a bad mom.
And when Felix grows up,
he can blame me
for all his problems
and the circle of life can continue.
I'm doing the best I can.
Which is all any of us can do,
except you.
You are not doing
the best you can do! You...
[GASPS]
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Are you choking?
Okay, I'm gonna try and Heimlich you.
Unh. Okay. Again.
[ELLIE GASPS]
- Big one!
- Unh!

WALLACE:
Oh, God.
[ELLIE PANTING]
Ellie, you know
you're not a bad morn, right?
It wasn't my plan that you should be
my son's primary male role model.
But you are.

DALIA:
Mm... Mine.


                                 Page 60/69

Gross.
This expired months ago.
Yeah, it's probably Ben's.
So that's it?
You're just gonna throw it away?
Let me guess,
we're not talking about salsa.
I just think you're making
a huge mistake.
- You really think Taiwan's a mistake?
- Yes, I do.
I think you're totally
screwing up your life, actually.
[DALIA SIGHS]
Or not, maybe?
I just don't have any idea
what I'm doing.
I'm gonna be all the way over there,
and I'm not gonna have anybody.
I'm gonna be all alone, and I'm gonna
have all these responsibilities,
and then...
And you're gonna be so far away.
And Ben and...
And there's, you know...
Wallace?
Yeah.
Yeah. Have you heard from him?
No, but I think
I messed it up really bad.
I called him a liar.
And I think that I might be the liar.
- No.
- Yes.
I mean, I think it might count as lying
if you lie to yourself.
No. Come here.

WALLACE:
turned out for the best.
I'm, um...
I'm going back to med school.
- I sent in my application today.
- Oh. So you just gave up?


                                    Page 61/69

Mm? No.
I'm not giving up. I'm going...
I'm getting back to the life
I was supposed to have by now.
When you're old and wrinkled
and your penis doesn't work anymore...
Not that it's in great shape now.
But in that old, wrinkled, dickless future,
will this seem like the right call?
Yes. I'll think dropping out of med
school because of a girl was stupid.
Not chasing after a girl who doesn't
want me was definitely smart.
I'm a doctor now.
I've saved probably millions of lives,
because I'm brilliant.
I cured the zombie epidemic.
You remember that?
I found the cure,
so you can all be grateful,
shut up and stop
questioning my decisions.

ALLAN:

WALLACE:
Well, it was supposed
to be a secret,
but loose lips over here
knocked me up.
- Oh, shit!

ALLAN:
You got a baby in you!

NICOLE:
- Congratulations!
Oh, that means the Apocalypse
has really started.
- That's great!

NICOLE:
And you're the first person we told,
so you can't be mad at us anymore.


                                 Page 62/69

You have to forgive pregnant people
for anything they've ever done to you.
- It's like a federal law.
- Deal.
Wow.
I can't wait to meet this kid.

NICOLE:
Yeah. And...
...we're having a going-away party
for Chantry,
and you should come to it
to say goodbye.
No.
No, we already said our goodbyes.
[CHATTERING]
- Wallace?
- No.
- It's nice.
- So slutty.
- No, it's not.
- Yeah, it is.
No, I think mine are normal
and yours are tiny.
[ALL LAUGH]

GRETCHEN:
I don't want you to leave.
- No.
- Me neither.
I'm sorry I'm late.

CHANTRY:
Bye. Skype me.
Be careful.
Take care of yourselves.
- I'm never gonna Skype.
- Call me tomorrow.

DALIA:
Bye.

CHANTRY:
- Hey.


                                 Page 63/69

- How are you?
- I'm great. How are you?

WALLACE:
- Good.
Um, so your new job
is going to be amazing.
Um, and you get to live in Asia.
- Yeah.
- I hear Taiwan is incredible.
Yeah, and you're gonna
go back to med school.
Yeah. Yes.
That is so great.
You think so?
No. Actually, I've always hated doctors,
so I pretty much think
you've become the Antichrist.
Right. And Taiwan is shit.
That was... Everything I said
a second ago was a lie.
And you're gonna have
an awful time because
- Chantry means ""syphilitic woman.""
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Well, at least it will be accurate.
- Yeah, right. Exactly.
- Yeah...
So how long until you see,
um, people just as, like,
slabs of meat that you can cut up
and sew back together,
and not, like, actual people
with, like, real feelings?
Oh, God,
hopefully as soon as possible.
I mean, I've been practicing at night
on tiny, defenseless animals
and homeless people.
Oh, good. That's actually what
homeless people are there for.
- Yes, I know.
- Yeah.
- They're all just bodies in waiting.


                                 Page 64/69

- Especially for a sociopath.
Especially for... Yeah, that...
But that's been my goal,

as you know:
just to feel nothing.
Yeah, it wouldn't be
such a bad idea sometimes.
- So Dublin...
- It's okay.
No, it's not. I'm really sorry.
It was stupid, and I know Ben is
a good guy and he didn't deserve that.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So are you two okay?
I'm not sure.
About anything.
So I got really creative
when I was cleaning out my fridge.
- Did you?
- And, um...
I, uh...
I made you that.
It's, um... It's Fool's Gold.
I even coated the loaf in butter
as you are supposed to.
That's the real thing.
I can't believe you did this.
This is your going-away present.
[PAPER TEARING]
I don't know what to say.
So I've thought a lot
about something you said.
About how,
when you realize how quickly
everything can fall apart,
it makes you never want to give up
anything good ever again.
Whatever this is between us,
it is good.
It is so good.
It is actually the best thing
that has ever happened to me,


                                  Page 65/69

and I don't want it to be over.
I don't want it to be over, either.
I kind of wish, you know, like,
we could invent
a time machine or something.
- If we ever invent time travel...
- Yeah?
...I would go back
to the night we met.
- You would?
- Yes.
What would you do differently?
Nothing.
Me too.
[PLANE ENGINE ROARING]
Hey, Walter.
- Wallace.
- Oh, sorry.
It's just so weird seeing you here.
Yeah, really weird.
- Where have you just come in from?
- Taiwan.
You've been in Taiwan
this whole time?
Yeah, I was, and then I was doing
some traveling with my, um, fianc.
You got engaged?
Uh, yeah.
- Wow. Yeah, no, me too.
- Oh!
I don't know why I did that.
I have nothing on this hand.
So who is the incredibly lucky guy?
He's just this dude who stalked me
all the way to Taiwan.
That's a coincidence. I followed
my fiancee to Taiwan as well,
but I made out with her sister first.
I'm a bad-arse.
Come here.
[HORN HONKS]
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

CHANTRY:


                                 Page 66/69

DALIA:
I'm so happy you're home!
[CRYING]
She loved it.

WALLACE:
Mm.
Three!
[ALL SCREAMING]
Oh, please,
he's not even a real doctor.
He's a real doctor.
He finished his degree.
- Allan, in Asia. We're not Asian.

ALLAN:
- Wine, please.

NICOLE:
After you have a baby,
if you eat the placenta,
does it count as cannibalism?
You know that's not
a medical question, right?
If a baby's hand is bigger
than its face, will it have cancer?
No, it just means your baby
has massive hands.
[BABY FARTING]
- Oh. What's going on here? Hoo-hoo.
- Oh, Jesus.
Oh, it smells bad. Wait, can you write
us a prescription or not? Oh, God.
There goes my husband.
I can't believe you have a husband.
- It's crazy.
- You're weirding me out.

WALLACE:

CHANTRY:

WALLACE:


                                 Page 67/69

Careful. Give me your hand.
- You're up here alone, like a total loser.
- Yeah, but who's the bigger loser?
Me for escaping up here,
or you for agreeing to marry me?
- No, that's me.
- Heh-heh.
If I fell, do you think I'd die,
or just become massively paralyzed?
Probably just paralyzed.

CHANTRY:
You'd have to stay married to me.
If you didn't, people would be like,
""He divorced his wife after she became
paralyzed from the waist down.""
- From the waist down?
- Yeah.
So everything would still work
down there, though, right?
Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't be able
to feel anything, but...
I really don't even need you
to feel anything now.
I don't want the sex
to be too good
- right away.
- Mm-hm.
I'm intentionally being much worse
in bed than I actually am
so that it can just
keep getting better forever.
But, like, very slowly,
over many, many decades
so that we hit our sexual peak
in our 90s.
Yeah. That's the plan, actually,
is if the last time we have sex is also
the best and that it actually kills you.
That wouldn't be
such a bad way to go.
- We should head back soon, right?
- Yes.
Or we could stay here


                                 Page 68/69

for another minute.
Or maybe like forever.

    CARD:      TEN YEARS AGO

    A couple     in a clinch.
    The young man involved   is named HARRYBURNS. He's 26
    years old, just graduated   from law school. Wearing
    jeans and a sweatshirt.
    He's kissing    a young woman named AMANDA. She has long
    straight   hair that she irons.    She's about 20.  The
    embrace is fairly    melodramatic.   They pull back to look
    at one another.
                                         AMANDA
                  I love you.
                                         HARRY
                  I love     you.
    They begin     to kiss      again.
                                                                 (CONTINUED)

            2     A car pulls        up right   beside    them.    Stops.         Sits     there.                   2

                  Driving the car is SALLY ALBRIGHT. She's 21 years old.
                  She's very pretty   although not necessarily         in an
                  obvious way. She sits there waiting         for the kiss to
                  end.   It doesn't  end.    She clears    her throat.     They
                  don't hear her.    She shifts   position    and accidentally-
                  on-purpose  hits the car HORN, which beeps and startles
                  Amanda and Harry into breaking off their clinch.
                  Amanda sees Sally,   and she and Harry move over to the
                  car.
                                                 AMANDA
                             Oh. Hi, Sally.        Sally -- this            is

                                can start.
                  Harry   looks      meaningfully    at Amanda.
                  Then he starts    to put his stuff -- a duffel bag, a box
                  of records    -- into the back seat of the car, where
                  Sally's   stuff is, too -- suitcases,  stereo speakers, a
                  guitar,   boxes of books, a small TV.

                     The story of my life isn't  even
                     going to get u~ out of Chicago.    I
                     mean, nothing's  happened to me yet.
                     That's why I'm going to New York.

                     happen to other people.

                     Suppose nothing happens to you.

                     never meet anyone and you never
                     become anything and finally     you die

     IT'S   FIVE YEARSLATER.
     A   couple    in a clinch.
     The woman is Sally at 26.    She looks great,    she's a
     stylish-young·woman~-  She •s ki--ssing a very attractive
     man with·a beard, although it""s not that easy to see
     him at the moment. His name is JOE.
     Harry is coming down the hallway of the airline
     terminal.    He""s wearing a suit and tie and trenchcoat;
     he has a kind of attractive-but-rumpled      demeanor.  He
     notices   the couple kissing.     Goes past them.  Then
     stops.    Backs up.  Berecognizes them.
     They're      still      kissing.
     Harry comes closer,                peers     at the two of them from
     slightly     too close.             It's     not easy to s- either   of
     their    faces.      ·
     Finally,      Sally and Joe become aware that someone is
     standing      nearby, and they stop kissing  to look at
     Harry.
                                                HARRY
                     Joe -- I thought              it   was you.   Harry

                     Harry,      Harry,         how are you?
     Joe holds       out his      hand.          They shake.
                                                 HARRY

                Here's what I want.    I want a
                CAJ11pariand soda, but here's how I
                want it.   I want the CAJ11pari in a
                glass with ice, and the soda on the
                side, but in a bottle.    I don't
                want the soda in a glass,    I want to
                mix it myself.

     A wave is   in progress.  It sweeps around the stadium
     and passes by Harry and his friend,    JESS, sitting    in
     the second deck, surrounded   by Mets fans.    It's  fall,
     they're  both wearing jeans and windbreakers.
     Harry   is very    despondent.

                    institution,     like it's    nothing personal,
                    like it's    just something she's thinking
                    about in a kind of casual way.           I'm calm.
                    I say, why don't we think about it,

                    Next day she says she's thought about it,
                    she wants a trial     separation.       She just
                    wants to~        it, she says.      We can still
                    date, she says, like this is supposed to
                    cushion the blow.       I mean, I got married
                    so I could stop dating,        so I don't     see
                    where •we can still       date• is a big incentive
                    since as far as I'm concerned         the last
                    thing you want to do is date your wife,
                    who's supposed to love you, which is
                    what I'm saying to her when it crosses
                    my mind maybe she doesn't,         so I say,
                    ""Don't you love me anymore?"" and you
                    know what she says?        I don't know if

                             had kids, Alice,           and she would complain
                             about how she and Gary never did it
                             any more.        She didn't       even complain about

                            said it matter-of-factly.                  They were up
                            all night,        they were both exhausted             all
                            the time,the          kids just took
                            every sexual impulse they had out of them,
                            and Joe and I used to talk                  about it and
                            say, we're so lucky, we have this wonderful
                            relationship,          we can have sex on the kitchen
                            floor and not worry about the kid walking
                            in, we can fly off to Rome on a moment's
                            notice,     and then one day I was taking
                            Alice's     little       girl for the afternoon.           I'd
                            promised to take her to the circus,                    and we         •
                            were in a cab playing              ""I spy• -- you know,
                            I spy a lamppost,            I spy a mailbox -- and she               •
                            looked out the window and there was this
                            man and this woman with two little                   kids,
                            the man had one of the kids on his shoulders,
                            and Alice's        little     girl said,      ""I spy a
                            family,•      and I started         to cry.      You know,
                            I just started           crying,    and I went home,
                            and I said, the thing is, Joe, we never do
                            fly off to Rome on a moment's notice.

                         Not once.    It's this very cold
                         and hard Mexican ceramic tile.
                         Anyway, we talked about it for a long
                         time, and I said, this is what I want,

                         I guess it's     over and he left,    and the
                         truth is I feel really     fine.     I am
                         over him. I really      am over him. That
                         was it for him, that was the most he
                         could give, and every time I think about                    it,
                         I'm more and more convinced I did the

                                        we""re actually  able to enjoy going
                                        out with someone new.

                                        Yeah.

                                        And maybe even longer before we'll

                                        new.

     It's  Christmas    in New York.     Sally and Harry, bundled
     up against    the cold, a.re standing      at the Christmas
     tree stand on the corner,      trying    to figure  out which
     one to buy.      Sally finally   chooses one and pays for it.
     She and Harry pick it up together,            one holding the top
     and the other the bottom,  and start           to carry i.t to
     Sally's.   Together.

     funny hats and there's    one of those mi=ored    things
     hanging from the ceiling    and casting   twinkle  lights on
     a fairly  large crowd of revelers     in a large room some-
     where in Manhattan.
     A  band is playing.               Harry    and Sally   are   dancing.   Harry      •

     Sally   and her friend,    Marie,       walking      down the       street   on
     their   way to a restaurant.

                 Sixty dollars    I spent on this big
                 stupid  arrangement    of flowers,   and
                 I wrote a card that     I planned  to
                 leave out on the front table where
                 Arthur would just happen to see
                 it   --

                 He didn't    even come over.            He
                 forgot    some charity  thing          his wife
                 was chairman of.

                       personality,     that means she's not
                       attractive.      But just because I
                       happen to mention she has a good
                       personality,     she could be either.
                       She could be not attractive          with a
                       good personality,      or attractive     with
                       a good personality.

                   It's  not just that she always picks

                   I think restaurants    have become too

                   I agree.   ""Restaurants  are to
                   people in the Eighties   what theatre
                   was to people in the Sixties.""      I

                             They sing along, and they                     both get more and more idiotic.
                             Suddenly Harry turns pale                     and stops singing.
                             Sally    continues          on for      a moment and then                 notices      some-

                             I don""t see that,      Harry.    If
                             anyone's    a dog, you a.re the dog.
                             To you this is something that just
                             happened and you think you can say
•                            great,   it happened,    now let's  get
                             on with it, we'll      go back to the way
                             it was, like what happened didn't
                             mean anything     --
                They reach the screen,   but there's   no getting  behind it
                -- there are folded chairs and the bass player's        bass
                case and the drummer's drwn suitcases,     etc.   Sally
                reverses   and starts toward a door out of the room.
                Harry follows.

                             I'm not saying it didn't     mean

      The entire     wedding   party   is   assembled   around   the   band-
      stand.
      The band is PLAYING some kind of musical riff          that
      signals  that attention     must be paid.    Sally comes to a
      stop.   Harry is just behind her.       There's   a crowd of
      guests assembled    in a knot with Jess and Marie, their
      arms around each other,      standing there with their
      champagne glasses.      Jess is in front of the microphone.

           Marie takes         her wedding bouquet           and lobs   it   into   the
           air straight         at Sally.
           For a moment we think that Sally isn't going to make a move
           for it, she's just going to let it land on the floor.

           Sally,     in jeans and a plaid jacket,       has just bought her
           ~hristmas       tree, and the salesman has finished       putting
           plastic      netting  around  it.  Sally starts    to carry the tree.
           It's    very heavy, the top of it is dragging         slightly    behind
           her and she's leaving a little          trail  of pine needles behind
           her as she starts        home, but she's going to carry this damn
           tree home alone if it kills        her.
           As we watch her carry          the tree          home, we hear     a BEEP on
           Sally's machine.

    She turns        to go.
    She stops        dead in her tracks.
    It's    Harry.
    Slowly he comes towards                her,     and stops   in front     of her.
                                            HARRY
                     I've been doing a lot of thinking.
                     And the thing is, I love you.                                       •

                     this?
                                            HARRY
                     How about you love me, too?                                         •

    Sally    tu..s-ns and walks off,              parting   the crowd.
    Harry    follows         her like     a te=ier.
                                            HARRY
                     Doesn't what I said              mean anything
                     to you?
    During the following,        we hear the countdown to the New
    Year, after which eve:-yone breaks into ""Happy New
    Year•, confetti    flies,     eve:-yone is kissing   and breaking
    into Auld Lang Syne.
                                    SALLY
               What is it supposed to mean? I'm                                          •
               sor:-y, Harry.        I know it's  New Year's Eve
               and I know you're feeling         lonely,  but
               you can't      just show up here and tell me
               you love me and expect that to make it all
               right.     I mean, what am I supposed to say?
               Great, Harry, you love me, that settles           every-
               thing,    now we can waltz off into the sunset
               together?        It doesn't  work this way.

                  See, that's    just like you, Harry.
                  You say things     like that,  and you

   She starts      to cry.
   Harry   puts    his      arms around   her.
   They kiss.
   A long kiss.
   The twinkle       ball     goes around,       twinkling.
   They go on kissing.
   Auld Lang Syne continues             in the background.

                  them, we should remember them,
                  which is not possible     because we
                  forgot them --

                  Maybe you""re just supposed to

                  something -- anyway, it's  about                old
                  friends.

   And as the      camera     PULLS tJP away from them.

CENE 1
Cyndy
Happy Birthday dear , Happy Birthday to you! Did you make a
wish?
Tess
Yeah.
SCENE 2
Tess
No lunch. I got speech class.
Cyndy
What'dya need speech class for? You talk fine. All right. I'll
pick you up at 5:00 and we'll ride back together.
Tess
I can't. I've got an Emerging Market Seminar at 5:30.
Cyndy
Geez, it's your birthday! Can't they merge without you just this
once?
Tess
What time is my surprise party?
Cyndy
What?
Tess
C'mon.
Cyndy
Ah, I'm supposed to take you to drinks, have you home at 7:00.
Tess
Okay. I'll cut out early and be home at 7:15, okay?
Cyndy
All right.
Tess
Thank you very much.
SCENE 3
Woman
Hi Tess!
Tess
Good morning...Good morning....Mr. Turkel's line. Um, who's
calling, please? Hold on a moment. Mr. Lutz?
Mr. Lutz
No.
Tess
Um, hold on a second, all right?
SCENE 4
Tess
Mr. Turkel? Mr. Turkel?


                                Page 2/54

Mr. Turkel
Huh?
Tess
Um, Mr. Alagash...Hi....Uh, Mr. Alagash is on the phone and he's
real, real anxious to talk to you.
Mr. Turkel
You couldn't maybe get him to hold for a minute?!
Tess
Well, you got him in Dentitech, remember? The one I told you to
go short on? And it's fine, but he don't want to hear it from a
secretary.
Mr. Turkel
There's no paper!
Tess
What?
Mr. Turkel
There's no goddamned paper in this stall! Get me some?...Thanks.
You're very kind.
Tess
You're short on Dentitech at 18 and he'll be right here.
SCENE 5
Tess
See Dentitech closing at 17 and an 1/8? Come Monday I'll bet
it's 16 and still sittin' there.
Mr. Lutz
How do you figure?
Tess
Well, they went public at 23 with one product, plaque removing
mouthwash. You know, you rinse, you get this glob of plaque you
gotta spit out. I mean, maybe it'll be big, but I say that no
one ever got rich overestimating what the American public wants
to taste.
Mr. Lutz
Maybe.
Mr. Turkel
Uh, before I run Tess, I have some good news and some bad news.
The straight shot, Tessy, is...they turned you down for the Entre
Program again.
Tess
Why?
Mr. Lutz
We did all we could, Tessy.
Man
I mean, you have to remember, you're up against Harvard and


                                 Page 3/54

Wharton graduates. What do you got, some night school, some
secretarial time on your sheet?
Mr. Lutz
Christians and lions, Tess.
Man
That's right.
Tess
And the good news?
Man
Uh, Dave has a friend.
Mr. Lutz
Bob in Arbitrage. You're so hungry, they're looking for hungry
down there!
Tess
Really?
Mr. Lutz
Well, hungry is the name of the game down there! Bob's looking
for a new assistant and wants to meet you for a drink.
Tess
This isn't another set up?
Mr. Lutz
Do I look like a pimp? Bob says he's looking for hungry, I think
to myself, ""Tess."" The rest is up to you!
Tess
Bob in Arbitrage.
Mr. Lutz
Bob Speck. Extension 256. He's expecting your call. Go get 'em
Tessy!
Women
Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you!
Man
Oh no! You should have told us! Congratulations, Tessy!
Women

Tess
You know Mick, just once I could go for like a sweater or some
earrings, you know? A present that I can actually wear outside
of this apartment.
SCENE 8
Tess
So, is this where you usually meet for drinks?
Bob
Hmm, this is a big week! It's a super week! We are celebrating!
Tess
So, Arbitrage. Talk about adrenaline, huh? What do you think is
the most important quality for a great Arbitrager?
Bob
Well, we'll go through all that at the hotel.
Tess
The hotel?
Bob
Yeah, the company keeps a suite at the Ritz Carlton, and you
know, when it's empty, they give to us boys on a bonus basis--
Woah! We are gonna party!
Tess
Hey!
Bob
Oh, sorry! Allow me, I'm so sorry!
Tess
Hey Bob! Please!
Bob
Oh, sorry, sorry! I just get a little carried away. You know
what, Arbitrage has put out this sort of ""Introduction To"" tape
for the business schools. Why don't we put it in and if you have
any questions...
Tess
That would be great. Thanks.
Bob
Ha! Ha! Ha! It's the wrong tape! Uh, unless of course you
want to....
Tess
Bob, you're not seriously looking for a new assistant, are you?
Bob
Well, not exactly at this moment, but I'm always on the lookout
for new blood.
Tess
I'm hungry Bob, but I am not that hungry!
Bob


                                Page 5/54

Now, you see, I wouldn't put it that way.
Tess
I would! Um, would you just pull over right here please!
Bob
What are you doing?
Tess
Ha! Ha! Ha! Party Bob!
SCENE 9
Mr. Lutz
You're late Tess!
Tess

Types message:
dick.""
Mr. Lutz
Bitch!
Mr. Turkel
Take it easy!
SCENE 10
Ruth
Tess. Tess. Tess.
Tess
I know.
Ruth
You don't get ahead in this world by calling your boss a pimp.
Tess
Well, he is.
Ruth
Been lookin' at your file here. This is the third time in six
months I've had to place you.
Tess
Well, it wasn't my fault.
Ruth
Where have I heard that before?
Tess
Ruth, look it. I'm 30-years old. It took me five years of night
school but I got my degree and I got it with honors. I know I
could do a job. I mean, you ask any of my bosses--even, even
Lutz--if Tess McGill hasn't called a few.
Ruth
You ask them. I don't think they're gonna sing your praises,
Tess. Here's somethin' for you. Transferring down from Boston.
Mergers and Acquisitions. Name is Parker. Starts Monday. You
go home and cool off.


                                Page 6/54

Tess
Okay.
Ruth
Tess. This is the last time I can help you. Four strikes,
you're out.
SCENE 11
Tess
Tess McGill for Katherine Parker's office.
Woman
It's the last desk...at the end of the aisle.
Katherine
Hi. I'm Katherine Parker. You must be Tess.
Tess
Right.
Katherine
Oh, great bunny!
Tess
Um, I don't usually have a bunny on my desk. It was my birthday
a few days ago.
Katherine
No kidding? Mine's next Tuesday. How old?
Tess
30.
Katherine
Really? Well I'll be 30 next Tuesday. We're practically twins.
Tess
Except that I'm older.
Katherine
Just barely.
Tess
I've never worked for someone who is younger than me before. Or
for a woman.
Katherine
Well, there's a first time for everything. That's not going to
be a problem, is it Tess?
Tess
No.
Katherine
Good. Why don't you pour us a couple coffees and come on inside.
I'm light, no sugar.
SCENE 12
Katherine
The stock is at 38, the tender is at 56....Come in....Yeah, what
do we do about that? Well, I just checked my three. What are


                                Page 7/54

yours? Uh huh, yeah, I have that one. Well, I think he's in an
underwater position. All right, so that's our first and second
call and then we'll see where we are....Right. I'll count the
minutes. Bye....Thanks. So, Tess...a few ground rules. The way
I look at it, you are my link with the outside world. People's
impression of me starts with you. You're tough when it's
warranted, accommodating when you can be, you're accurate, you're
punctual, and you never make a promise you can't keep. I'm never
on another line, I'm in a meeting. I consider us a team Tess,
and as such we have a uniform: simple, elegant, impeccable.
""Dress shabbily, they notice the dress. Dress impeccably, they
notice the woman."" Coco Chanel.
Tess
Um, how do I look?
Katherine
You look terrific. You might want to rethink the jewelry....I
want your input Tess. I welcome your ideas and I like to see
hard work rewarded. It's a two-way street on my team. Am I
making myself clear?
Tess
Yes Katherine.
Katherine
And call me Katherine.
Tess
Okay.
Katherine
So, let's get to work, shall we? This department's profile last
year was damn pitiful. Our team has got its work cut out for
it....Okay, thanks.
SCENE 13
Woman
Damn! I forgot my pills again! Damn! It's the third time this
month! Jill, did you hear about that shot they got in Europe?
Jill
Yeah, they're giving it to women.
Woman
Yeah, to women! They're givin' it to in their arm and it's good
for 5 years! I tell you, these damn pills, I'm always forgettin'
em.
SCENE 14
Tess
I thought you might like this.
Woman
Why, thank you.


                                 Page 8/54

Katherine
Tess, would you come in here, please? And bring a notebook.
SCENE 15
Katherine
They already sold off both the paper and the printing divisions.
They sell distribution, too, we're talking real scorched
dirt....Come on in. Tess, this is Ginny. Ginny, Tess.
Tess
Hi.
Katherine
Being new in town, I thought I'd I throw a little cocktail thing
to introduce myself to the department, and Ginny here has some
great ideas. Would you jot them down?
Tess
Sure.
Ginny
The caterer is called ""Acme Eats."" You can get the number from
information. They do the usual hors d'oeuvres and such. The
""Raging Bull"" has a bartender service. And the liquor store on
Broadway and Liberty delivers. Got that, Bess?
Tess
Tess. Yeah, um, if that's the way you want to go.
Katherine
You have another idea?
Tess
Well, I was just reading a thing in ""W"" about dim sum, these
little Chinese dumplings. There's a restaurant on Mott St. that
does them for cocktail parties.
Katherine
Oh, I just love those little dumplings!
Tess
It might be more fun than the usual tidbits. I have it on my
desk. I could get it.
Ginny
You read ""W""?
Tess
I read a lot of things. I mean, you never know where the big
ideas could come from. You know?
Ginny
Well, I guess you're right. If dumplings can be considered a big
idea. Well, that oughta get you started...
Katherine
Ginny, thank you so much!
Ginny


                                Page 9/54

It's back to the gold mines!
Katherine
Right....You'll set those up?
Tess
Right away.
Katherine
Dim sum Tess, I like it...contribution-wise. Keep it up!
SCENE 16
Katherine
Then the chief says, ""We will respect your wish. We will give
you an honorable death. But first, keke.""
Tess
Excuse me. Excuse me. Dim sum?
Jim
So, come on Katherine. What do you say?
Katherine
Jim...the man who spends every weekend in August glued to his
desk--now that man knows that I can't just sneak out of my own
party. I'll tell you what, though. You get me in on the
Southeast Air divestiture plan, I'll buy you a drink. Bottle of
Crystal, two straws? Deal?
Jim
Okey-dokey!
Tess
Dim sum?
Jim
Hi.
Katherine
Thank you. What a slob.
Tess
You were so smooth with him. I probably would have...
Katherine
Never burn bridges. Today's junior prick, tomorrow's senior
partner! So, how do you think the party's going?
Tess
Pretty well, I think. Should I stop serving now?
Katherine
Hmm, better make one more round.
Tess
Right.
Katherine
I'd love to help you, but...we can't busy the quarterback with
passing out the Gatorade. Arnie, my hero! You've come!
SCENE 17


                                Page 10/54

Katherine
Yep?
Tess
Um, I have an idea, and you said I could come to you.
Katherine
Shoot.
Tess
Well, you know how Trask Industries has been looking to buy into
broadcasting?
Katherine
Something about the department is...
Tess
Working on it. Yeah. I've been following it myself, and all of
a sudden I thought, ""radio.""
Katherine
Trask is looking for television stations.
Tess
Well so is every Tom, Dick and Harry. See, my idea is that they
get their feet wet in radio and build from there. I mean, it's
not as glamorous as jumping right into TV, but it's a solid place
to start and there's a lot more of them for sale. Plus it would
solve Trask's problem with his Japanese competitors, trying to
take him over, because FCC forbids foreign ownership of radio as
well as TV.
Katherine
Interesting. You've been...following this, you say?
Tess
Yeah.
Katherine
No chance you overheard it, say, in the elevator?
Tess
No. No way.
Katherine
Somewhere?
Tess
It's my idea.
Katherine
Good. Good. Discuss it with anyone else?
Tess
Nope. You think that there's something there?
Katherine
Well, I can think it through for you. Why don't you leave me
your notes and I'll have a look-see.
Tess


                                 Page 11/54

Okay. Um, I've been trying to get into the Entre Program, and
this would be a big push. I mean if anything...anything happens,
you'll remember....
Katherine
Absolutely, Tess. Two-way street, remember?
Tess
Yeah. Thank you.
SCENE 18
Tess
It's just, it's so exciting! I mean, she takes me seriously.
And I think it's because, and I know you hate it when I say this,
but I think it's because she is a woman. There's none of that
chasing around the desk crap. And it's like, she wants to be my
mentor, which is exactly what I needed! I mean, I feel like I'm
finally gettin' somewhere, Mick.
Mick
Tess, that's great, but let's step on it or the pizza's gonna
freeze, Honey. Come on.
Tess
I mean, maybe we could all go out sometime. You know, dinner in
the city. You would like her, I think.
SCENE 19
Katherine
God, remember when all you had to do was a few buckles?
Tess
Yep, those were the days. I called the inn, and they said all
they can give you is a ground floor single in the new wing.
Katherine
Did you tell them it was me?
Tess
Well, I said Parker.
Katherine
Helmut? (Katherine speaks German to the owner of the inn)....It's
this tower room with a canopy bed and a fireplace big enough to
stand in. Perfect. Everything's in place.
Tess
For what?
Katherine
The man I've been seeing for a while. I think he's it. And I
think this could be the weekend we decide. He said that there
was something very important that he wanted to discuss with me.
I think he's going to pop the question.
Tess
You do?


                                 Page 12/54

Katherine
I think so. We're in the same city now. I've indicated that I'm
receptive to an offer. I've cleared the month of June. And I
am, after all, me.
Tess
Well, what if he doesn't pop the question?
Katherine
I really don't think that's a variable. Tess, you know, you
don't get anywhere in this world by waiting for what you want to
come to you. You make it happen. Watch me, Tess. Learn from
me. Oh, by the way, you know, I ran your Trask radio idea by
some of our people, it seems that Trask is dead set on
television. But hey, it wasn't out in left field, either. I
really liked the idea. You just keep plugging, bring me your
ideas, and we'll see what we can do.
Tess
Thank you Katherine.
Katherine
Tess? Tess! Look at me. Who makes it happen?
Tess
I do.
Katherine
Who does?
Tess
I do. I make it happen.
Katherine
That's right. Only then do we get what we deserve.
SCENE 20
(Katherine has a skiing accident)
SCENE 21
Tess
Ms. Parker's office. Hi Katherine. You what?
Katherine
Broke it skiing. And they won't be able to move me for at least
a couple of weeks. So this is what I need you to do....
Tess
Water plants, okay....Cable comes on Friday, right.
Katherine
Hey, easy with the leg, will you? Quit staring up my
gown!...Now, I'm staying at my parent's house and the housekeeper
is in Barbados for a month, wouldn't you know it. What a mess.
You need to let in the flower man and the cleaning lady. Sort
through the mail. The entrance code for the front door is...it's
754-3-2000. And um, I know there's more, but I can't think of


                                 Page 13/54

what. Go through the calendar on my desk. There's a bunch of
invitations to be RSVP'd....I know I'm asking an awful lot Tess,
but I don't know what else to do. I need you to take over.
Tess
Okay. Bye.
SCENE 22
Katherine

Recording:
the Alberts, um, 'Dear Eleanor and Gary, thank you so much for
the beautiful salt and pepper shakers. Not only are they the
perfect housewarming gift, but it was do dear of you to think of
me so far away....'"" ""Dear Sister, it's hard to believe, but
it's been 8 years since we said good-bye to Wesley. But of
course, we never really say good-bye. And on behalf of the

Tess

never really say good-bye. And on behalf of the Alumni Giving

SCENE 23
Mick
What, no class?
Tess


                                 Page 14/54

No class.
Mick
Tess. This is not what it looks like. I mean, it is what it
looks like, but I can explain. Well, not exactly explain....
Tess
You snake!
Mick
Come on, Tess! I'm sorry! I really am! I love you! Come on!
Come back and hit me! Please!
SCENE 24
Tess
Hello? Mr. Trainer's office, please...Hello, Tess McGill calling
from Petty, Marsh. May I put her through? Thank you....Mr.
Trainer? Hi, this Tess McGill. I work with Katherine Parker
over here in Mergers and Acquisitions. I have a proposal that I
would like to discuss with you. Not over the phone, though. Um,
I have an opening tomorrow morning at 10:00. Okay. I'll
messenger an outline over to you right now. Bye....Yes, I'm
calling for Katherine Parker...In regard to your invitation. Ms.
Parker is out of town, but Ms. Tess McGill will be attending in
her place. Yes, thank you. Good-bye.
SCENE 25
Cyndy
Why does it do that?
Tess
For cleaning.
Cyndy
Are you kidding me?
Tess
No.
SCENE 26
Cyndy
What is this thing you're going to, anyway?
Tess
It's a closing party for the Minidyne-Dalton merger. Dewey Stone
is throwing it, which is where this guy Trainer works. It's the
perfect time to meet him. Mix business with pleasure. Fringe
times are crucial.
Cyndy
Uh-huh. What did you do, snatch her invite?
Tess
Well, she can't use it. Besides, it's important for me to start
interacting with people, not as a secretary.
Cyndy


                                Page 15/54

But as a total impostor! Right.
Tess
This is it.
Cyndy
It needs some bows or something.
Tess
No. It's simple, elegant, yet makes a statement. Says to
people, confident, a risk taker, not afraid to be noticed. Then,
you hit 'em with your smarts! Here, shoes, I need shoes...
Cyndy
$6,000! It's not even leather!
Tess
$6,000? $6,000. Cyn, I can't breathe so good!
Cyndy
Oh God. Come here. Sit down. Let's see if she's got anything
soothing....Valium. In the convenient economy size.
Tess
You sure?
Cyndy
It just chills you ever so slightly. You won't even notice it.
SCENE 27
Cyndy
Are you sure about this?
Tess
You want to be taken seriously, you need serious hair.
SCENE 28
Man
Go for the jugular! Look, I've been telling you this for three
weeks! There are 19 million shares outstanding, we've got 25
percent. We get another 5 percent, we've got 'em by the throat!
Woman
Listen, Trainer, let's grab 'em by the balls!
Man
Leave our hearts at home!
Woman
Cut 'em off at the knees! They'll be eating out of our hands!
What do you say?
Jack
Is anybody thirsty?
Man
We need this one, Trainer! You need this one!
Jack
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SCENE 29


                                Page 16/54

Jack
I've been looking for you.
Tess
Why? Do you know me?
Jack
No. No. But I promised myself that when I saw you, I would get
to know you. You're the first woman I've seen at one of these
damn things that dresses like a woman, not like a woman thinks a
man would dress if he was a woman.
Tess
Thank you, I guess.
Jack
What are you doing here?
Tess
Actually, I'm looking for someone myself. His name is Jack
Trainer. He works at Dewey, Stone. Do you know if he's here?
Jack
Why are you looking for him?
Tess
Well, because I have a meeting with him tomorrow and I thought it
might be nice to say hello and get a head start.
Jack
Well, he uh, just left.
Tess
Oh. Well, I should be going myself.
Jack
Well, have a drink with me.
Tess
I can't...What's your name?
Jack
No. No names. No business cards. No ""You must know so and so.""
Tess
What is this?
Jack
No resumés. Let's just meet like human beings...for once.
Tess
Well, it's nice to meet you, whatever your name is, but I really
do have to go.
Jack
Please? Please. One drink.
Tess
Okay, one drink. But I'm buying.
Jack
Okay, but it's an open bar.


                                 Page 17/54

Tess
Right. I knew that. I meant that if it wasn't, I'd be buying.
Jack
Yeah. Tequila gold....Doubles.
Tess
Tequila?
Jack
Yeah. I promised myself that when we met, we'd drink tequila.
No Chardonay, no frog water--real drinks....These things are
usually so boring.
Tess
I wouldn't know.
Jack
Power to the people.
Tess
The little people....Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
Jack
You okay?
Tess
Mmm, I'm fine. I'm just fine. I took a, um, antihistamine
before, and it makes for a nice little buzz!
Jack
Oh. I didn't know that they let bad girls into these things.
Tess
Do I look like I don't belong here?
Jack
No. No. I'm sure that you're a real ace at whatever it is you do
do.
Tess
Damn straight.
Jack
But how you look....
Tess
I have a head for business and a bod for sin. Is there anything
wrong with that?
Jack
No. No.
Mr. Turkel
Hello! Hi!
Tess
And I have to go now!
Jack
Well, I'll come with you.
Tess


                                Page 18/54

No.
Mr. Turkel
Hey, don't go! Hey Tess!
Tess
I need some air. Meet me outside. Thank you.
SCENE 30
Jack
Excuse me, please....Hello? Hi.
Driver
Hi.
Jack
Hello...Where do you live?
Tess
Hmmm, park, trees...tall building.
Jack
166 Morton. Near Hudson.
Driver
166 Morton.
SCENE 31
Jack
Might be kind of a mess. The cleaning lady keeps changing days
on me. Anybody's guess. I'm just warning you 'cause...if it's
the day before, it could be pretty bad....I don't notice it so
much myself, but some of the people I've had over have...you
know...remarked on it....It's not so bad....Would you...Would you
like, uh, a nightcap?....I guess not. Uh, I guess it's too late
for coffee. Herb tea? No...I don't have any...but it always
sounds good when people offer it to me when I'm in your shape. I
might have a little brandy myself....Boy, you sure are pretty.
SCENE 32
Tess
Don't fuck up. Don't fuck up. Don't fuck up....Hi, Tess McGill
to see Jack Trainer.
Woman
May I take your coat?
Tess
Yes, please.
Woman
Gentlemen? Tess McGill.
Jack
Miss McGill. I'm Jack Trainer. How are you? This is, uh, John
Romano and Bernie Kotar. Come in.
Mr. Kotar
Hello.


                                 Page 19/54

Jack
Sit down, please....Coffee?
Tess
Sure.
Woman
Milk or sugar?
Tess
Um, yes, both, thank you....Well, I suppose we should just get
right down to it. Is that okay?
Jack
Sure, please.
Tess
I've lost my briefcase....In each of the last three quarters,
Trask Industries has announced plans to acquire a major market
television station, each time unsuccessfully. At the same time,
they've expended time and money fighting off a hostile takeover
attempt by one of their Japanese competitors. Buying into radio
would, in one fell swoop, accomplish two important tasks. It
would give Trask a solid base in broadcasting, and because of FCC
regulations forbidding foreign ownership of radio stations, it
would wipe out the threat of a Japanese takeover.
Mr. Romano
Interesting idea. But I don't like it. Trask has a lot of cash
on their balance sheet. That's one of the big reasons they're a
takeover target. And a radio station is small potatoes. I can't
see him biting.
Tess
Well, I've already thought of that. I figured that we'd look for
a radio network, one with a real high profile. And with the
surplus cash, we implement a major stock repurchase. So Trask is
protected and their stock goes up, and everybody's happy...or
not.
SCENE 33
Tess
Oh, shoot me, just shoot me!
Cyndy
Would you cut that out? They didn't throw you out, did they?
Tess
Oh! Well, they don't exactly have bouncers, you know. They're a
little more subtle than that, Cyn...Oh God, and last night!
Cyndy
Yeah. I should've checked the milligrams. Live and learn.
Well, you know, maybe he'll feel sorry for you, and make it up to
you doing your deal or whatever it is.


                                 Page 20/54

Tess
I'm not looking for sympathy. You know, I had a shot at it...you
know!
SCENE 34
Tess
It's him. He's here!
Cyndy
Him? Where?
Tess
Uh, do me a favor, do me a favor. Be me. Be my secretary!
Cyndy
Tess!
Tess
Cyn, please! Do it for me? Okay!
Cyndy
Tess!
SCENE 35
Jack
Hi.
Cyndy
May I help you?
Jack
Jack Trainer to see Miss McGill.
Cyndy
Let's give her a shout, shall we?....You decent?....A Mr. Jack
Trainer to see you, Miss McGill.
Tess
Thank you, Cynthia.
Cyndy
Hold all calls, Miss McGill?
Tess
Yes, Cynthia. Thank you.
Cyndy
Can I get you anything, Mr. Trainer? Coffee, tea, me?
Tess
Isn't she a riot! That'll be all, Cynthia....Why did you say you
weren't you last night?
Jack
Because I knew what would happen. All Mergers and Acquisitions.
No lust and tequila.
Tess
That was...I mean, that just happened, okay? I want to make it
clear, um....
Jack


                                Page 21/54

Yes?
Tess
What did happen, exactly?
Jack
The earth moved. The angels wept....The polaroids are uh, uh,
are in my other coat....Nothing happened. Nothing happened.
Tess
I woke up in my underwear.
Jack
I'll bet you looked nice.
Tess
Did you get me that way?
Jack
I, uh, I took off your shoes. I took off your dress. I put you
on the bed, and I kept my eyes closed the whole time.
Tess
And that was it?
Jack
I might have peeked. I don't remember. Look, I don't have all
day to hang out here and discuss your sex life. Here.
Tess
What's this?
Jack
Open it.
Tess
What's this for?
Jack
I thought you could use a better briefcase if we're gonna put
this deal together.
Tess
You liked it?
Jack
It has possibilities....I want to go first to Metro Radio
Systems. They're a solid, family-owned, mid-sized network in the
South. They had offers before and rejected them. But the
father's about to retire, and the son's just been forced out by
his board of directors. A lot of squabbling--a good time to go
in.
Tess
Okay.
Jack
There's just one thing we don't get, though. Why didn't you just
put it together with your people here? Why'd you come to us?
Tess


                                Page 22/54

Will you excuse me for one second?
Jack
Sure.
SCENE 36
Ginny
You're not helping me! No! Bess, my computer's down and I'm
right in the middle of something. I need Katherine's office
right away!
Tess
Sure, of course, no problem. I'll be with you in five minutes.
Ginny
I need it five minutes ago!
Tess
I'll be right with you.
Ginny
What's going on in there?
Cyndy
She's dusting.
SCENE 37
Tess
Jack, listen. My 1:00 is getting a little antsy, so, can I walk
you to the elevator?
Jack
Yeah, sure. But first answer my question.
Tess
Right. Um...I came to you because...I wanted an ace on this.
The best.
Jack
Mm-hm. Good thinking. Well, I'll fly down to Memphis in the
morning and feel them out.
Tess
Absolutely. Fine.
SCENE 38
Cyndy
Look, everyone wants a part of the McGill mind. I'm afraid
you'll just have to wait.
Tess
Ginny, go right in. I'll be with you in just a minute.
Cyndy
I don't know how much longer I can handle this. Uh, she's backed
up.
Ginny
What are you talking about?
Cyndy


                                Page 23/54

Can I get you anything? Coffee, tea?
SCENE 39
Jack
Are you free for dinner tonight?
Tess
No. Sorry.
Jack
Okay. How about tomorrow? I'll be back around 8:00.
Tess
I can't.
Jack
When, then?
Tess
I don't think that we should get involved that way.
Jack
Well, what are you talking about? What about last night?
Tess
Look, I'm not that girl. Last night was...special.
Jack
It wasn't so special! I had to carry you up three flights of
stairs.
Tess
I meant unusual special. Look, we're in a business deal together
now, and I just don't think that we should get involved that way.
My life is real complicated as it is.
Jack
I don't want to complicate it either. I just thought dinner,
maybe a movie.
Tess
We both know what we're talking about.
Jack
I certainly hope so!
Tess
You know, maybe I just don't like you.
Jack
Me? Nah!
SCENE 40
Mick
Are you sure she's gonna show?
Cyndy
It's my engagement party. She knows she's dead meat if she
doesn't.
Man
Hi, Tess.


                                 Page 24/54

Tess
I'm real sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.
Cyndy
You're gonna be out of work, you keep scamming like you are!
Look, I'm nervous as hell, and I think Mick's about to drown
himself in a Scotch bottle.
Tess
He's bad, huh?
Cyndy
Throw him a bone, will you? I want happy humans here tonight.
SCENE 41
Mick
Tess.
Tess
Snake.
Mick
You look different.
Tess
Yeah, well, I'm not the same pathetic trusting fool that I was a
couple of days ago. It shows, huh?
Bartender
Hey, Tess! How you doin'? What are you havin'?
Tess
Stow this behind the bar for me, will you Tony? And, um, I'll
have a Chivas, and buy Mick one of whatever.
Bartender
You got it.
Mick
No, I just mean the hair, the duds, and the briefcase. What's
goin' on?
Tess
Make fun if you want.
Mick
No, no. You look good. Classy. What, did you have to go to
traffic court or somethin'?
Tess
No, I just got off work. I sort of got a promotion.
Mick
Well, to Cyn and Tim...to you and me...to you and your
promotion...to me getting a boat loan....
Tess
You what?! You did?!
Mick
My loan was approved just this morning.


                                 Page 25/54

Tess
Oh, that is...
Mick
Put a down payment on Jimmy Noonan's old boat.
Tess
...so great
SCENE 42
Tim
""Hours of fun for the entire family. Love, Tess and Mick.""
Thank you.
Mick
I put from both of us. I didn't know if you'd gotten somethin'
or what....Okay, toast! We need a toast!....Thank you. Thank
you....Okay, from me and Tess and everybody here...may your life
together be long and happy, and may the road always rise up to
meet you.
Tim
Hey, when are we gonna toast the two of you, Mick?
Friends
Yeah!
Mick
Shhh!
Friends
Yeah!
Mick
Well, we haven't, uh, really discussed it. I mean, not recently.
Tess
No.
Tim
You don't discuss it, boy, you just ask.
Friends
Yeah! That's right!
Mick
Here?
Friends
Yeah, here!
Mick
Now?
Friends
Now! Yeah!
Tim
On your knees, Mick! Come on!
Friends
Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick...!


                                Page 26/54

Mick
Tess, will you marry me?
Tess
Maybe.
Mick
That's an answer?
Tess
You want another answer, ask another girl.
SCENE 43
Mick
You fucking humiliated us in there!
Tess
Well, you set us up, Mick, doing it like that! What did you
expect me to do? Lie if front of all those people? Just
automatically say yes?
Mick
Didn't know you'd have to lie! I thought maybe you would want me
to ask.
Tess
Three nights ago, I find you in bed with Doreen. We barely have
a drink and a dance and then, boom! You want an answer about the
rest of my life!
Mick
All right, okay. Here we are, just the two of us. Will you
marry me, or what?!
Tess
Jesus, Mick! Do we have to decide this right now?
Mick
I want to get things solidified. Things in my life! You're not
the only one with plans, you know!
Tess
I said, maybe.
Mick
Maybe means dick! Fuck maybe! I want an answer now!
Tess
Please don't yell at me! You treat me like I'm dumb.
Mick
Why are we always talkin' about the way you get treated, huh?
Who the fuck died and made you Grace Kelly?!
Tess
I am not steak! You can't just order me!
Mick
Look, I don't need this! You get your priorities straight, maybe
we'll talk. Right now, we're history.


                                Page 27/54

SCENE 44
Tess
Katherine Parker's office. Um, I'll switch you over.
Cyndy
Tess? It's me....I couldn't find the red shoes, but...
Tess
Shh! Tess McGill's office. Who's calling? One moment,
please....Jack.
Jack
It went well in Memphis. Yeah. Really well, I think. But we're
gonna have to move fast and hit 'em high. Armbrister thinks that
Metro is, uh...family, and you know how that can be. He's
willing to listen, but, uh...you gotta get Trask to talk sweet.
He's thinkin' about 70 mil....I've been up here all night,
workin' the numbers. I'd like to go over it with you. Can we
meet for lunch? I mean, lunch is all right, isn't it? Daylight,
a lot of people around. Is that real romantic? The souvlaki
stand out in front of your place. You're in no particular
danger, I think....Yeah. Meet you there around one.
Tess
Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.
Cyndy
Mick's really raw. He says he's gonna throw the rest of your
stuff out. He kept me there talkin' until 5:00 this morning.
Tess
Oh, God, Cyn...I'm sorry....How hard would it be to crash a
wedding?
Cyndy
What are you talkin' about?
Tess
Oren Trask's daughter is getting married tomorrow and there's a
reception following at the Union Club. So, I figured I'd blend
in...I get to Trask. I mean, how hard could that be? I also
figure that the wedding party's not gonna admit that they've
never seen you before. I mean, nobody knows everybody at those
things, right?
Cyndy
Tess, wait a minute.
Tess
And all I need is just 5 minutes with Trask.
Cyndy
Tess, I'm talking to you.
Tess
What?


                                Page 28/54

Cyndy
First of all, look me in the eye and tell me you're not thinkin',
even in your wildest dreams, Mister Briefcase-let's-have-lunch
there is gonna take you away from all of this.
Tess
We're doing a business deal together, that's all.
Cyndy
'Cause you know goin' in you're gonna get your heart stomped!
Just like you're stompin' Micks!
Tess
Hey, it wasn't me poppin' Doreen DiMucci in our bed, okay? How
come you're all on his side?
Cyndy
I'm not. But you're not even givin' him the slightest chance to
make it up to you, and that's not like you. Look, all I'm saying
is, if you're so smart, why don't you act smart and save your ass
while you still can. Else they're gonna find out, you're not
gonna have your job, or any job. You're outta of your man and
your home already!
Tess
I'm gonna come clean as soon as I get my end set up. I swear. I
know what I'm doing.
Cyndy
Yeah, so do I. Screwin' up your life!
Tess
No, I'm trying to make it better! I'm not gonna spend the rest
of my life working my ass off and getting nowhere just because I
followed rules that I had nothing to do with setting up,
okay?!....Tess McGill's office.
Katherine
Hello, Tess. It's your office?
Tess
Katherine! No! Of course it's still your office. I don't know.
I was just....
Cyndy
I'll see you, Tess.
Tess
Cyn?
Cyndy
Sometimes I sing and dance around the house in my underwear. It
doesn't make me Madonna. Never will.
Katherine
Um...are you there?
Tess


                                 Page 29/54

Yes, Katherine.
SCENE 45
Katherine
Don't get too used to those long lunches, Tess. They're letting
me go a week from today.
Tess
A week from today? Isn't that a little faster than you thought?
Katherine
Well, the doctor says I've got great bones. Of course, his
aren't too bad either!....Anyway, I need you to summarize the
Baron Oil prospectus...
Skier
Hello, Miss Katherine.
Katherine
Hi, Schatz! ...and uh, send that along to me along with the last
two quarterly reports. You are a sport.
Tess
Yes, I'm a sport.
Katherine
Thank you, Tess, so much. I'll talk to you again soon.
Tess
Okay. Bye.
SCENE 46
Jack
So what kind of figures have you been throwing out?
Tess
Well, no exact figures yet.
Jack
Well, what's their ballpark?
Tess
Well, I wanted to get them excited about the concept before I
start throwing actual figures at them.
Jack
Well, are they excited?
Tess
They're going to be.
Jack
Well, wait a minute. I've been working on this thing for 36
hours straight, trying to put this thing together. I got a
progress meeting with my...the head of my department at 2:00.
Now where the hell exactly are we?!
Tess
Don't yell at me!
Jack


                                Page 30/54

Hey. Answer me!
Tess
Well, I uh, as a matter of fact, am gonna see Trask himself
tomorrow. I feel that we're strong enough to go right to him.
Jack
Oh. All right. Where are we meeting him? What time?
Tess
He's not expecting both of us.
Jack
Are you trying to fly this thing without me?!
Tess
No! I wouldn't do that.
Jack
You go and set up this meeting without me. What does...what does
that say? What the hell kind of way to do business is this?!
Tess
Would you calm down?
Jack
How am I supposed to calm down? One lost deal is all it takes to
get canned there days. Look, the line buttons on my phone all
have an inch of little pieces of tape piled on. The names of new
guys over the names of old guys, good men who aren't at the other
end of their line anymore, all 'cause of one lost deal. I don't
want to get buried under a little piece of tape.
Tess
No one's trying to bury you under a little piece of tape.
Jack
Okay, so I've been in a little bit of a slump. I'm not afraid to
admit it. There it is. Look, give me a break here. Don't go
leading me on. If you've got some doubts about me, say 'em to my
face. Give me that much.
Tess
I don't have any doubts about you.
Jack
Okay. You need me...you know.
Tess
I mean, any doubts about your ability.
Jack
You need me at that meeting.
SCENE 47
Jack
Is he jet-lagged from somewhere, or he just lunches late?
Tess
Huh?


                                 Page 31/54

Jack

3:
Tess
Well, it's not exactly lunch, but there will be food there,
though.
Jack
What's the story, Tess?
Tess
It's his daughter's wedding.
Jack
That's the meeting?
Tess
Well, it's the perfect opportunity. He's happy, he's had a
little champagne, we look for an opening. Trust me.
Jack
What are we supposed to do, jump out of the wedding cake?
Tess
Don't be silly.
SCENE 48
Guard #1
Come in, man. Come in. Welcome. Come in.
Guard #2
Welcome to our party. Come in.
Hostess
Hello! Nice to see you. Do you know which table you're at?
Jack
Uh, no.
Tess
Oh, I see Phyllis. Come on.
SCENE 49
Trask
Glad you could make it. Oren and Barbara Trask.
Tess
Tess McGill. What a great idea.
Jack
Jack Trainer.
Tess
It's so nice to see you again.
Trask
Hi.
Jack
Hello.
Trask


                                Page 32/54

Well, the kids thought it would, uh, be fun.
Jack
Oh, it's beautiful.
Barbara
You must be friends of Mark's.
Tess
Right.
Trask
Well, let's get you over there.
Tess
Actually, I really should go powder my bathroom...nose. Um,
darling, will you wait here?
Jack
Oh, sure.
Tess
Us, so nice...See you later.
Jack
I think I'll get a drink.
Trask
Oh, Bunny!
SCENE 50
Tess
Get a grip, get a grip, Tess. Get a grip.
Jack
We're not even invited to this thing, are we?
Tess
Okay, so we were not exactly invited. But he's here, and we're
here, so that make us...
Jack
Total idiots!
Tess
...in the right place at the right time.
Jack
You're like one of those crazed cops, aren't you? The kind
nobody wants to ride with! Whose partners all end up dead or
crazy.
Tess
Just act like you belong.
Phyllis
Oh. Do you love it, or do you hate it?
Tess
Love it.
Phyllis
So do I! But Mark says it looks like Nicaragua and that we're


                                Page 33/54

making some kind of statement.
Tess
Oh no! It, it's just like paradise. It's like a paradise with
little gold palm trees.
Phyllis
Thank you.
Tess
You're welcome.
Phyllis
I hope I'm not being rude, but...who are you?
Tess
I'm Tess. I'm a friend of Mark's. I'm just so happy that I
could...be here for you...today.
Jack
Glorious! Fabulous! Stunning, really. Super! Elegant!
Perfect!
SCENE 51
Tess
You're right. This is crazy, so let's just go.
Jack
Excuse me. The woman that's dancing with Oren, what's her name?
Bridesmaid
Oh...oh, Elizabeth Stubblefield.
Jack
That's right! Uh, Liz? Beth?
Bridesmaid
Bitsy.
Jack
Bitsy! That's right.
Tess
Jack?
Jack
You wanna do it...do it.
SCENE 52
Jack
Excuse us. Bitsy, don't break my heart and tell me you don't
remember me.
Bitsy
Of course I do!
Jack
Excuse us.
Tess
Talk about a small world, huh?....I mean, here we've just met and
yet I feel as though I've spent so much time working with you.


                                 Page 34/54

Trask
Hmm?
Tess
In a way. I'm in Mergers and Acquisitions at Petty, Marsh.
Trask
Oh..well, I really wish you were having more luck with your team.
Tess
Well, so do I. So do I. I've been trying to set you up with a
radio network, but my bosses, they think that you're just stuck
on acquiring television and won't even listen.
Trask
Well, that's not true.
Tess
Well, that's what I said. I said that the man who in 1971 looked
into the future and saw that it was named microwave technology,
the man who applied Japanese management principles while the
others were still kowtowing to the unions...
Trask
Mm-hm.
Tess
...the man who saw the Ma Bell break-up coming from miles
away...I mean, this man did not get to be this man, you, I mean,
by shutting himself off to new ideas. Am I right, or am I right?
Trask
Well, I think you're right.
Tess
You're damn straight I'm right!
Trask
If you've got the right property, I'd love to hear about it.
Tess
You would?
Trask
Well, absolutely!
Hostess
There she is.
Trask
Well, what...wha?
Hostess
There she is, darling.
Tess
Umm..um, you know, I really, I just realized that I...I'm hogging
the father of the bride, and I see Phyllis coming in. Well, what
do you say I give you a call on Monday?
Trask


                                 Page 35/54

Well, our media consultant is Tim Draper.
Tess
Tim, right.
Jack
Honey, I'm starved.
Tess
So am I. Bye.
Trask
Bye.
Jack
Bye.
SCENE 53
Tess
Go ahead and laugh. He wants us to meet with his people first
thing Monday, so....
Jack
Oren Trask? The man who said, ""What if we sliced the bread
before we sold it?""
Tess
Yeah, all right.
Jack
No, no, no, I loved it! I had fun. And you were amazing.
Tess
You think so?
Jack
Amazing.
SCENE 54
Jack
The, uh, the Fort Worth station...projected revenue should read
up 8 percent, not 6. And where it says, uh...the FCC ruling on,
um...Metro's Memphis transmitter is pending, that's outdated.
FCC approved it Friday. Doubles the signal reach...ups the
station's value by 30 percent....And now back to our regularly
scheduled programming.
Tess
I guess we're ready.
SCENE 55
Jack
Trainer and McGill.
Woman
Yes. Top of the stairs.
Jack
Thank you.
SCENE 56


                                Page 36/54

Tess
Are we waiting for Mr. Trask?
Draper
Mr. Trask doesn't sit in at this level.
Tess
Of course he doesn't. Here's the way we see it. Trask
Industries has two important needs to meet at this point in time.
Jack
By acquiring Metro Radio Network, you nail two birds with one
stone, except the proposal...
Draper
Excuse me, do you, do you have any other proposals besides Metro?
Tess
No. Why?
Jack
Metro's a terrific opportunity.
Draper
Well, I'm sure it is, but a Chicago group just put a bear hug on
Metro this morning, and the company's in play.
Tess
Just this morning?
Jack
Who?
Draper
The Slade brothers. Trask isn't aiming at radio anyway. We
certainly don't want to get into a bidding war.
Tess
A moment, please...Armbrister looks at Metro as if it were part
of his family. He cares who he's selling to.
Jack
Yes. And he holds the majority of the stock. Look, if the
Slades are uninvited, and I'm sure they are...and Armbrister and
Trask can agree on a deal, then we won't have a war. If I can
get Armbrister up here, will Trask take the meeting?
Draper
A lot of ifs. We really don't want to get involved.
Tess
Twenty-four hours.
Draper
Sorry. Not interested. (Telephone rings)...Yes, sir? All
right, sir...Yes, he'll take the meeting.
Tess
That was Mr. Trask?
Draper


                                 Page 37/54

Yes, it was.
Tess
How did he know?
Draper
He knows everything.
Tess
Hmm.
SCENE 57
Jack
Thanks a lot.
Delivery Boy
Thanks.
Tess
How did you get this scar?
Jack
Some guy pulled a knife in Detroit.
Tess
Really?
Jack
No. No. I was nineteen and I thought it would be cool to have a
pierced ear. My girlfriend stuck the needle through and I heard
this pop and fainted and hit my chin on the toilet.
Tess
Have you been telling that story ever since?
Jack
You're the only one who knows the true story.
Tess
Except the girlfriend.
Jack
I had her, uh...disappear. It's too bad. Nice girl. Real
shame.
Tess
Jack?
Jack
Hmm?
Tess
There's something that I have to tell you.
*Telephone rings.
Jack
Hello...Hi...I know. No, uh...can't wait. Uh...uh, oh yeah,
okay. Well, call me when you get in. Okay. Uh...m-me too.
Okay, 'bye. 'Bye....Okay. There's this woman. It's over. But
technically it's not. I just haven't got a chance to break if
off yet.


                               Page 38/54

Tess
It's okay. You don't have to explain.
Jack
No, really. Look, we were supposed to go away...together a
couple of weeks ago and I was gonna tell her then. But I had to
work straight through the weekend and I never got there. It's
just a...a timing thing....It's just, she broke her leg skiing
and was laid up and I couldn't see doing it over the phone. You
know...kicking somebody when they're down. I wouldn't have
mentioned it, except...she's in your department at Petty. You
mentioned her the first time you called.
Tess
Uh...Katherine?
Jack
Parker, yeah....Now what did you wanna tell me? Huh?
Tess
Oh, it's not important.
SCENE 58
Clerk
One hundred twenty, even.
Tess
Twenty...thirty...forty...there. Okay.
Clerk
Oh, Miss! Miss! You forgot your book.
Tess
Thank you very much.
SCENE 59
Katherine
Oh...Tess! It's me! I'm back! Thanks! Oh! Oh God!
Attendant
She took a muscle relaxant for the flight down.
Katherine
Oh, let's all have one, shall we?
Attendant
I don't think so.
Katherine
Oh, telephone! I need a telephone! Oh, Tess, take care of the
bags. I'll meet you at the car. ""Oh, Tannebaum! Oh,
Tannebaum!"" Oh, I love these pills. Are there any more? (On

telephone):
darling. My apartment in one hour, and I won't take no for an
answer. No, I won't take no for an answer.
SCENE 60


                                Page 39/54

Katherine
Oh, I'm home! I'm home! I'm home! Oh!...Oh...God! Did you
happen to see this?
Tess
What is it?
Katherine
It's an outline of your idea for a Trask radio acquisition.
Tess
Oh?
Katherine
I was planning to send it over to Jack Trainer to have a look. I
thought I'd give your idea one last go-around. It just occurs to
me, looking at it, that it reads as though it were my idea. You
see, Jack got burned once. He was accused of stealing a plan for
taking a company private. He's very sticky about the ethics of
reviewing other people's formative strategies. He wouldn't have
looked at it if I'd said it was from a colleague and I couldn't
very well say it was a secretary's notion. Anyway, the point is,
Tess, that I'm still trying to get you heard.
Tess
Oh.
Katherine
What am I saying? If you had seen it, you simply would have
asked me about it. Trust....I'll need help bathing and changing.
SCENE 61
Katherine""Oh, I need something to cover this cast. There's an
Afghan on the chair....Perfect.
Tess
If that'll be all....
Katherine
Oh, and some perfume. Uh, Shalimar...on the dresser...He loves
Shalimar.
Tess
He, who?
Katherine
Jack Trainer, who. He's on his way over.
Tess
I have to go. Doctor's appointment.
Katherine
Oh, one last thing? Run down to the drugstore and get me my
pills?
Tess
I really have to go.
Katherine


                                Page 40/54

The doctor will understand. Thanks.
SCENE 62
Jack
Uh, keep the change.
SCENE 63
Katherine
Who is it?
Jack
It's Jack.
SCENE 64
Jack
Katherine?
Katherine
In the bedroom....Jack!
Jack
Katherine. Oh....
Katherine
Boy, did I ever miss you!
Jack
Does it hurt?
Katherine
Look at you.
Jack
You said it was urgent, Kath.
Katherine
I'd forgotten how damn handsome you are.
Jack
Oh...thanks. Look, uh...I meant what I said. I really am
swamped and I...
Katherine
Boy, some welcome home. I haven't even gotten a kiss....Um,
there's some champagne in the little fridge. You wanna get it
for us?
Jack
Sure. And then...then I really do have to go....Where are the
glasses?
Katherine
Try the dishwasher.
Jack
Here you are.
Katherine
Mmm....You know I love you, Jack....You know that.
Jack
Katherine, I really do have to get going.


                                Page 41/54

Katherine
These past few weeks, I've heard this funny little sound way deep
down inside. Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock. My
biological clock.
Jack
Big deal going. Principals are all meeting at two...
Katherine
And I've been thinking. Let's merge. You and I. Think of it,
darling. Mr. and Mrs. Fabulously Happy.
Jack
Katherine, it's really not a good time to talk.
Katherine
You're right. Can Big Jack come out to play?
Jack
Kath! Little Jack really has to get going.
Katherine
Little Katie's been so lonely.
Jack
No! No! No!
Katherine
Jack! What is it?
Jack
Kath, there's something I have to tell you. There's...There's
someone else and I...
Katherine
There's someone else?
Jack
Some else that I have to be meeting with right now. Big deal
going. Can't be in two places at the same time. Talk to you
later. 'Bye.
SCENE 65
Tess
Here we are. Okay, I've got to run. Sorry, 'bye.
Katherine
Tess, you forgot your n...notebook....That...little....slut!
That...goddamn little bitch...secretary!
SCENE 66
Tess
Hi. I'm meeting...Uh, I have a meeting with Mr. Trask.
Guard
Yes, your name, please?
Tess
Tess McGill.
Guard


                                 Page 42/54

All right, it's at the top of the stairs.
Tess
Thank you.
SCENE 67
Receptionist
Miss...McGill?
Tess
Yes.
Receptionist
Good afternoon. Let me take your coat.
Tess
Thank you.
Receptionist
This way, please.
Tess
Thank you.
SCENE 68
Jack
Hi.
Tess
Hi. Is everything okay?
Jack
Yeah, yeah. You're the only one from Petty here so far. What's
going on?
Tess
Flying solo on this.
Jack
Good. Old Armbrister and Trask are over there in the corner.
We're all waiting to see what color smoke comes out of the
chimney.
Tess
Tell me something. If a colleague of mine had a strategy that
they needed help with, would you look at it if I asked you to?
Jack
Yeah, sure.
Tess
No ethics problem? You know, open to accusations about stealing?
Jack
I look at stuff all the time. Nobody's ever accused me of
stealing.
Tess
Uh-huh.
Jack
What's it about?


                                Page 43/54

Tess
Um...I don't know. I'm so nervous, I can't stand still.
Jack
You'll be fine...I love you.
Tess
I love you, too.
SCENE 69
Businessman
Gentlemen?
Trask
There was a story on the news last night showing life imitating
an old children's riddle. It seems that a truck got stuck at the
entrance to the Holland Tunnel. Too high for the clearance.
Well, for hours, the experts tried to find some way to unwedge
the vehicle, but to no avail. Finally, a ten-year-old girl in a
passing car suggested simply letting the air out of the truck's
tires, thus lowering it to the clearance level, which they did.
And it worked. Well, by letting some of the air out of our
strategy to expand into broadcasting, Miss McGill and Mr. Trainer
have effectively shown all of us here at Trask the light at the
end of our tunnel.
Armbrister
Oh, gentlemen, uhh, and ladies, I've decided to sell Mr. Trask
the Metro Radio System for sixty-eight point five million dollars
in cash and securities. Now, of course, this is, uh, an
agreement in principle. As to what constitutes principles in
this day and age, I'm gonna leave that up to you barracudas to
squabble over.
SCENE 70
Katherine
I'm certain they'll want to hear this!
Receptionist
Miss, this is a closed meeting and you can't...!
Katherine
Thank God I'm here!
Trask
What the hell is going on?
Katherine
You're being tricked! That's what's going on.
Jack
Katherine! What are you...?
Katherine
Jack, just trust me and sit down! My name is Katherine Parker and
I'm an associate partner in Mergers and Acquisitions at Petty,


                                 Page 44/54

Marsh. And this woman is my secretary!
Jack
She is not!
Katherine
Oh, no?! Ask her.
Jack
You're not her secretary!
Tess
I can explain, Jack.
Jack
Oh, Jesus. You are her secretary.
Katherine
While I was laid up with broken bones, she rifled through my
desk, found my memo outlining a Trask radio acquisition and has
been passing it off as her own idea.
Tess
It was my idea! She stole it from me! I swear!
Katherine
Good God, Tess. Don't you know when to stop?
Tess
But you're lying!
Katherine
Oh!...Thank you....Oh, thank you. Thank you all so much. The
up-side is that I have found out in time to control the damage.
We have containment and we have a deal on the table. I
say...pass me a set of papers and let's get on with it.
Trask
Who's running this thing?
Jack
Just a second, please. Wha...?
Tess
I know you don't believe me, but...Oh, it doesn't matter. I'm
sorry. I'm sorry.
Jack
Well, gentlemen...the players may have changed, but the game
remains the same, and the name of the game is ""Let's Make a
Deal."" If you'll all turn to page twenty-two in your prospectus,
I'd like to take you through the terms of transferal.
SCENE 71
Tess
Well, they did it.
Mick
Yeah..they sure did.
Tess


                                Page 45/54

You really look great. How are you?
Mick
Good. Good. Business is great and uh...
Doreen
Mick, did you see me? I caught it one-handed...Oh, hi.
Tess
Hey, Doreen.
Mick
And my boat's booked through three weeks from now. Doreen's
working the lines for me.
Tess
That's great. Really.
Mick
So how's life in the fast lane?
Tess
Well, um...fast. It's real fasts and busy and....It's good to
see you, Mick. I guess I better...get....
Mick
Yeah, it's good to see you, too.
SCENE 72
Secretary #1
Cyn told us about what happened. It really bites the big one,
Tess. Really.
Secretary #2
We took up a little collection.
Tess
Thanks.
Secretary #2
It's not much. It's just enough to go out and get toasted some
night when you really need it. Don't say no. We really wanted
to. And no paying the Con Ed with it.
Tess
Okay, thanks.
Secretary #3
So what are you gonna do now, huh?
Tess
Oh, you know. Start all over. Find a job, a place to live. And
just wise up and not take the whole thing so seriously. I'll be
okay. 'Bye.
Secretary #2
'Bye, sweetie.
Tess
Thank you.
Secretary #2


                               Page 46/54

Miss you.
Tess
Thanks.
Secretary #4
So long, Tess.
Secretary #5
Good luck!
Secretary #6
'Bye, Tess.
Tess
'Bye. Don't work too hard.
Secretary #7
Good-bye, Tess.
Tess
'Bye.
SCENE 73
Man
Sorry.
Tess
Shit!
Jack
I've been trying to find you.
Tess
Just leave me alone.
Jack
Just one thing. Was you and me just part of the...scheme, too?
Tess
No! Look, if I told you I was just some secretary, you never
would've taken the meeting. I mean, think about it. Maybe you
would've fed me a few drinks and then tried to get me into the
sack. End of story.
Jack
That's not true.
Tess
Are you sure about that? Can you honestly tell me that it
wouldn't have made a difference? I mean, who's fooling who here?
Katherine
What's this? More stolen files?
Tess
No, it's my stuff from the desk.
Katherine
Your stuff? Now there's a broad term.
Tess
No, it's my stuff. Look, you, maybe you can fool these guys with


                                Page 47/54

this saint act that you've got down, but don't you ever speak to
me again like we don't know what really happened! You got me?!
Katherine
Tess, this is business. Let's just bury the hatchet. Okay?
Tess
You know where you can bury your hatchet?! Now get your bony ass
out of my sight! (To Jack): And if you really think that I said
I loved you as part of scheme, then that is really pathetic...you
know?!
Katherine
My God, she'll stop at nothing.
SCENE 74
Trask
What the hell kind of show are you people running here?
Katherine
Oren, I'm sorry you've had to see this, but it means nothing to
us. Jack, let's get upstairs.
Jack
Not without her.
Katherine
Jack!
Trask
Trainer...are you trying to blow this deal?
Jack
No, sir. I'm trying to make sure that it gets done right. Tess
is this team's leader. She put this deal together. We shouldn't
proceed without her.
Trask
And you shouldn't go letting your Johnson make business decisions
for you.
Jack
I'm not, sir. I'm telling you, she's your man.
Trask
Oh? And what brings you to that conclusion?
Jack
She said so, and I believe her.
Trask
I'm afraid that's not good enough. Now are you with us or not?
Jack
No.
Katherine
Jack, I forgive you. Now get on this elevator.
Jack
Sorry, Katherine.


                                 Page 48/54

Katherine
You will be sorry, Jack.
Tess
Ask her to tell about the hole in your deal.
Trask
What hole?
Katherine
Oren, she's just playing games again. Let's get going.
Tess
Fine. Go.
Trask
No. What hole?
Tess
Look?
Katherine
The People Page? Now this is ridiculous.
Messenger
Come on, you guys.
Katherine
""Former Miss America Dawn Bixby has been house-hunting here.
Seems Dawn and hot, hot, hot D.J. hubby Slim Slicker are getting
ready to take a bite out of the Big Apple.""
Businessman
Slim Slicker.
Katherine
So?
Jack
Slim Slicker's one of Metro's major assets. Syndicated to all
their stations. Number one in his slot. The cornerstone of
their programming.
Tess
You lose him, and Metro's just some okay real estate with falling
ratings. And you're not exactly buying it for a write-off.
Jack
Better make sure he's locked in before they sign anything.
Katherine
Oren, I have this covered. Upstairs. Shall we?
Messenger
Yes.
Katherine
Oren!
SCENE 75
Jack
Hear the lady out, sir. There's another elevator.


                                 Page 49/54

Trask
Fine.
Jack
You're on.
Tess
Okay. See, this is Forbes. It's just your basic article about
how you were looking to expand into broadcasting, right? Okay
now, the same day, I'll never forget this. I'm reading page six
of the Post, and there's this item on Bobby Stein, the radio talk
show guy who does all those gross jokes about Ethiopia and the
Betty Ford Center. Well, anyway, he's hosting this charity
auction that night...real blue bloods, and won't that be funny?
Now turn the page to Suzy, who does the society stuff, and
there's this picture of your daughter.
Trask
Ah.
Tess
See, nice picture. And she's helping to organize the charity
ball. So I started to think, ""Trask, radio...Trask, radio."" And
then I hooked up with Jack, and he came on board with Metro,
and...and so now here we are.
SCENE 76
Katherine
Oren, we really don't have any more time for fairy tales.
Trask
Well, Miss Parker...let me ask you a question. How did you come
up with the idea for Trask to buy up Metro?
Katherine
How did I, uh...? Well, let's see, the, um...
Trask
The impulse. What led you to put the two together?
Katherine
Well, you know, I would have to check my files. I can't recall
exactly the, um...
Trask
Oh, generally. It's not as if it was in the mainstream.
Katherine
You know, it would have to be the, um...Jack...help me out
here....Oren, I beg your pardon, but if you are insinuating...
Trask
Miss Parker, if I were you...I'd go to your office and take a
long last look around. Because in about five minutes, I'm going
to see to it that you get the boot...but good!
Katherine


                                 Page 50/54

Oren, this is a simple misunderstanding, and I...You cannot...
Trask
I can and I will! Now get your...(To Tess): What did you call
it?
Tess & Jack
Bony ass.
Trask
Right. Bony ass out of my sight!
Katherine
I'm sorry...but I simply won't stand for that kind of talk. Will
you excuse me, please?
SCENE 77
Trask
Why didn't you tell us all this in the board room that day?
Tess
Well, no one was gonna listen, sir, not to me. I mean, you can
bend the rules plenty, once you get upstairs, but not while
you're trying to get there. And if you're someone like me, you
can't get there without bending the rules.
Trask
Mmm. You've got a real fire in your belly. Or was this just a
one-time stunt that you pulled?
Tess
I'm not sure what you mean. I have something in my belly, but I
think it's nervous knots.
Trask
I mean, are you willing to go out on that limb every day, working
for me? Legitimately?
Tess
Yes, sir.
Trask
Have to be right at the entry level. Any problem with that?
Tess
No, sir.
Trask
Gumption, Miss McGill.
Tess
Yes, sir.
Trask
See you tomorrow.
Tess
Okay.
Trask
Trainer, Dwayne...let's go back to my office and see about this


                                 Page 51/54

Slim what's-his-name's contract.
Jack
Be right with you, sir.
Secretary #2
Way to go, Tess! Way to go!
Secretary #1
Beauty!
SCENE 78
Tess
Thank you.
Jack
For you. You like it? Peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Milk
money. Twinkies. Pen, pencil, ruler. Apple for the teacher.
Now remember...play nice with the other kids...and make sure
you're home before dark.
SCENE 79
Man #1
I sold her three options.
Man #2
I sold her two.
Man #1
What are you gonna do?
Tess
Hi. Tess McGill.
Receptionist
Good morning.
Tess
Good morning.
Receptionist
The director is out sick today, so she'll want to see you first
thing tomorrow.
Tess
Mm-hmm.
Receptionist
Um...Miss Baxter's already up there. She'll show you the layout.
Tess
Okay.
Receptionist
It's all the way at the end of the hall.
Tess
All right. Thank you.
Receptionist
You're welcome.
SCENE 80


                                Page 52/54

Alice

(On telephone):
terrorist...I mean, just something semi-human. (To Tess): Oh!
I didn't hear you come in. I'm Alice Baxter.
Tess
Tess McGill.
Alice
I was just...using the phone.
Tess
Yes, well...that happens.
Alice
How 'bout some coffee?
Tess
Sure. Just tell me where.
Alice
No, I'll get it. Um...oh...how?
Tess
Milk and sugar, please. Thank you.
Alice
Uh...Miss McGill?
Tess
Yes?
Alice
That's your desk. In there.
Tess
I don't think so.
Alice
Oh, yes. I sit out here.
Tess
I'm sorry. I thought the secretary would sit out here.
Alice
That's right. I'm the secretary. If it's okay, I prefer
""assistant.""
SCENE 81
Alice
You've got a ten o'clock meeting with Slater from Development,
here. Eleven o'clock with Donahue from Logistics...his office is
on twenty-three, and lunch with Mr. Trask, his office downtown,
one o'clock. It's all right there on the computer. Just hit
shift-S for your schedule.
Tess
Um...when I saw you...in here on the phone with your feet up, I
figured this was your office.


                                Page 53/54

Alice
I'm sorry about that, Miss McGill. It won't happen again, ever.
Tess
It's okay.
Alice
Maybe now would be good time to go over what you expect of me.
Tess
Um...I, uh...I expect you to call me Tess. I don't expect you to
fetch me coffee unless you're getting some for yourself. And,
um...the rest we'll just make up as we go along. Okay?
Alice
Okay. I'll be...right outside if you need anything.
Tess
Fine.
SCENE 82
Tess
Cyn...guess where I am?
Cyn
You got out! Oh, my God! I can't believe it! She's out! She
made it out! She got out! She has her own office!

Your Sister's Sister
       By Lynn Shelton




          Page 1/60

1
- You guys...
how long were you dating?
- About a year.
- And you met in college, right?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
It was about
seven years ago.
But I'm more... I'm friends
with Jack, you know.
(people chattering)
- He used to take a frying pan
and just put cheese in it.
And he'd roll it up.
- Is this true?
- It's absolutely true.
You've said that before.
- It's absolutely true.
- He'd call it... he's like,
""Oh, I made my cheese log.""
- I needed a wheelchair.
So one night, we went
to an emergency room entrance,
and we stole a wheelchair
and took it out back.
And he was pushing me
down the hill.
- Tom did that?
- Yeah, it was... he knew
that I needed a wheelchair.
- He used to have one of those,
uh, those Sunfishes,
you know, the boats
that have the one...
- The one sail?
- The one sail.
Yeah, yeah, free version.
He would go out,
and he would be gone
for, like, six or seven hours.
And we'd be, like,
really worried,
because we couldn't see him
from the shore.


                                   Page 2/60

- What was that band called?
- It was a band called Bigfoot.
- No, it was...
(all talking at once)
- 'Cause he was
a marine biologist.
He liked big fish.
- Well, yes, but the thing is,
there was a name
attached to the wheelchair.
So it was for someone.
- Yeah, we've been friends
for a long time.
- Yeah.
- Mark was one of these guys who
would, like, walk into a room.
You know, like we could be
at a party.
You could have the one person
in the room,
playing you, for example.
Like, no one was talking.
(all chattering)
- No, but there's something
to be said for just somebody
who just makes people
feel comfortable.
- He did.
He did.
(people chattering)
- We were just walking down
the street.
(all chattering and laughing)
(glass clinking)
- Yeah, yeah.
Thank you.
- You got it.
- Trying make this, like,
a respectable event.
Uh, I...
uh, it's been a year.
And, uh,
I thought it was
really important


                                   Page 3/60

that we do this for Tom.
It's so hard to eulogize someone
who you look up to, you know,
'cause Tom was amazing.
He was the best fucking guy.
I mean, he was a better friend
to all of us
than we were to him.
I mean, at least,
that's how I feel.
I just think back.
We were roommates at UW.
And, like, I remember, like,
at one point,
Sara came to visit me.
And he moved all of his stuff
into the common room
to sleep there.
No, and he really...
and I was like,
""It smells bad.""
And he was like, ""No""...
He was like, ""No, no, no.
I'm gonna do it
so you can have sex.""
And I was like,
""We're not having sex.""
I would... and he was like,
""But I'm optimistic, you know.""
And so I...
and he was just so generous,
you know.
He was just...
he was the best.
And I was just thinking today,
I mean,
I saw Hotel Rwanda came on TV.
And he... he and I saw it
together in the theater.
And the day after it came out,
he started donating time at
the shelter in downtown Seattle.
That's what he was like.
You'd sit there


                                   Page 4/60

thinking about it,
and he would do it.
And just cheers... you know,
I just want to say ""cheers""
to that.

ALL:
- To Tom.
- To Tom.
- Cheers.
- Tom and I were big
into movies,
you know, growing up.
Actually, Tom and I, like,
had a seminal
movie experience together
not dissimilar
from Hotel Rwanda,
except it was with
Revenge of the Nerds.
(all chuckle)
And it was fascinating.
It sort of...
it changed him,
um, 'cause Tom
was not like you know him
when he was younger.
Tom was...
he was the bully,
I found out, like, when I went
to pick him up from school.
And, um, he was
quite emotionally
and physically manipulative.
And when I watched him watching
Revenge of the Nerds,
just something clicked in him,
which was, he was learning
that, like,
the bullies and the assholes
end up last,
and the nerds
and the nice guys win.
And his little brain


                                  Page 5/60

started clocking away
and going ""Oh, fuck.""
""If I'm gonna gain favor
in this world,""
""I'm gonna be nice.""
""I'm gonna be altruistic.""
""I'm gonna watch Hotel Rwanda
and volunteer at a shelter,""
""'cause girls will like that.""
""I will get laid.""
""I'll get better job.""
""I'll succeed forward
in the life""...
- I don't think
that's what it is.
- But the purist vers...
- I don't think that
that's accurate.
- Al?
Hey, Al?
I know you spent
some time with him
in the last couple of years,
but I... but he's my brother.
- I just think you're gonna hold
someone to something
that happened when they were
fucking 14 years old
or whatever he was
when that happened.
- If we're gonna toast the man,
let's toast the man.
Let's not eulogize somebody like
a fucking bullshit...
- Just the way you're saying
it is just like he's a dick.
And it's like, he wasn't a dick.
He was amazing.
- You're calling my brother
a dick?
I'm not calling my brother
a dick.
- Jack!
- I'm just saying,


                                   Page 6/60

let's not do what everybody does
at a funeral
or a commemoratory ceremony
where we just say,
""Uh, they were amazing,
and they were generous,""
'cause that's fucking bullshit.
And it's a dishonor to the man.
- So cheers.
- No, I think
I'm gonna finish, Al,
'cause I'm his brother.
If we're gonna raise our glass,
I want to raise our glass
to the man.
You know half of the man,
and I know the whole man, okay?
Who was fucking beautiful.
He knew how to make himself work
and weave in the world.
And I think
that's fucking great.
And I would never call him
a dick for that,
so fuck you
for saying that.
But let's raise a glass
to the whole man.
Cheers.
Thank you.
(quietly)
Cheers.
So, anyway, I was...
we should say something.
But does anyone
want another drink?
Or, uh...
(groans)
Oh, boy.
(sighs loudly)
- How'd that go for you?
When you wrote it,
how did you see that
actually playing out for you?


                                   Page 7/60

(groans)
I will say this.
Some parties are forgettable.
(chuckles)
- You know what I mean?
But I got to say,
this party...
- Had great guacamole
and amazing public speaking.
- Great public speaking.
They'll remember it.
- You got to stop.
You know that, right?
- Oh, this is...
this is that moment...
- This is your intervention.
- Isn't it?
This is...
this is hard Iris.
- I miss you.
I miss my friend.
I know you're sad.
I'm sad too.
- Yeah.
You know what I always
think about?
I think about, like, you're...
that must have been so hard
for you to leave Tom.
That fucking guy loved you.
Man.
You are so...
but you were right,
and you were so brave,
and you were so right.
- It wasn't right with us.
- No, it wasn't right
with you guys.
But that's okay.
Can I tell you something?
I turned down the Trinity job.
- Why?
- I don't want to go to Trinity
and show them who I am


                                  Page 8/60

right now,
because they'll never
hire me again.
And so that almost means,
like,
I don't want to go another party
and show them
who I am right now.
And I don't want to go to a girl
and show her who I am
right now...
- You're a mess.
- Well...
- I've been watching you
for a year now,
and whatever you're doing,
and whatever you think
is helping you,
I have a responsibility
as your friend
to tell you
that it's not.
- I knew this was coming,
by the way.
- Okay.
- Just tell me what to do.
- Okay.
- That's basically where I'm at.
Just tell me what...
- Okay, all right.
- You know better than I do.
You know I...
I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing.
- I know.
I have a plan.
- You have a plan?
- I just want you
to hear me out.
It's just a plan right now.
- I love your plans.
- You might not love this one,
but just hear me out.
- But I don't have any plans.


                                   Page 9/60

- Um, that's the good news.
You know, uh, you know that
nice red bicycle that you have?
(belches)
Yes.
- Yikes.
- Sorry.
(laughing)
What you're going to do...
you're gonna dust off
Old Red,
you're gonna wheel him
out of the shed,
and you're gonna get on a ferry.
I'm sending you
to my dad's place.
You know my dad's place
on the island?
It's beautiful in the winter.
It's idyllic and crisp
and peaceful and...
- Like, by ""beautiful"" you mean,
""rainy and cold.""
- I'm sorry;
I got so distracted,
'cause all I heard was
pissing and moaning.
- Right.
Sorry, I started pissing.
I'm not pissing.
I'm not pissing and moaning.
I'm done.
I'm done.
- You just need
some head space, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
So then you're gonna take
a right on a road
called Dunhill Road.
And the house is right
at the end of the street.
And it's the only house
on the lane.


                                   Page 10/60

- Okay.
Um, I mean, seriously,
I'm just going not...
like, what am I doing out here?
- You just sit there,
and you look out at the water,
and you think
about your life.
- Really?
I'm just gonna sit?
- You're just gonna sit.
There's no TV.
There's no internet.
There's nothing.
It's just you.
- Do they have forks,
'cause I might...
- They have a couple...
we have a couple of forks,
yeah.
- I might need to stab myself
in the face.
(laughs)
- Will you please come visit me,
please?
- No, Jack.
I can't.
This is... I can't anyway,
'cause I'm slammed.
But I can't because this is...
this is for you, you know.
Don't make me feel bad
about sending you off.
- All right, I'm gonna go have
the greatest time ever
doing nothing.
And if I don't come back
within a week,
bring a razor
and deodorant.
(laughs)
(peaceful acoustic guitar music)
(bicycle wheels clicking)
(leaves rustling)


                                   Page 11/60

(sighs)
(grunts)
(breathing heavily)
clang!
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
(both scream)
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Hi, hi, I'm...
- Ahh!
- Okay.
I think I have the wrong house.
And I... I...
Hey, Hannah!
You're Hannah!
Oh, my God, I'm so...
I'm so sorry.
I'm Jack.
I'm Iris' friend Jack.
- You're Jack?
- Yes, I'm so sorry
I freaked you out.
- Holy fuck!
- Sorry.
- Are you kidding me?
What are you doing, like,
creeping around my house?
- I was looking for the key.
And I'm so sorry.
I didn't... I didn't even see
anything, so it's fine.
- Fuck me.
- Sorry, that's my fault.
That's...
Anyway, not to beat
a dead horse,
but just to be super clear,
I was looking
for the key out front,
and I thought maybe
it was on the side.
You know, and that's really...
- Ring the bell.


                                  Page 12/60

Just ring the bell, dude.
- Yeah, but I didn't know
anybody was here,
so why would I ring
the bell?
- You know what?
Just... let's drop it, okay?
It's just...
it's done.
- Anyway, sorry.
But look, you obviously
came here to, what,
get some alone time,
and I'm clearly barging in.
So I don't know, I'll just get
a cheap hotel, I think,
and it'll be fine.
- No, it's fine.
You can... you could stay.
Yeah, it's fine.
Stay.
- I don't want to intrude.
I really don't.
- Look, Iris invited you up.
You're a guest.
You're welcome to stay.
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
There's plenty of room.
I'm sure we won't even
run into each other.
Are you hungry?
There's bananas.
- Those are bananas?
- Well, they're dehydrated.
- Oh, okay.
I'm good.
Thank you.
But yeah, if you're okay,
I'm... I will crash.
- Okay, I'm okay.
Stop saying, ""Are you okay?""
- Well, I just want to make sure
you're okay.


                                   Page 13/60

Um, what... is there a bedroom
I should take?
- Yeah, just go past
where we had the standoff,
and it's the first bedroom
on the right.
- Oh, past the... the creepy guy
with the bike helmet?
- Yeah, where the crazy lady
was brandishing the oar.
- She was scary.
I hope she's gone.
- Good night.
- Do you think
we'll see her again?
- Maybe.
(sighs)
(sighs)
(groans)
(object clatters)
(door clicks)
Can I come in?
(sighs)
- There's glasses
on the windowsill,
you know,
if you want to join me.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
One thing in common
with your little sister.
- What, the lush factor?
- Ah, the self-aware
lush factor.
- Oh.
- Very important.
Big difference.
So you're on an island.

It's 3:
and you're drinking by yourself.
- Yeah.
- What's going on?


                                   Page 14/60

- Really?
- I'm not good for small talk,
so I apologize
if I'm, uh, barging through
the doors of your privacy
right now.
- Yeah, it's okay.
You kind of are, but, it's...
- I am.
I apologize.
Let's talk about your slippers.
- Okay.
Let's talk about my slippers.
- Your slippers are awesome.
- I just walked out
on a seven-year relationship.
- Whoa.
- Hence the tequila.
- Hence the tequila.
- What's your story?
Mm, nothing really.
I just kind of had
a shitty year.
You know, thought it'd be nice
to have a little sabbatical,
get some alone time.
- Okay, good place for it.
- Good place for it.
- Obviously.
- Getting the alone time.
But I got to say,
not so terrible
to have a drinking buddy.
- Yeah.
- You are not
what I expected, Hannah.
- How so?
- You are, uh...
I don't know.
Just not how Iris
described you to me, I guess.
- How did she describe me?
- She... well,
if you don't know already,


                                  Page 15/60

she worships you
and looks up to you
and thinks you are amazing.
And she loves you.
- Yeah?
- It's true.
- What else?
- Well, I don't...
- Give me the dirt!
Come on!
- What am I supposed to say?
She loves you.
She thinks you're amazing.
- Well, I love her.
I think she's amazing.
- Well, good.
Well, drink your drink.
- You drink your drink.
Don't tell me to drink my drink.
- Well, I'm drinking my drink.
You drink that one.
Watch this.
- Oh, yeah?
Watch this.
- Wham!
Okay.
Do you have any brothers
or sisters?
- Now you're talking.
I had a brother.
- That's right.
I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
- I knew that.
- Don't.
- That's... I'm sorry.
That's my bad.
- Why are you sorry?
- I don't know.
- There's nothing
to be sorry about.
I used to have a brother,
and I don't anymore.
And that's what it is, you know?


                                   Page 16/60

It's like,
it is what it is,
and it sucks.
And it... you know, it was,
you know,
it was terrible, obviously.
But, um...
but I'm good.
And, um, thank you for that.
But it's not necessary.
- To your brother.
- To your sister.
And her sister, being you.
- That would be me.
- Yeah.
- I guess
I better drink then.
- Come on.
Mm-mm!
Mm-mm.
- I can't.
- Look, if we're gonna
drink to someone
as awesome as your sister
and my dead brother,
we're throwing
the shit back.
- Okay.
- Come on, wham it.
Mm!
There it is.
- Holy shit.
- Yet another similarity
with you and Iris.
I can talk her into drinking
anything.
I can't believe you let me
talk you into that.
That's really great.
You want another one?
(festive salsa music)
Okay, my best friend
is your sister.
- Right.


                               Page 17/60

- It's like a kind of in-law,
of sort, that makes us.
You know what I'm saying?
- What are you talking about?
- I'm doing...
- Yeah, no, no, no, go, go, go.
I cut you off when you were
actually going
with something good.
- I'm drawing
a brilliant parallel.
Go again.
(mumbling)
Going down.
Getting weird with the...
(slurring) All right,
let me tell you something.
- Yeah!
- All right,
it's not that I was...
I was in love with her.
I was totally fucking
in love with her.
But what I was in love with
was the potential that
she was holding that was me.
- Right.
- Does that make sense?
- Right.
- That's what I was
in love with.
- Right, right.
- Was that.
- And then I started
to realize, like,
it was like I gave her
all my, like, zhuzh,
all my good stuff.
Is this making any sense?
- Yeah.
You shouldn't do that.
- And, like... and she
wouldn't give it back.
So, like, as the... as the...


                                  Page 18/60

as, like, the years went on
and everything went on,
I was just, like...
this is gonna sound
so fucking melodramatic.
I was, like, this fucking,
like, little fucking bird,
Like, in a cage.
And finally she came over
and unlocked it,
and I just sat there.
- Wow.
- I sat there
for three more months
when she was hooking up
with a...
(gagging)
Ugh, this woman, girl,
who's so much younger than me.
And I just couldn't...
I just sat there
and waited for her
to be attracted
to me again
or to just look at me
like I was, uh...
- Whoa.
We're gonna stop
this conversation.
I got a sense of it, okay?
And here's the deal.
I've made a decision.
Pam is a fucking moron.
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?
- She's not really, but...
- No, here's the deal.
Look, for her to have
given you the sense
in some way that you're not,
Like, young enough
or good enough or pretty enough
or just enough in general
is fucking bullshit.


                                  Page 19/60

- It is, right?
- It's bullshit.
Because what I see
across from me is...
you have to...
you're gonna have to let me
descend here for a second;
can I descend?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.
I have to tell you something,
and I don't want you
to take it the wrong way.
It's to prove a point, okay?
But it's about your butt.
So when I...
(laughs)
What?
- When I...
when I went to look for...
- You are a fucker.
- I am.
- You were fucking peeping
in the fucking windows.
You're a fucker.
Give me some more.
You are a fucking...
go ahead...
yeah, no, I want to hear
your confession.
Confess.
- I tried to find the key.
I went around the door,
all innocent
up until that point.
Innocent, innocent, innocent.
Looking for the key,
total innocence,
total innocence.
Through the window:
your butt.
- Pervert.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.


                                Page 20/60

- But you made me that way.
- I made you that way?
- 'Cause your butt is
fucking awesome, okay?
- Can you not?
- 'Cause it's, like, super soft.
- How do you know
it's super soft?
- 'Cause I could tell.
- You're so fucking weird...
- I know.
- And drunk right now.
- I know.
I looked at it for a while.
I got a good sense of it.
And let me tell you
another thing
that's even more inappropriate,
but it's super safe
'cause you're a lesbian.
If I were differently equipped
or you were
differently inclined,
this night might go
a very different way.
- Really?
- I'm just saying...
- Are you just saying?
- I would be super open to that
in a whole other universe...
- Okay.
- Because... and this is just
serving to prove my point of,
Like, you shouldn't feel
not awesome
because she was
not interested in you.
There will be a lot of people...
- Well, I didn't say
she wasn't interested in me.
The fucking thing
ran its course.
But anyway, go ahead.
I like it.


                                   Page 21/60

I like it.
- To your gorgeous,
supple, soft,
sexy motherfucking butt.
(sighs)
- And all the other things
that I might be thinking about
except for the fact that
I'm not thinking about them.
- I'm just saying...
- Anyway, the point is, you,
you're never going to be happy
if you're eating
this fucking bird food.
You think... you know why
you feel like a bird?
- I love that food.
- You feel like a bird?
Okay, what the fuck is this?
It's a turd.
You can't eat these things.
I am here, Dr. Jack,
to fix you, okay?
So I'm gonna make you round,
tall filet, super awesome.
Grocery store.
Cook it medium-rare.
- I can't do it.
- With the butter.
- I can't eat meat.
You can make me something else.
- Okay, I'll make you
something else.
I'll make you a super
awesome steak medium-rare
with the butter
and the blue cheese
and the truffle oil drizzled
over the French fries.
And I'm gonna put this plate
in front of you.
And it's gonna be
totally different.
It'll be a change of pace.


                                  Page 22/60

But you are out of the cage now,
my friend.
And if you want to fucking fly,
you're gonna start with a steak.
That's all I'm saying.
- Let's do it.
- All right, we're going
to the store...
- No, let's do it.
- I'm gonna fucking cook you
a meal.
- Hey!
All right.
I'm gonna take you up
on your offer.
- What are you doing?
- I haven't, uh,
been on that bicycle
in quite some time, but...
- What are you... what?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you serious?
- Yeah.
I'm single.
You're single.
- I'm single.
- I mean, maybe it's a bad idea.
- It's not a bad idea.
- No, maybe it's a bad idea.
- It's not a bad idea.
- No, we shouldn't do it.
You're a straight guy.
- I'm looking at your boobs.
- It might be too much.
It might be too much for you.
Too much for you to handle.
What?
- You're serious.
- I don't know.
I mean,
I'm game if you're game.
Okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.


                                   Page 23/60

- Get rid of this.
Get rid of this.
Holy shit.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Shit, shit, shit, I don't have...
I don't...
I didn't bring a...
I don't have a condom.
Well, I didn't...
I thought I was gonna be alone.
- Condom!
- Oh, fuck.
Saran Wrap?
- I think I know where
there's one.
- Okay, oh, all right.
Uh...
Um...
Okay.
(sighs)
Wait, wait, wait.
Stay right there.
Don't move, don't move,
don't move.
I got to show you something.
I've always wanted to do this.
Okay.
You ready?
- Yes.
- Ta-da!
- All right.
- You're very underwhelmed.
Okay, never mind.
- Wait.
All right.
I'm gonna do it.
- Whoa, you're really
going for it.
- Is that on?
- Uh, snap it.
Snap it.
Okay, good.
Give me this.


                                    Page 24/60

Give me this.
(yelps)
- Okay, sorry.
Okay, I got it.
I got it.
Okay.
- Let me get these off.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Wow.
Wow.
Okay.
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.
(groans)
- Oh, shit, you're amazing.
(both moaning)
- Oh, sorry.
Wait a second.
(squeals)
Oh, shit.
I squealed.
Sorry.
(sighing and moaning)
- Did you...
okay.
- Yeah, sorry.
That was...
it wasn't supposed to be
that fast.
- Oh, good.
- I can... I can help, uh...
- No, it's okay.
- Finish for you, if you want.
- Oh, no.
Thank you.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Ow, you're on my hair.
- Sorry.
- All right, um...
Well...
You want to snuggle?


                                 Page 25/60

- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Go for it.
- Okay.
- Maybe not that close.
- We should get some...
we should get some water too
before we go to sleep.
- Okay.
- Good night.
Thank you.
(birds chirping)
(ferry horn blows)
(sighs)
- She's here, she's here,
she's here, she's here.
Get up, get up, get up, get up.
Oh, ew!
Oh, shit.
Fuck.
Where'd it go?
Where'd it go?
Where'd it go?
Where'd it go?
Okay, you have to get up.
Iris is in the driveway.
Dude, she's in the driveway.
Give me some tissues.
Give me some tissue.
Come on.
Okay.
Very important, okay?
She cannot know about this.
I am running or something.
You are sleeping.
And we're good, okay?
Just...
- What?
- Jack?
What the fuck is that?
- Hey, Bean.
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?
- Puppet?


                                  Page 26/60

What the fuck?
Oh, my goodness!
What are you doing here?
- Oh.
- Oh, it's so nice to see you.
I didn't know
you were going to be here.
- Yeah, it's a long story.
- Did you just wake up?
You okay?
These are cute.
These are really...
- Holy cow!
- And you've met...
oh, Jesus Christ.
- What?
- What have you come as?
- I was on a run.
- Here she is.
- Hannah showed me
a great path, and...
- Jane Fonda.
- Oh, cut it out.
- Oh, yummy.
You're sweaty.
- Oh, what are you doing here?
What is going on?
- Did you meet my sister?
I've been wanting you
to meet her.
- I did.
We met last night.
Yes, we did.
- How nice is this?
I've been wanting you guys
to meet for so long.
Haven't I been talking about it?
And it's weird.
It's weird that you haven't met,
so I love it.
- I know.
It's crazy.
How... what... why are you...
how did the...


                                   Page 27/60

what are you doing here?
- I got off work.
I just was, like...
they moved a shoot
and then axed another one,
so I was, like, ""Peace out.
I'm gonna go
and annoy my friend.""
- That's so great!
- This is amazing
that she's here as well.
- I know.
You were like, ""Go up
for a solo sabbatical except""...
- I know.
I know.
You're supposed
to have alone time,
and now you're, like,
double whammy!
(laughs)
- Two of them here.
- That was a big run.
- Yeah, it was really good.
- Yeah.
I need to pee.
I'm literally
gonna pee my pants.
I got you provisions and stuff.
I love that you're here.
Where did you guys sleep?
- That was a bit much.
It's, like, pouring off
your head.
- So... yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Took my room.
- I hate my room.
- You do hate your room.
Don't be weird
and change the sheets.
It's fine.
- I broke up with Pam.


                                   Page 28/60

- What?
Holy shit.
Why...
when?
- A couple of days ago.
I got up here yesterday.
I hitchhiked up.
- You didn't hitchhike up.
Please don't hitchhike.
It's so dangerous.
(sighs)
Shit.
- I had no idea that...
are you all right?
Please don't change
the sheets.
- I want to change the sheets.
- Don't change the sheets.
- Let me change the sheets.
I want to change the sheets.
- I want to talk to you about...
I had no idea you guys
were having trouble.
Hannah.
(whispers)
Why didn't you call me?
- I don't know;
I knew we were in trouble
when we weren't
being physical anymore.
But, I mean,
that was totally my fault.
I was just so fucking angry
with her all the time.
- Yeah, of course you were.
She's suffocating.
- No.
Well, she was suffocating.
- She was suffocating.
- No, but it was me too.
It was because
I was buying in to this...
I was...
what did I say to you


                                   Page 29/60

last night?
I had a good metaphor
for it last night.
- Did you guys talk
about this last night?
- Yes, I was shitfaced,
and I was
pouring out my heart.
- You know what?
I am gonna need some herbs.
Would you mind getting something
from the garden?
- Do you need it right now,
or do you want to...
- It would be great
so that it could marinate.
- What?
- I do feel like sooner
rather than later would be good,
just so they can marinate.
- Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
Um, but I want to know...
I want to know what the...
- I'll remember where I was.
- I didn't know any of this,
what the breaking point...
- It's not the kind of stuff
you talk about.
- I know.
- Yeah.
- All right,
what do you want me to do?
- Um, real quick.
I've been thinking,
since the bottle of tequila
was pretty much empty,
I think the way we pitch it is,
you were here drinking,
and I came in, and we talked
for, like, 20 minutes.
Then you went to bed.
I stayed up
finishing the tequila.


                                   Page 30/60

And then that way, it's like,
we hung out a little bit
but not so much
that it's suspicious.
You know what I'm saying?
Is that cool with you?
- What are you talking about?
I mean, seriously,
what are you talking about?
- Okay,
don't you think we both agree
it's better
if Iris just doesn't know?
- Why?
- Because she's your sister,
and I'm her best friend...
- Yeah?
- And it's weird.
- Weird, what?
Well, it's weird
that we had sex.
I mean, I'm not particularly
proud of it.
But I don't think
she would give a shit.
- What do you mean
you're not proud of it?
- Come on.
Whatever, anyway, go ahead.
You want me to make up a story
to throw her off the track
so that she doesn't know
that we had sex?
- That sounds terrible
when you say it like that.
- Right.
- Okay?
- Do you have a thing
for my sister?
- I knew
you were gonna say this.
This is why I didn't want
to say anything.
I do not have a thing


                                 Page 31/60

for your sister.
- You have a thing
for my sister.
- I don't have a thing
for your sister.
Here's the deal.
- Okay.
- I think it would be bad
for all of us
if Iris knows about this.
I'm not just thinking...
- You are freaking me out
on so many levels right now.
- You don't think she'd be upset
if you told her we had sex?
- I don't think
she would give a shit, no.
- Wow.
- I hate to break it to you...
(door clicking)
- Hi!
- Hey!
I've got sage as well.
I don't know if that's any good.
- Uh, sage is great actually.
Perfect.
Thank you.
- So what was the point when...
what was it
when you decided that...
- You know what? I don't want
to talk about it anymore.
- No.
But I haven't heard any of it.
- I'm starting to get
so irritable,
because it's just
a bad topic.
- Let's listen to some music.
Why don't we do that?
- I'll put some music on.
- Yeah, let's do music.
That sounds good.
- Did she tell you about


                                   Page 32/60

the Pam thing last night?
- What's that?
- Did she tell you about Pam?
- We touched on it.
- How's this?
- It's okay.
- Can you not talk about me
when I'm in the same area?
- I'm just saying,
I think I'm a little upset
that this guy is, like,
all clued up on your breakup
and I don't know anything.
- Here's the deal.
New rule.
No talking behind anybody's
backs in this house, all right?
- All right.
- Um, we don't do that.
- Okay.
- Yeah, good.
- Okay, I know you don't want
to talk about it anymore.
That's fine.
- Yeah.
- That's totally fine.
- Let's just move on.
- All right.
- Sounds good to me.
This place is incredible.
- Mm-hmm.
- I know you said at some point
it was renovated, but...
- You don't understand
how beautiful this place was.
- You don't understand.
It was...
- I mean, it was insane.
- It was beautiful.
- It was just so pure
and gorgeous,
and then Marilyn came in
and just eradicated
any memory of us.


                                  Page 33/60

And, so the house, yes,
is very beautiful...
- Without the stink of us.
- Yeah.
- But Marilyn's only got
a couple more years left.
- It's two and a half, three.
- Two and a half,
three more years.
- Yeah, I think so.
- What, are you...
I'm sorry, what?
Three to go?
- The ten-year itch.
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, he was with her mum
for ten years,
had an affair with my mum,
who was his secretary.
- Got your mom Lenora pregnant.
- Yes.
- Married her.
- Moved to London.
- Moved to London.
- Got bored of Lenora,
and then he moved on.
And then he kind of philandered
around for, like, seven years.
- He went through
his crazy Warren Beatty phase.
The funny thing, though,
about those years,
when he was so bad
with the ladies,
he was so good with us,
because that was...
- He wasn't.
- No, but that was, like,
six summers
that it was just
the three of us here.
- I know, but you were okay
with that.
I had no respect for that.


                                  Page 34/60

He just went... he dodged
from one to the other,
and it was gross.
- That's so crazy.
So he would just, like,
date all these women,
Like, for short periods
of time
with not a lot
of emotional investment?
- Yeah, it was horrible.
- And they were very similar,
and then he would just move on?
- Yeah.
- God, that's just weird.
Who does that?
Oh!
And the patterns emerge!
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.
Skinny Jeans George,
Skinny Jeans Harry,
Skinny Jeans Vinnie.
Vinnie lasted
for at least two weeks.
He was one of the longer ones.
- I don't like dating.
You know that.
I don't like dating.
I don't like the...
I don't like it.
I get bored.
I don't like it.
- Do you know how
the Iris dating scheme
works these days?
(laughs)
No, you don't.
- Okay, this is basically
how it works,
I mean, in a nutshell.
So they come in
with the skinny jeans
that... yes, skinnier than these,


                                    Page 35/60

by the way.
Then we've got
the rocker stud belt,
the Converse, no socks,
tongue open, no shoelaces,
the swoopy haircut.
- Which you have right now,
by the way.
- Well, I have it
'cause I have hair problems.
These guys are young enough.
They should not be swooping.
It starts out
usually on a Friday,
'cause she met him
at a coffee shop.
Saturday night, we go to either
Fleet Foxes or Band of Horses...
- I like Fleet Foxes.
- Or some sort of
Light in The Attic show.
And then she takes them
to the greasy spoon breakfast
the next morning.
She's like, ""I'm such
the greasy spoon girl,""
and then they get
very, very excited about her.
And the next weekend they call,
and she does coffee.
And then it's done.
- And why are you
almost defending them?
You hate all of the guys
that I've been out with.
You've hated all of them.
- Well, the problem is...
- I get very bored.
You know that.
- You have great taste in life,
and you have
terrible taste in men.
- You have terrible taste
in clothes.


                                   Page 36/60

- Of course I do.
I never said...
- Those denim shorts are
a horror show.
- Don't... don't talk about
the jean shorts.
Don't, don't.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
- The fact that
you've somehow managed
to get the inner seam higher
than the outer seam
is so creepy.
- God is in the details.
I'm sorry.
- I never want to see
those things again.
- Remember the guy who asked you
to cut your bush?
Remember?
The guy that you
were hooking up with
that told you to trim
your bush and...
- Okay, we're good.
- No, no, no.
She came home in tears,
because she was hooking up
with this guy.
Remember that guy?
And she had a little poof
in her underwear.
- Okay, you know...
- And she's like, ""I didn't know
I'm supposed to trim my bush.""
(both laughing)
- I was so embarrassed.
- And I was, like,
the bad older sister
'cause I didn't tell her.
- What the fuck are you doing?
I didn't.
It was...
(laughing)


                                   Page 37/60

- Anyway, that's the only
boyfriend story I remember.
- You suck.
That is so wrong, by the way.
- What?
- That's very wrong.
- These are the guys...
- Okay, we're good,
we're good, we're good.
We're done.
We're done.
Okay?
- Okay, we're done.
I'm just gonna eat another vat
of mashed potatoes.
- How are you liking
those mashed potatoes?
- They're outrageous.
- Yeah?
They taste good?
- Mm-hmm.
- How vegan do they taste
to you?
Come on.
I put a dollop of butter in.
That was it.
Don't rinse out.
Come on.
You've been plowing through
those things.
Do you know why
they tasted good?
Because they have dairy in them.
That's why.
- Why would you do that?
- Because I felt like it.
- That's five pounds of fear
right there that I just ate.
- It was meant to be a joke
just 'cause...
to see if you liked it.
- It was meant to be a joke.
- I mean,
it's just so not cool.


                                   Page 38/60

- Okay, okay.
You're right.
It's not cool.
Are you allergic to butter,
though?
- No, I'm emotionally allergic
to butter.
- I'm sorry.
It was just a little bit.
It was just a tablespoon.
I like butter
in my mashed potato,
and that was all it was.
- All right.
- Don't, Hannah.
- That was delicious
and inhumane and...
I'll see you guys
in the morning.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- I love you,
but I don't like you.
- All right.
- Thank you, Jack.
- Good night, Hannah.
(birds calling)
- Hannah?
- Hmm?
- Hello.
(giggles)
- I'm sleeping.
- I know.
I can't sleep.
It's because I'm so excited
that you're here.
- Well, try.
- What?
- Try.
- I can't.
(sighs)
- Do you want to talk?
- Mm-mm.
(laughs)


                                 Page 39/60

- Go to bed.
- I can't.
- Well, sleep here, but, shh.
- Okay.
Can I just have one question?
- Hmm?
- Do you like Jack?
- Yeah, he's all right.
- Hmm?
- I said he's all right.
- What do you think of him?
- I don't know.
I just met him.
- Yeah, but, you know,
you're very good
at working people out.
- I don't know.
He seems like a nice guy.
- Mm-hmm.
- He's a good cook.
Asshole.
- Sorry about the potato.
I hate that bush story.
- I'm sorry about that.
- I, like, hate it so much.
It's so, so embarrassing.
- It's a good story.
- Yeah, for you.
(laughs)
- I don't know.
He's funny, I guess.
- He's very funny.
- And full of himself.
- Well, it's because
he's nervous, though.
He just gets a little posture-y
when he's nervous.
He's really smart.
- So do you like him?
- Yeah, he's my friend.
- No, I mean, do you like him
like him?
- Yeah.
I think I'm in love with him.


                                  Page 40/60

- Wow.
- Yeah.
Do you think that's weird?
- No.
No.
- Because of Tom,
I think it might be weird.
- I don't know.
- He made this, like,
really drunken pass at me once.
And it was right after
I broke up with Tom.
And it was completely
embarrassing, but...
He was so upset
the next day,
you know, mortified.
And...
And I was kind of happy
that it happened.
So I guess I thought then
that I shouldn't...
shouldn't tell him.
Do you think that
I should tell him?
No.
- No, not no.
Uh-uh...
- He's so sweet.
- I think you should sleep
on it.
- Sleep on it?
I thought you were gonna say,
""I think you should
sleep with him.""
(laughs)
- That's my usual advice.
- I just think
I might fuck everything up,
because maybe
we know each other too well,
you know?
And he'd be totally
weirded out, and...


                                  Page 41/60

- Sleep on it.
- Okay.
- In your own bed.
- Okay.
- I'm exhausted.
- Okay.
- I love you.
- I love you.
It's nice to see you.
- So good to see you,
Peanut.
(both chuckling)
- Okay.
(sighs)
- Hi, Stink Bomb.
- Hey.
How are you?
- What are you doing?
- Just chilling.
Reading.
- Are you not sleeping?
- I can't sleep.
Can you not sleep?
Here.
Thanks.
- Yeah.
- What do you think of her?
- I think she's great.
You know, I really like her,
and she seems great.
(laughs)
Do you not like her?
- No, I just said I like her.
I do.
- Did you... what did you guys
do last night?
- We, um...
Nothing.
You know, it was just,
like, small talk,
getting to know
each other a little bit.
And it was nice.
- Do you think


                                 Page 42/60

that she's pretty?
- I think she is
empirically attractive.
(laughs)
- What?
- ""Technically speaking she is,
uh, pretty attractive.""
- Whatever.
She's a pretty girl.
Yeah.
- She's really pretty.
- She's a pretty girl.
- This is her room.
Do you know that?
- This is her room?
- You're in her room.
- That's weird.
Why'd she put me in here?
(laughs)
She hates this room.
(laughing)
- Maybe that's why
she put me in here.
- She does.
She really hates this room.
She hasn't even unpacked.
- Wow.
- Yeah, that's all her stuff.
Shit.
- What is that?
- This is all her paintings.
I don't know if she even knows
they're here.
She hasn't picked up a brush
in years, but...
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.
These are all
from around here.
And this is a nudist beach
on the other side
of the island.
- On this island?
- Yep.


                                  Page 43/60

- That's crazy.
- Anyway...
- Anyway.
I got to tell you something.
- What?
- I...
- What?
- I am too old to ride bicycles
to islands.
(laughs)
- Anyway,
that's my big confession
for the night.
(birds chirping)
(sighing and snoring)
(gasps)
You just put your foot
in my face,
you son of a bitch.
- What?
- You just put your foot
in my face.
- No, I didn't.
- You did.
- Shit head.
(laughs)
(birds chirping)
(waves lapping)
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You were right.
- About what?
- It's just, um,
better if she doesn't know.
Cool?
- Yeah, that's...
that's good for me, yeah.
(waves lapping)
- Just like that.
- Ew, it's a gloopy.
- I prefer ""eye booger.""
- Oh...
- What are... what are we
in for here?


                                  Page 44/60

- Hmm?
- What are we in for here?
- I have no idea.
- Are you guys ready for
the best gluten-free, vegan,
soy-free pancakes
you're ever gonna eat?
- Mmm.
- Absolutely.
- Seriously,
these are delicious.
- They look really good.
- You can have a little
sad pancake.
- There's the little man.
- Look, two little
sad pancakes.
- Oh, he is a little sad.
I'll make him happy.
- Tell me if you miss
anything,
'cause I would be very surprised
if you do.
- Okay.
- Um... oh!
Maple syrup.
- Maple syrup.
- Oh, shoot.
Okay, you know what?
No maple syrup, but we do have
cashew butter.
- Mmm.
Amazing.
- They're good?
- Mm!
- Oh, my God.
I'm so excited.
- That's great.
- So good.
- They're actually even good
without it.
But I will try it with.
See how we do.
- I put that stuff on


                                   Page 45/60

everything.
It is delish.
- Yeah?
Mmm.
Good.
- They're good?
- Very good.
- Very good.
- I'm so happy
you guys like them.
I mean, do you miss it?
Do you even miss the butter
and the milk?
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.
- They're terrible.
(laughing)
No, they're not.
- They're so bad.
- They're so good, right?
Aren't they good?
- I think ""terrible""
is an extreme word.
I think that
they are challenged,
but they are...
- I think it's
a very good effort.
- It's not.
You know what it is?
The flax seeds
didn't do a good job.
I put flax seeds in
to replace the egg,
and usually I use coconut oil,
but we didn't have any.
And it's just...
- Well, you didn't have
the right ingredients.
- We didn't.
- This is what I think.
We'll have a second round.
- Okay.
- You get all


                                 Page 46/60

the right ingredients.
I'll make my pancakes,
you make yours,
and we'll have, like,
a pancake-off.
And then whoever wins will win,
like, a...
- Trip to, uh, IHOP.
- A trip to IHOP.
But make sure you bring
your passport,
'cause it's international,
you know.
- Right.
(laughter)
Well done.
Sorry, you guys.
- Don't be sorry.
- Do you know what
I'm so excited about?
- What?
- You.
- What do you mean?
- I'm happy you've left her.
I think that's what
I'm trying to say.
- I think I'm happy too.
- I've kind of missed seeing
your face like this.
It's the first time I've seen
you look really happy
in a long time.
That's awesome.
Despite the terrible pancakes.
(laughs)
- You do.
It's really lovely for me.
I've missed you, you know,
seeing you.
Fuck Pam.
- Fuck her.
- Fuck Pam.
- Fuck Pam.
- Fuck Pam.


                                  Page 47/60

- Fuck Pam.
Or don't fuck Pam.
Fuck someone else now.
You can do anything
you want now.
That's the thing.
It's really exciting.
You can go traveling now.
You're not stuck in...
- I can.
I was thinking about that.
- You can go to India.
You can find yourself,
like Lenora.
You can do whatever you want.
You can have a baby now.
(laughs)
A baby?
- She's always wanted them.
She's always wanted them.
- That's right where
my mind goes.
Let me go have a baby now.
- No, I've been thinking
about it, that she's...
she's always wanted one
as well.
She has actually always wanted
a baby.
You should try.
Now is your time.
I mean, were you trying?
Were you even trying?
- Yeah, I mean, we had...
you know, we'd been
talking about it.
- She never wanted them,
though.
- But she said she did.
- Yeah, she said was gonna...
she said she was gonna relent
at some point.
And I don't think she ever
wanted them.


                                 Page 48/60

And you have such
an opportunity now, you know?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Are you embarrassed a bit?
It's probably embarrassing,
in front of Jack.
- No. No.
It's just... yeah.
I mean...
We just...
it wasn't on the table.
At the end of the day,
it wasn't...
uh, wasn't to be,
so moving on.
- All right,
I'm just saying
that there's
tons of stuff you can do.
- Travel.
- No, but you... there's...
don't change the subject.
This is what you want.
There's sperm donors.
There's like...
- Christ.
- Yeah.
- It's expensive.
- But what I'm saying now
is that there's, like...
you can go online.
There's sperm donors.
There's sperm in the air.
You just grab a dude
and preg yourself up.
- That sounds horrible.
(both laughing)
- Pick a guy.
Any guy.
It would just be one night,
and then you're done.
- I'm gonna get some coffee.
Would you like a refill?


                                Page 49/60

- Mm-hmm.
- Hannah, would you like
something?
- Ah, yes.
Thank you.
Refresh, please.
- Coffee?
Okay.
Good.
I'll be right back.
(whispers)
I need to talk to you.
(mouthing words)
(mouthing words)
- Let's go for a walk.
- Okay. Good.
Um, we're going to go
for a walk, Jack-Jack.
You're gonna stay here
and think about your life.
Come on, Hannah.
- I'm going for a walk.
- Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, quick.
Um, just wanted to check in
with you real quick.
So I don't know exactly
how to put this,
but it definitely was
a little weird.
I didn't know about you
and your relationship to,
like, wanting a baby and stuff,
which is great, obviously.
But, in terms of, like,
the whole, like,
""Oh, just grab a guy,
and there's sperm everywhere,""
Like, it definitely made me
think for a sec.
Our first night...
I hate to even bring it up,
but I feel like I should just...
- We used a condom.


                                   Page 50/60

- That's true.
Yeah, you're right.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Are we good?
Okay, thanks.
Sorry about that.
I didn't mean to...
- See you later.
- Backtrack.
I just felt like
double-checking.
Safety first.
- Yeah, and the thought of it
is scary,
and it's all
of those things.
And if I'm gonna do it,
I just feel like
I should just tell him.
And I thought about it
all night.
And we slept in the same
fucking bed, you know.
And it's just the comfort
and the ease that we have.
I just don't believe
that just evaporates.
I hope, anyway.
I just feel like I've got
to take this leap.
And I was lying there
last night,
and I couldn't
get to sleep.
And he's snoring next to me,
and I'm, like,
""Just tell him.
Just fucking tell him.""
You know, I just...
I just have to.
I think it's time.
And I don't even know
what he's gonna think


                                Page 51/60

or what he's gonna say.
I just feel like
I've got to stop
feeling so passive about things,
you know?
What's the matter?
Why are you being so quiet?
(scoffs quietly)
- You don't think
I should do it?
- No, I have
to tell you something.
And I have to tell you something
before I tell you something.
The first thing
that I'm gonna tell you,
you're going to have
a big problem with.
So I think I'm just
gonna tell you.
- Okay.
(sighs)
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Oh.
(door slams)
- Iris!
- Jack!
- Whoa, whoa.
What's going on?
What's going on?
- You fucked my sister.
You fucked my sister!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Look, I'm so sorry.
- You were here for one night.
She's a fucking lesbian.
- It was a total mistake.
You should never
have known about it.
I'm so sorry,
but there's something


                                   Page 52/60

much bigger at work here...
Hannah!
- Iris, I'm so sorry.
- Tell her about the condom.
Hannah, tell her
about the condom.
- What's he talking about?
- Tell her.
I found the condom!
- What'd you do?
Why were you looking
for the condom?
What's going on?
- Well, well, why?
You know why?
Because she poked holes
in the condom.
- Can you just shut up
for one second?
- No, you poked holes
in the condom.
It's a fucking rain shower!
She tried to steal my sperm.
- I didn't try to steal
your sperm.
- Well, then, what was that?
- Did you poke holes
in a condom, Hannah?
- No.
Yes.
- Why?
- No, I was trying...
I was trying to get pregnant.
- With Jack?
- Yeah.
- No.
Not with Jack.
With someone.
- Oh, my God.
- Jack, you didn't even...
you weren't even gonna know.
- Oh, I wasn't going to know?
- It was going
into a little plastic sack


                                Page 53/60

and get thrown
into the trash.
- Exactly!
Where sperm belongs
so it doesn't become
a fucking baby
that I don't know about!
- Okay, so this...
let me just clear this up.
You potentially could be
pregnant with his baby.
Is that what...
is that what you're telling me?
- I don't know.
- Holy shit.
Holy shit.
You had to pick him,
didn't you?
You had go pick Jack.
- I didn't pick him.
- All the guys.
All of the guys,
and you had to go and pick him.
- I wasn't trying to pick him.
I was just...
- Why?
Why did it have to be him?
- I didn't know you were
in love with him!
How could I know you were
in love with him?
I would never have done that.
I don't want to hurt you.
I didn't know.
(whispers)
What are you doing?
- I don't know.
I just wanted a baby.
I'm sorry.
(whispers)
Fuck.
(whispers)
I fucked up.
- Fuck.

(exhales sharply)
I am a really bad person.
(door slams)
(water lapping)
(owl hooting)
(knocking at door)
- Can I talk to you
for a second?
- No.
I don't want to talk to you,
Jack.
(sighs)
- Hey, hey.
- I really think your face
is going to annoy me right now.
I don't want to talk to you.
- My face always annoys you.
(sighs)
- I'm so sorry.
- Why did you do that?
Did you not think that
that would be weird for me?
Did you not think that, like,
even if I hadn't found out
that that would be weird thing,
that you'd have to carry that
and still be friends with me?
- It's weird.
It's definitely weird.
But it's, like, I...
I slept with your sister,
and you slept with my brother.
And I don't know.
I don't even...
This is just
so confusing.
There's a lot happening
right now.
But I can't...
I can't come between you
and your sister, okay?
That is not something
I can ever do.
- I can't even think about her


                                  Page 55/60

right now.
- She...
- I don't want anything to do
with her right now, okay?
- I just know I saw her
when you left the room,
and she loves you,
and she's sorry.
You can never understand
how important
the bond is that you have
with your sister.
You will never understand
the way I do.
I could never live with myself
if I knew, in some way,
I might be coming between you
or the cause of any of that.
And what I did was a mistake,
and it's the worst fucking
mistake I have ever made.
But I didn't...
Oh, fuck.
(sobs)
I didn't sleep with your sister
'cause I wanted to sleep
with your sister.
I slept with your sister
because I can't be with you.
I have to go.
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.
- You gonna come back?
(door slams)
(sighs)
(water lapping)
(door slams)
I made some potatoes
if you want some.
(sighing)
(sighs)
(sighs)
- Iris?
- Yeah?


                                  Page 56/60

- I'm sorry.
(water lapping)
- Morning.
(both laughing and chattering)
Have you thought about what
you're gonna do,
you know, if there's a baby?
- Not really.
- 'Cause I was just thinking
that I wouldn't want you to...
feel alone,
you know?
And if you wanted any help
that that would be
something I could do.
You know that I could help you
raise the baby.
I have a spare room.
- Are you sure that's what
you'd be up for,
want to do,
could bite off?
I don't know.
- Yeah, I think it is.
I could do the 3:00 a.m. feed,
you know?
I don't know.
I've just been thinking
about it.
It's whatever you want.
- I think I'd like that.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Thanks,
just, you know,
for the offer, even,
even if there is no baby.
- It's okay.
- Warm up?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
(kids chattering)
(kids laughing and chattering)

- Here comes
the milk police car.
- Here comes
the milk race car.
(imitating sirens)
- Whoever has the Sun,
turn it on!
(chain rattling)
- Fuck.
(chain rattling)
Fuck!
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
(grunts)
- I think if you see
two together, it's good luck.
- The crows?
- Yeah, and one
is a spirit guide.
(both laughing)
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
I have something I want to say
to you guys, okay?
I'm unemployed,
and I'm financially unstable,
and I am emotionally, at best,
precarious,
at worst, a cripple.
And I'm not in a place
in my life
to be any sort
of father figure, potentially.
And I'm certainly,
as your best friend,
no one I would recommend
as a boyfriend.
And that sucks,
because you...
might be carrying my baby,
and I'm in love


                                 Page 58/60

with your sister.
But...
I'm tired of being dead,
and I want
to come back to life.
So if there, you know,
is a baby in there,
you absolutely
should have that.
And I would love to help
if you want me...
not pushy, just available,
be it friend or uncle
or dad-ish,
on some level.
And you.
I don't deserve you.
But I would give you
every fucking thing
that I have.
And if you guys would consider
having me,
I'm asking for a shot.
(laughs)
- I love you.
- And I love you.
- Come here.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Come on.
Don't be silly.
Come here, sperm stealer.
(laughter)
(clock ticking)
(sighs)
(chuckles)
(alarm rings)
- Okay.
- Okay.
All right, all right, all right,
all right, all right.
(sighs)
(peaceful acoustic music)
When I was playin' dead


                                   Page 59/60

I'd lie down
I wouldn't move
Though everything else was
The swing set
Kids playin' catch
with their dads
No one noticed yet
that I was gone
Then she came along
And, love,
I got you, didn't I?
I got you, didn't I?
I got you
And, love,
I got you, didn't I?
I got you, didn't I?
I got you
When I was playin' dead
I'd lie down
I wouldn't move
Though everything else was
The swing set
Kids playin' catch
with their dads
No one noticed yet
When I was alive
I didn't know why I died
I guess I thought everything
was that way
Your hair is gray
In other lights,
it's black
And when you laugh
Still brings me back
And, love,
I got you, didn't I?
I got you, didn't I?
I got you
And, love,
I got you, didn't I?
I got you, didn't I?
You got me
